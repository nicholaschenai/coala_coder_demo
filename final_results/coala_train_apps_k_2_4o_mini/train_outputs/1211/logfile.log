## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The chef is having one string of English lower case alphabets only. The chef wants to remove all "abc" special pairs where a,b,c are occurring consecutively. After removing the pair, create a new string and again remove "abc" special pair from a newly formed string. Repeate the process until no such pair remains in a string.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single line of input, $String$. 

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line answer, new String with no "abc" special pair.

-----Constraints:-----
$T \leq 2 $
$1 \leq String length \leq 1000 $

-----Sample Input:-----
2
aabcc
bababccc

-----Sample Output:-----
ac
bc

-----EXPLANATION:-----
For 1) after removing "abc" at middle we get a new string as ac.
For 2) string = bababccc
newString1 = babcc  // After removing middle "abc"
newString2 = bc   //After removing "abc"

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

INFO - [Task id] 1211 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem requires us to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from a given string until no such substring exists. We need to do this for multiple test cases, and for each test case, we will output the final string after all possible removals.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a loop to check for the presence of the substring "abc" in the string. If it is found, we will remove it and check the resulting string again. This process will continue until the substring "abc" can no longer be found in the string. We will repeat this for each test case provided.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function remove_abc_pairs(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           while "abc" is in test_case:
               remove the first occurrence of "abc" from test_case
           output test_case
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def remove_abc_pairs(test_cases):
    # Iterate through each test case
    results = []
    for s in test_cases:
        # Continue removing "abc" until it no longer exists in the string
        while "abc" in s:
            s = s.replace("abc", "")  # Remove the first occurrence of "abc"
        results.append(s)  # Store the result for this test case
    return results  # Return all results

# Read input
T = int(input())  # Number of test cases
test_cases = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]  # Read each test case

# Get results
results = remove_abc_pairs(test_cases)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)  # Output each result on a new line

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
           We need to find the shortest string that can contain all the given strings as substrings. The strings in the input list are guaranteed not to be substrings of one another.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
           To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach to generate all possible permutations of the input strings. For each permutation, we will merge the strings together while ensuring that we only add the necessary characters to maintain the substring property. We will keep track of the shortest merged string found during this process.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function shortestSuperstring(A):
               initialize shortest_string as an empty string
               for each permutation of A:
                   merged_string = merge_strings(permutation)
                   if shortest_string is empty or length of merged_string < length of shortest_string:
                       shortest_string = merged_string
               return shortest_string

           function merge_strings(strings):
               start with the first string as merged
               for each string in strings starting from the second:
                   overlap = find_max_overlap(merged, string)
                   add the non-overlapping part of string to merged
               return merged

           function find_max_overlap(s1, s2):
               max_overlap = 0
               for i from 1 to length of s1:
                   if s1[i:] is equal to s2[:length of s1 - i]:
                       max_overlap = length of s1 - i
               return max_overlap

[Summary]:
    The task was to find the shortest superstring that contains all given strings as substrings. The initial approach involved generating all permutations of the input strings and merging them based on maximum overlaps. However, the merging logic was flawed, as it did not correctly account for overlaps in both directions, leading to incorrect outputs.

    Key concepts involved in this problem include:
    - **Permutations**: Exploring all possible orders of the input strings to find the optimal merging.
    - **String Overlap Calculation**: Merging strings based on the maximum overlap, which should consider overlaps from both strings in both directions.

    Despite multiple attempts to refine the merging logic, the implementation consistently failed to produce the expected results. The merging function needed to be more robust in calculating overlaps, and the overall strategy of generating permutations was sound but required a more effective merging mechanism.

    The final code snippet aimed to address these issues but still did not pass the tests. The merging function was supposed to find the maximum overlap between two strings, but it failed to produce the correct order of strings in the final output. 

    Hereâ€™s the last version of the merging function for reference:

    ```python
    def merge_strings(s1, s2):
        max_overlap = 0
        # Find maximum overlap length from s1 to s2
        for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):
            if s1[i-1:] == s2[:len(s1) - i + 1]:
                max_overlap = len(s1) - i + 1
        # Find maximum overlap length from s2 to s1
        for i in range(1, len(s2) + 1):
            if s2[i-1:] == s1[:len(s2) - i + 1]:
                max_overlap = max(max_overlap, len(s2) - i + 1)
        # Merge the strings based on the maximum overlap found
        return s1 + s2[max_overlap:]
    ```

    In summary, the main takeaway is the importance of correctly implementing the overlap logic in string merging problems, as well as the need to thoroughly test edge cases to ensure robustness.

INFO - [Task id] 1211 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from a given string until there are no more occurrences of "abc". This process needs to be applied to multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a loop to check for the presence of the substring "abc" in the string. If it exists, we will remove it and check the resulting string again. We will continue this process until the substring "abc" can no longer be found in the string. This will be done for each test case provided.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function remove_abc_pairs(string):
       while "abc" is in string:
           remove the first occurrence of "abc" from string
       return string

   function main():
       read T (number of test cases)
       for each test case:
           read string
           result = remove_abc_pairs(string)
           print result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def remove_abc_pairs(string):
    # Continue removing "abc" until it no longer exists in the string
    while "abc" in string:

INFO - [Task id] 1211 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such substring remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging string manipulation methods in Python.

The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string operations and loops efficiently. The solution utilized the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of "abc" in each iteration, which worked well within the constraints provided (string length up to 1000 and a maximum of 2 test cases).

The final implementation was clean and straightforward, with a helper function `remove_abc_pairs` to encapsulate the logic for removing "abc". The main function handled input and output, ensuring the program could process multiple test cases in sequence. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all provided test cases successfully. 

Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of understanding string manipulation and iterative processes in programming. The solution can be reused or adapted for similar problems involving substring removal or pattern matching in strings.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
# cook your dish here
for _ in range(int(input())):
    s=input()
    while(s.count("abc")!=0):
        s=s.replace("abc","")
    print(s)    


INFO - [Task id] 1211 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem by using a while loop that checks for the presence of the substring "abc" in the input string. It utilizes the `count` method to determine if "abc" exists and the `replace` method to remove all occurrences of "abc" in one go. This approach is straightforward and ensures that the string is processed until no "abc" substrings remain.

One key insight from the official solution is the use of `s.count("abc")` to check for occurrences, which simplifies the condition for the while loop. My initial approach used `in` to check for the substring, which is also valid but less explicit in terms of counting occurrences. Additionally, the official solution removes all instances of "abc" in a single call to `replace`, which can be more efficient than removing them one at a time.

Overall, the official solution is concise and leverages built-in string methods effectively, making it both easy to read and efficient. In future implementations, I should consider using `count` for clarity and efficiency when dealing with substring removal in loops.
