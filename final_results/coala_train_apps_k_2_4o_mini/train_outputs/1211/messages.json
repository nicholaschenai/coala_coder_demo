The initial approach involved generating all permutations of the input strings and merging them based on maximum overlaps. However, the merging logic was flawed, as it did not correctly account for overlaps in both directions, leading to incorrect outputs.\n\n    Key concepts involved in this problem include:\n    - **Permutations**: Exploring all possible orders of the input strings to find the optimal merging.\n    - **String Overlap Calculation**: Merging strings based on the maximum overlap, which should consider overlaps from both strings in both directions.\n\n    Despite multiple attempts to refine the merging logic, the implementation consistently failed to produce the expected results. The merging function needed to be more robust in calculating overlaps, and the overall strategy of generating permutations was sound but required a more effective merging mechanism.\n\n    The final code snippet aimed to address these issues but still did not pass the tests. The merging function was supposed to find the maximum overlap between two strings, but it failed to produce the correct order of strings in the final output. \n\n    Here\u2019s the last version of the merging function for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def merge_strings(s1, s2):\n        max_overlap = 0\n        # Find maximum overlap length from s1 to s2\n        for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):\n            if s1[i-1:] == s2[:len(s1) - i + 1]:\n                max_overlap = len(s1) - i + 1\n        # Find maximum overlap length from s2 to s1\n        for i in range(1, len(s2) + 1):\n            if s2[i-1:] == s1[:len(s2) - i + 1]:\n                max_overlap = max(max_overlap, len(s2) - i + 1)\n        # Merge the strings based on the maximum overlap found\n        return s1 + s2[max_overlap:]\n    ```\n\n    In summary, the main takeaway is the importance of correctly implementing the overlap logic in string merging problems, as well as the need to thoroughly test edge cases to ensure robustness.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
