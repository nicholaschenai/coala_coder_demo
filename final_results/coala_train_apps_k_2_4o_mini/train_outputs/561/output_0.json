    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to determine if Gru can distribute his money to a number of minions such that he spends exactly the amount he has. Each minion demands a certain amount of money, and Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount they demand is less than or equal to the amount Gru has left. The goal is to check if Gru can distribute all his money without any leftover.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   For each test case, we will sum up the total amount of money demanded by all minions. If this total is equal to the amount of money Gru has, then the answer is \"YES\". If the total is less than the amount Gru has, we need to check if all demands can be satisfied without exceeding the amount Gru has. If the total is greater than the amount Gru has, then it's impossible to satisfy all demands, and the answer is \"NO\".\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n       for each case in test_cases:\n           N = case[0]  # Number of minions\n           K = case[1]  # Amount of money Gru has\n           demands = case[2]  # List of demands from minions\n           total_demand = sum(demands)  # Calculate total demand from all minions\n           \n           if total_demand == K:\n               print(\"YES\")  # Gru can distribute all his money\n           else:\n               print(\"NO\")  # Gru cannot distribute all his money\n\n   read T\n   read test_cases\n   can_distribute_money(T, test_cases)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n    # Iterate through each test case\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N = case[0]  # Read the number of minions\n        K = case[1]  # Read the amount of money Gru has\n        demands = case[2]  # Read the list of demands from minions\n        total_demand = sum(demands)  # Calculate the total demand from all minions\n        \n        # Check if the total demand matches the amount Gru has\n        if total_demand == K:\n            print(\"YES\")  # Gru can distribute all his money\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")  # Gru cannot distribute all his money\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\n\n# Read each test case\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())  # Read the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has\n    demands = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the demands from minions\n    test_cases.append((N, K, demands))  # Store the test case\n\n# Call the function with the number of test cases and the test cases\ncan_distribute_money(T, test_cases)\n```",
