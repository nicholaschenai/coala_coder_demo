    "raw_msg": "Let's analyze the problem again and ensure we implement the correct logic to determine if Gru can distribute his money to the minions such that he spends exactly the amount he has.\n\n### Problem Recap:\n- Gru has a total amount of money \\( K \\).\n- There are \\( N \\) minions, each demanding a certain amount of money.\n- We need to determine if Gru can distribute exactly \\( K \\) amount of money to the minions based on their demands.\n\n### Key Points:\n1. If the total demand from all minions is equal to \\( K \\), then the answer is \"YES\".\n2. If the total demand is less than \\( K \\), we need to check if the remaining money can be distributed among the minions without exceeding their demands.\n3. If the total demand is greater than \\( K \\), then it's impossible to satisfy all demands, and the answer should be \"NO\".\n\n### Revised Logic:\n- Calculate the total demand from all minions.\n- Compare the total demand with \\( K \\):\n  - If total demand equals \\( K \\), print \"YES\".\n  - If total demand is less than \\( K \\), print \"YES\" (since Gru can distribute the remaining money).\n  - If total demand is greater than \\( K \\), print \"NO\".\n\n### Corrected Python Code:\n```python\ndef can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n    # Iterate through each test case\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N = case[0]  # Read the number of minions\n        K = case[1]  # Read the amount of money Gru has\n        demands = case[2]  # Read the list of demands from minions\n        total_demand = sum(demands)  # Calculate the total demand from all minions\n        \n        # Check if the total demand matches the amount Gru has\n        if total_demand == K:\n            print(\"YES\")  # Gru can distribute all his money\n        elif total_demand < K:\n            print(\"YES\")  # Gru can distribute the remaining money\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")  # Total demand is greater than K\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\n\n# Read each test case\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())  # Read the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has\n    demands = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the demands from minions\n    test_cases.append((N, K, demands))  # Store the test case\n\n# Call the function with the number of test cases and the test cases\ncan_distribute_money(T, test_cases)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- The function `can_distribute_money` processes each test case by reading the number of minions, the amount of money Gru has, and the demands from the minions.\n- It calculates the total demand and checks:\n  - If the total demand equals \\( K \\), it prints \"YES\".\n  - If the total demand is less than \\( K \\), it also prints \"YES\" since Gru can distribute the remaining money.\n  - If the total demand is greater than \\( K \\), it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis code should now correctly handle the distribution of money based on the demands of the minions and Gru's total amount.",
