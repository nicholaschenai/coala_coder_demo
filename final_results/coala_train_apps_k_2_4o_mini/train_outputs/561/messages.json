There are N minions in total. Each of them owns a house. On this Festival, Each of them wants to decorate their house. But none of them have enough money to do that. One of the minion, Kevin, requested Gru for money. Gru agreed for money distribution but he will be giving money to a minion if and only if demanded money is less than or equal to the money Gru have. Now Gru wonders if he can spend all the money or not.\n\n-----Input-----\nFirst line have number of test cases T. Each test case consist of Two Lines. First line contains two space separated integers N and K i.e. Number of minions and Amount of Money Gru have. Next line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,A3,.....,AN representing amount of money demanded by ith minion.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput YES if Gru can spend his all of the money on minions i.e. after distribution Gru have zero amount of money else NO.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 105\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 102\n- 1 \u2264 K,Ai \u2264 109\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n2 \n4 9\n5 2 2 4\n4 9\n5 2 18 3\n\nOutput:\nYES\nNO\n\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to first minion then remaining 4 Rs. can be given to 2nd and 3rd minion or to the 4th minion. Which will leave zero amount of money in the hands of Gru.\nExample case 2.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to the first minion then from remaining 4 Rs. either he can give 2 Rs. to the 2nd minion or 3 Rs. to the fourth minion. Which will leave either 2 Rs. or 1 Rs. in the hands of Gru.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The key concepts involved were understanding the operations allowed and calculating the total sum of the sequence and the maximum possible reduction.\n\n    Initially, the logic incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it would always be possible to make the sequence good. This led to incorrect outputs, especially when the total sum was negative. The correct approach involved checking if the total sum was negative (in which case it was impossible to make it zero) and ensuring that if the total sum was positive, it could be reduced to zero using the maximum reduction available.\n\n    The final solution correctly implemented these checks:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            A = case[1]\n            total_sum = sum(A)\n            max_reduction = sum(i for i in range(1, N + 1))\n        \n            if total_sum < 0:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            elif total_sum <= max_reduction:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering edge cases and the implications of the operations allowed on the sequence.

The key concepts involved were understanding the operations allowed and calculating the total sum of the sequence and the maximum possible reduction.\n\n    Initially, the logic incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it would always be possible to make the sequence good. This led to incorrect outputs, especially when the total sum was negative. The correct approach involved checking if the total sum was negative (in which case it was impossible to make it zero) and ensuring that if the total sum was positive, it could be reduced to zero using the maximum reduction available.\n\n    The final solution correctly implemented these checks:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            A = case[1]\n            total_sum = sum(A)\n            max_reduction = sum(i for i in range(1, N + 1))\n        \n            if total_sum < 0:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            elif total_sum <= max_reduction:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering edge cases and the implications of the operations allowed on the sequence.

Thus, we should return \"NO\" in that case.\n           - If the total sum is positive, we need to check if we can reduce it to zero using the maximum reduction available.\n\n        4. **Revising the Logic:**\n           - If the total sum is less than or equal to zero, we can return \"YES\" because we can reduce the elements to make the sum zero.\n           - If the total sum is positive, we need to check if the maximum reduction (sum of indices) is greater than or equal to the total sum.\n\n        Now, let's implement the corrected logic in the code.\n\n        ```python\n        def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):\n            # Iterate through each test case\n            for case in test_cases:\n                N = case[0]  # Read the size of the sequence\n                A = case[1]  # Read the sequence of integers\n                total_sum = sum(A)  # Calculate the total sum of the sequence\n                max_reduction = sum(i for i in range(1, N + 1))  # Calculate the maximum possible reduction\n        \n                # Check if we can reduce the total sum to zero\n                if total_sum <= 0 or total_sum <= max_reduction:\n                    print(\"YES\")  # It's possible to make the sequence good\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")  # It's not possible to make the sequence good\n\n        # Read the number of test cases\n        T = int(input())\n        test_cases = []\n\n        # Read each test case\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())  # Read the size of the sequence\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the sequence of integers\n            test_cases.append((N, A))  # Store the test case\n\n        # Call the function with the number of test cases and the test cases\n        can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases)\n        ``` \n\n        This revised code should correctly determine if the sequence can be made \"good\" based on the conditions outlined.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Based on the insights and corrections needed from the previous attempts, here is the revised solution for the problem of determining if a sequence can be made \"good\" (i.e., the sum of its elements can be made zero). \n\n        The key points to address are:\n        - We need to check if the total sum of the sequence can be reduced to zero using the allowed operations.\n        - If the total sum is negative, we cannot make it zero, so we return \"NO\".\n        - If the total sum is positive, we check if the maximum reduction possible (sum of indices) is sufficient to bring the total sum down to zero.\n\n        Here\u2019s the corrected Python code:\n\n        ```python\n        def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):\n            # Iterate through each test case\n            for case in test_cases:\n                N = case[0]  # Read the size of the sequence\n                A = case[1]  # Read the sequence of integers\n                total_sum = sum(A)  # Calculate the total sum of the sequence\n                max_reduction = sum(i for i in range(1, N + 1))  # Calculate the maximum possible reduction\n        \n                # Check if we can reduce the total sum to zero\n                if total_sum <= max_reduction:\n                    print(\"YES\")  # It's possible to make the sequence good\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")  # It's not possible to make the sequence good\n\n        # Read the number of test cases\n        T = int(input())\n        test_cases = []\n\n        # Read each test case\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())  # Read the size of the sequence\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the sequence of integers\n            test_cases.append((N, A))  # Store the test case\n\n        # Call the function with the number of test cases and the test cases\n        can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases)\n        ```\n\n        This code correctly implements the logic to determine if the sequence can be made good by checking the total sum against the maximum possible reduction.

        "content": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\nIn my attempts to solve the problem of determining if Gru can distribute his money to the minions, I initially focused on summing the demands and comparing them to the total amount of money Gru has. However, this approach failed to account for the nuances of the problem, particularly the need to consider combinations of demands that could sum up to exactly \\( K \\). My solution incorrectly assumed that if the total demand was less than \\( K \\), Gru could always distribute the remaining money, which is not necessarily true.\n\nThe official solution takes a different approach by using a recursive function to find all combinations of the demands that can sum up to \\( K \\). This method effectively explores all possible subsets of the demands, allowing it to determine if there exists a combination that matches Gru's total money. The use of recursion and backtracking in the official solution is a more comprehensive way to address the problem, ensuring that all potential distributions are considered.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n- It uses a recursive function to explore all combinations of demands.\n- It checks if any combination sums to \\( K \\) rather than just comparing the total demand.\n- The solution is robust against various input scenarios, including cases where the total demand is less than or greater than \\( K \\).\n\nIn future problem-solving scenarios, I will ensure to consider all possible combinations and subsets when dealing with distribution or partitioning problems, rather than relying solely on summation or direct comparisons."
