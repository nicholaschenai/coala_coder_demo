    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   We need to transform a given integer \\( n \\) into 0 using specific operations. The operations allowed are:\n   - Change the rightmost (0th) bit in the binary representation of \\( n \\).\n   - Change the \\( i \\)th bit in the binary representation of \\( n \\) if the \\( (i-1) \\)th bit is set to 1 and the \\( (i-2) \\)th through 0th bits are set to 0.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**:\n   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. The idea is to keep track of the number of operations needed to reduce \\( n \\) to 0. We can analyze the binary representation of \\( n \\) to determine how many operations are needed based on the positions of the bits that are set to 1. The operations can be counted based on the transitions between the bits in the binary representation.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function minimumOneBitOperations(n):\n       if n == 0:\n           return 0\n       count = 0\n       while n > 0:\n           count += 1\n           n = n & (n - 1)  # This operation removes the lowest set bit\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:\n        # Base case: if n is 0, no operations are needed\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Initialize the count of operations\n        count = 0\n        \n        # While there are bits set in n\n        while n > 0:\n            count += 1  # Increment the operation count\n            n = n & (n - 1)  # Remove the lowest set bit\n        \n        return count  # Return the total count of operations\n```",
