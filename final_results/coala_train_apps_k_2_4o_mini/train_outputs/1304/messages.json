However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, \u2026, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.\nHowever, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, \u2026, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:\n123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \\, 2 \\, 3 \\quad    1 \\, 3 \\, 2 \\quad     2 \\, 1 \\, 3 \\quad     2 \\, 3 \\, 1 \\quad     3 \\, 1 \\, 2 \\quad     3 \\, 2 \\, 1 \nThe problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, \u2026, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.\n\n-----Input:-----\nThe first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,\u2026,N$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nThe output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 1000$.\n- $1 \\leq K \\leq 10$.\n\n-----Sample input-----\n3 2\n3 1 2\n2 3 1\n\n-----Sample output-----\n3 2 1\n3 1 2\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n        has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        None\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n           We need to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function, which sums the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation, equals a given value K. If no such permutation exists, we should return -1.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n           To solve this problem, we need to understand how the function f(P) is calculated. The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is achieved when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the maximum possible sum of adjacent maximums. The minimum value of f(P) is 0, which occurs when N is 1. We can derive the maximum possible value of f(P) as follows:\n           - For N = 1, f(P) = 0.\n           - For N = 2, f(P) = 2.\n           - For N = 3, f(P) = 4.\n           - For N = 4, f(P) = 8.\n           - For N = 5, f(P) = 12.\n           - The pattern shows that the maximum value of f(P) for N is (N-1) * N / 2, which is the sum of the first (N-1) integers.\n   \n           If K is greater than this maximum value or less than the minimum value, we return -1. If K is achievable, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to meet the exact value of K.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n           ```\n           function find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n               for each test_case in test_cases:\n                   N, K = test_case\n                   max_value = (N - 1) * N // 2\n                   if K < 0 or K > max_value:\n                       print -1\n                   else:\n                       create a descending list from N to 1\n                       current_sum = max_value\n                       while current_sum > K:\n                           find the first two adjacent elements in the list\n                           swap them to decrease the current_sum\n                           update current_sum accordingly\n                       print the resulting permutation\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n        ```python\n        def find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for case in test_cases:\n                N, K = case\n                # Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P)\n                max_value = (N - 1) * N // 2\n        \n                # Check if K is out of bounds\n                if K < 0 or K > max_value:\n                    results.append(-1)\n                    continue\n        \n                # Start with the descending permutation\n                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                current_sum = max_value\n        \n                # Adjust the permutation to match K\n                for i in range(N - 1):\n                    if current_sum == K:\n                        break\n                    # Calculate the potential new sum if we swap\n                    new_sum = current_sum - (permutation[i] + permutation[i + 1]) + max(permutation[i + 1], permutation[i])\n                    if new_sum >= K:\n                        # Swap the elements to decrease the sum\n                        permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                        current_sum = new_sum\n        \n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n            # Print all results at once for efficiency\n            print(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)))\n\n        # Read input\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n\n        T = int(data[0])  # Number of test cases\n        test_cases = []\n\n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N, K = map(int, data[i].split())\n            test_cases.append((N, K))\n\n        # Call the function with the parsed input\n        find_permutation(T, test_cases)\n        ```\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n        None\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: ['3', '4 12', '2 2', '5 14'] Expected output: [{'-1'}, {'2', '1'}, {'4', '5', '3', '2', '1'}] # Execution output: ['-1', '-1', '-1']\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Failure\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by removing one character from a given string and reinserting it at any position.

This brute-force approach ensured that all configurations were considered.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the manipulation of strings and understanding of lexicographical order. The solution effectively utilized nested loops: the outer loop for character removal and the inner loop for reinsertion, which allowed for comprehensive exploration of possible outcomes.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases. The key takeaway was the importance of systematically exploring all possible configurations when dealing with string manipulations, especially in problems involving order and arrangement.

        "content": "The official solution effectively implements the algorithm to find the next lexicographic permutation of a sequence. Here are the key insights and steps that stand out:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The official solution uses helper functions to read input efficiently. This modular approach makes the code cleaner and easier to manage.\n\n2. **Finding the Pivot**: The solution iterates through the array in reverse to find the first index `i` where the current element is less than the next element (`arr[i] < arr[i + 1]`). This identifies the point where the permutation can be increased.\n\n3. **Finding the Successor**: Once the pivot is found, the solution looks for the smallest element in the suffix (the part of the array after the pivot) that is larger than `arr[i]`. This is done using a simple loop, which ensures that the next permutation is the smallest possible.\n\n4. **Swapping and Sorting**: After identifying the correct elements to swap, the solution swaps them and then sorts the suffix to ensure it is in the lowest possible order. This guarantees that the next permutation is indeed the next in lexicographic order.\n\n5. **Output**: The results are printed in a single line using unpacking, which is a concise way to format the output.\n\nOverall, the official solution is efficient and straightforward, leveraging a clear understanding of the permutation generation process. It avoids unnecessary complexity by directly manipulating the list and using simple loops, which is effective given the constraints. \n\nIn contrast, my initial solution was similar in approach but could have benefited from clearer input handling and a more structured output format. The official solution's use of helper functions for input reading is a good practice that enhances readability and maintainability."

        "content": "\n[description for function: main]\nThis function reads input data consisting of a number of permutations and processes each permutation to compute its next lexicographical permutation. It first extracts the number of permutations to be processed and then iterates through each permutation, applying a method to find the next permutation. The results are collected in a list and formatted as strings. Finally, it prints all the computed next permutations, each on a new line. The function effectively handles multiple permutations in a single execution.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to generate permutations in a systematic way, particularly in applications involving combinatorial algorithms, game theory, or any situation where the order of elements matters. For example, it can be applied in generating test cases for algorithms, solving puzzles that require next configurations, or in optimization problems where permutations of a set need to be evaluated. Additionally, understanding how to find the next permutation can help in implementing algorithms that require backtracking or iterative improvement."
