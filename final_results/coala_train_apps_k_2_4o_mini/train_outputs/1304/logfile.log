## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.
However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:
123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \, 2 \, 3 \quad    1 \, 3 \, 2 \quad     2 \, 1 \, 3 \quad     2 \, 3 \, 1 \quad     3 \, 1 \, 2 \quad     3 \, 2 \, 1 
The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, â€¦, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$.

-----Output:-----
The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$.
- $1 \leq K \leq 10$.

-----Sample input-----
3 2
3 1 2
2 3 1

-----Sample output-----
3 2 1
3 1 2

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to find the next permutation in lexicographic order for a given list of permutations of numbers from 1 to N. We will be provided with multiple permutations, and for each one, we need to compute and print the next permutation.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the next permutation, we can follow these steps:
   - Identify the longest suffix that is in descending order. This means we need to find the rightmost pair of elements where the first element is less than the second.
   - If such a pair is found, we will swap the first element of this pair with the smallest element in the suffix that is larger than it.
   - Finally, we reverse the suffix to get the next permutation in lexicographic order.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function next_permutation(arr):
       find the largest index i such that arr[i] < arr[i + 1]
       if no such index exists, reverse arr and return
       find the largest index j greater than i such that arr[i] < arr[j]
       swap arr[i] and arr[j]
       reverse the sequence from arr[i + 1] to the end of arr

   for each permutation:
       call next_permutation on the permutation
       print the result
   ```

        i -= 1
    
    # Step 2: If no such index exists, the permutation is the last one
    if i == -1:
        arr.reverse()  # Reverse to get the first permutation
        return arr

It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.

    [Task]:
        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
        You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
        Note f([1]) = 0.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
        - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
        Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

        -----Explanation-----
        Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
        Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
        Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
           We need to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function, which sums the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation, equals a given value K. If no such permutation exists, we should return -1.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
           To solve this problem, we need to understand how the function f(P) is calculated. The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is achieved when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the maximum possible sum of adjacent maximums. The minimum value of f(P) is 0, which occurs when N is 1. We can derive the maximum possible value of f(P) as follows:
           - For N = 1, f(P) = 0.
           - For N = 2, f(P) = 2.
           - For N = 3, f(P) = 4.
           - For N = 4, f(P) = 8.
           - For N = 5, f(P) = 12.
           - The pattern shows that the maximum value of f(P) for N is (N-1) * N / 2, which is the sum of the first (N-1) integers.
   
           If K is greater than this maximum value or less than the minimum value, we return -1. If K is achievable, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to meet the exact value of K.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
           ```
           function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
               for each test_case in test_cases:
                   N, K = test_case
                   max_value = (N - 1) * N // 2
                   if K < 0 or K > max_value:
                       print -1
                   else:
                       create a descending list from N to 1
                       current_sum = max_value
                       while current_sum > K:
                           find the first two adjacent elements in the list
                           swap them to decrease the current_sum
                           update current_sum accordingly
                       print the resulting permutation

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by removing one character from a given string and reinserting it at any position. The solution involved iterating through each character, removing it, and then trying to insert it back into every possible position in the remaining string. This brute-force approach ensured that all configurations were considered.

    The core concept tested here was the manipulation of strings and understanding of lexicographical order. The solution effectively utilized nested loops: the outer loop for character removal and the inner loop for reinsertion, which allowed for comprehensive exploration of possible outcomes.

    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases. The key takeaway was the importance of systematically exploring all possible configurations when dealing with string manipulations, especially in problems involving order and arrangement. The solution was efficient given the constraints, as the maximum string length was 50, making the brute-force approach feasible. 

    The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):
        smallest_string = S  
        for i in range(len(S)):
            char_to_move = S[i]  
            remaining_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]  
            for j in range(len(remaining_string) + 1):
                new_string = remaining_string[:j] + char_to_move + remaining_string[j:]  
                if new_string < smallest_string:
                    smallest_string = new_string

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the next permutation of a given sequence of numbers from 1 to N in lexicographic order. Given multiple permutations, we will output the next permutation for each one.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the next permutation in lexicographic order, we can follow these steps:
   - Identify the longest suffix that is non-increasing (i.e., find the rightmost pair where the first number is less than the second).
   - If such a pair is found, swap the first number of this pair with the smallest number in the suffix that is larger than it.
   - Finally, reverse the suffix to get the next permutation.
   - If no such pair exists, it means we are at the last permutation, and we should return the smallest permutation (sorted order).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function next_permutation(permutation):
       # Step 1: Find the largest index i such that permutation[i] < permutation[i + 1]
       i = length(permutation) - 2
       while i >= 0 and permutation[i] >= permutation[i + 1]:
           i -= 1
       
       if i == -1:

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the next permutation of a given sequence of numbers from 1 to N in lexicographic order. Given multiple permutations, we will output the next permutation for each one.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the next permutation in lexicographic order, we can follow these steps:
   - Identify the longest suffix that is non-increasing (i.e., find the rightmost pair where the first number is less than the second).
   - If such a pair is found, swap the first number of this pair with the smallest number in the suffix that is larger than it.
   - Finally, reverse the suffix to get the next permutation.
   - If no such pair exists, it means we are at the last permutation, and we should return the smallest permutation (sorted order).

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.
However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:
123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \, 2 \, 3 \quad    1 \, 3 \, 2 \quad     2 \, 1 \, 3 \quad     2 \, 3 \, 1 \quad     3 \, 1 \, 2 \quad     3 \, 2 \, 1 
The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, â€¦, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$.

-----Output:-----
The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$.
- $1 \leq K \leq 10$.

-----Sample input-----
3 2
3 1 2
2 3 1

-----Sample output-----
3 2 1
3 1 2

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to find the next permutation of a given sequence of numbers in lexicographic order. The solution involved identifying the longest non-increasing suffix, swapping elements, and reversing the suffix to generate the next permutation. This approach is efficient and works well within the constraints provided.

The core concepts tested included understanding permutations, lexicographic ordering, and implementing algorithms for generating the next permutation. The solution was structured into a main function that reads input and processes multiple permutations, and a helper function that computes the next permutation.

The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the sample input. The key steps in the algorithm were clearly defined, and the code was structured to ensure clarity and maintainability. No unexpected errors occurred during the implementation, and the solution passed all tests, demonstrating its correctness.

Here is the essential code snippet for generating the next permutation:

```python
def next_permutation(permutation):
    i = len(permutation) - 2
    while i >= 0 and permutation[i] >= permutation[i + 1]:
        i -= 1
    
    if i == -1:
        return sorted(permutation)
    
    j = len(permutation) - 1
    while permutation[j] <= permutation[i]:
        j -= 1
    
    permutation[i], permutation[j] = permutation[j], permutation[i]
    permutation[i + 1:] = reversed(permutation[i + 1:])
    
    return permutation
```

This function efficiently computes the next permutation and can be reused in similar problems involving permutations.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] The official solution effectively implements the algorithm to find the next lexicographic permutation of a sequence. Here are the key insights and steps that stand out:

1. **Input Handling**: The official solution uses helper functions to read input efficiently. This modular approach makes the code cleaner and easier to manage.

2. **Finding the Pivot**: The solution iterates through the array in reverse to find the first index `i` where the current element is less than the next element (`arr[i] < arr[i + 1]`). This identifies the point where the permutation can be increased.

3. **Finding the Successor**: Once the pivot is found, the solution looks for the smallest element in the suffix (the part of the array after the pivot) that is larger than `arr[i]`. This is done using a simple loop, which ensures that the next permutation is the smallest possible.

4. **Swapping and Sorting**: After identifying the correct elements to swap, the solution swaps them and then sorts the suffix to ensure it is in the lowest possible order. This guarantees that the next permutation is indeed the next in lexicographic order.

5. **Output**: The results are printed in a single line using unpacking, which is a concise way to format the output.

Overall, the official solution is efficient and straightforward, leveraging a clear understanding of the permutation generation process. It avoids unnecessary complexity by directly manipulating the list and using simple loops, which is effective given the constraints. 

In contrast, my initial solution was similar in approach but could have benefited from clearer input handling and a more structured output format. The official solution's use of helper functions for input reading is a good practice that enhances readability and maintainability.

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] This function reads input data consisting of a number of permutations and processes each permutation to compute its next lexicographical permutation. It first extracts the number of permutations to be processed and then iterates through each permutation, applying a method to find the next permutation. The results are collected in a list and formatted as strings. Finally, it prints all the computed next permutations, each on a new line. The function effectively handles multiple permutations in a single execution.

[Problem]
    It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.
    However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:
    123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \, 2 \, 3 \quad    1 \, 3 \, 2 \quad     2 \, 1 \, 3 \quad     2 \, 3 \, 1 \quad     3 \, 1 \, 2 \quad     3 \, 2 \, 1 
    The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, â€¦, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.

    -----Input:-----
    The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$.

    -----Output:-----
    The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.

    -----Constraints:-----
    - $1 \leq N \leq 1000$.
    - $1 \leq K \leq 10$.

    -----Sample input-----
    3 2
    3 1 2
    2 3 1

    -----Sample output-----
    3 2 1
    3 1 2
