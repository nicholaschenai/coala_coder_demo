    "summary": "In this task, the goal was to find the next permutation of a given sequence of numbers in lexicographic order. The solution involved identifying the longest non-increasing suffix, swapping elements, and reversing the suffix to generate the next permutation. This approach is efficient and works well within the constraints provided.\n\nThe core concepts tested included understanding permutations, lexicographic ordering, and implementing algorithms for generating the next permutation. The solution was structured into a main function that reads input and processes multiple permutations, and a helper function that computes the next permutation.\n\nThe implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the sample input. The key steps in the algorithm were clearly defined, and the code was structured to ensure clarity and maintainability. No unexpected errors occurred during the implementation, and the solution passed all tests, demonstrating its correctness.\n\nHere is the essential code snippet for generating the next permutation:\n\n```python\ndef next_permutation(permutation):\n    i = len(permutation) - 2\n    while i >= 0 and permutation[i] >= permutation[i + 1]:\n        i -= 1\n    \n    if i == -1:\n        return sorted(permutation)\n    \n    j = len(permutation) - 1\n    while permutation[j] <= permutation[i]:\n        j -= 1\n    \n    permutation[i], permutation[j] = permutation[j], permutation[i]\n    permutation[i + 1:] = reversed(permutation[i + 1:])\n    \n    return permutation\n```\n\nThis function efficiently computes the next permutation and can be reused in similar problems involving permutations.",
    "reflection": "The official solution effectively implements the algorithm to find the next lexicographic permutation of a sequence. Here are the key insights and steps that stand out:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The official solution uses helper functions to read input efficiently. This modular approach makes the code cleaner and easier to manage.\n\n2. **Finding the Pivot**: The solution iterates through the array in reverse to find the first index `i` where the current element is less than the next element (`arr[i] < arr[i + 1]`). This identifies the point where the permutation can be increased.\n\n3. **Finding the Successor**: Once the pivot is found, the solution looks for the smallest element in the suffix (the part of the array after the pivot) that is larger than `arr[i]`. This is done using a simple loop, which ensures that the next permutation is the smallest possible.\n\n4. **Swapping and Sorting**: After identifying the correct elements to swap, the solution swaps them and then sorts the suffix to ensure it is in the lowest possible order. This guarantees that the next permutation is indeed the next in lexicographic order.\n\n5. **Output**: The results are printed in a single line using unpacking, which is a concise way to format the output.\n\nOverall, the official solution is efficient and straightforward, leveraging a clear understanding of the permutation generation process. It avoids unnecessary complexity by directly manipulating the list and using simple loops, which is effective given the constraints. \n\nIn contrast, my initial solution was similar in approach but could have benefited from clearer input handling and a more structured output format. The official solution's use of helper functions for input reading is a good practice that enhances readability and maintainability.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThis function reads input data consisting of a number of permutations and processes each permutation to compute its next lexicographical permutation. It first extracts the number of permutations to be processed and then iterates through each permutation, applying a method to find the next permutation. The results are collected in a list and formatted as strings. Finally, it prints all the computed next permutations, each on a new line. The function effectively handles multiple permutations in a single execution.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to generate permutations in a systematic way, particularly in applications involving combinatorial algorithms, game theory, or any situation where the order of elements matters. For example, it can be applied in generating test cases for algorithms, solving puzzles that require next configurations, or in optimization problems where permutations of a set need to be evaluated. Additionally, understanding how to find the next permutation can help in implementing algorithms that require backtracking or iterative improvement."
