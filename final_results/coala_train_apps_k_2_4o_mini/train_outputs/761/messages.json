He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.\nThe good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! \nThe Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.\nPressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.\nPressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.\nChef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?\nBe careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains three integers \u2014 N, K, M \u2014 denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.\n- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, \u2026 , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.\n- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, \u2026 , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.\n- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, \u2026 , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.\n- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, \u2026 , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.\n\n-----Output-----\n- In a single line, output an integer \u2014 the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 4\n- 1 \u2264 N, K, M \u2264 10^5\n- 1 \u2264 Bi \u2264 Ai  \u2264 10^5\n- 1 \u2264 Ci, Di  \u2264 10^5\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask N \u2264 10, K, M \u2264 5.

The goal is to minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally over the given days.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   For each day, we need to determine how many tasks Chef can complete using the buttons.

The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the number of days available to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for summation and list handling.\n\n    The final implementation successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code was structured to first read input values, process each test case, and then output the results. Key strategies included using integer division to determine the number of contests and the `min` function to ensure the result did not exceed the available days. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of clear problem breakdown and efficient use of built-in functions in Python. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n            A = case[3]\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))\n\n    max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which candidate Chef hires for the distribution task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly, while the second candidate places all apples in the box with the least apples. \n\n    The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) is equal to the number of apples (N), both candidates will end up with the same distribution (all apples in one box). However, if K is less than N, the distributions can differ, leading to a \"NO\" answer. The solution involved checking these conditions for each test case.\n\n    The implemented solution was straightforward, iterating through the test cases and applying the logic to determine the output. The final code effectively handled the input and output requirements without any errors. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            if K == N:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        test_cases.append((N, K))\n\n    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and how they influence the solution's logic.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - Chef has planned tasks (A) and completed tasks (B) for several days.\n   - He can use white buttons to reduce planned tasks and black buttons to increase completed tasks.\n   - The goal is to minimize the total uncompleted tasks after all days.\n\n2. **Identifying the Issues:**\n   - The code incorrectly calculates the total uncompleted tasks. The formula used was `total_uncompleted_tasks += (A[day] - B[day])`, which can lead to negative values if more tasks are completed than planned.\n   - The removal of buttons from the lists (C and D) is not handled correctly. Once a button is used, it should not be available for subsequent days, but the current implementation may not correctly track which buttons have been used.\n   - The logic for using buttons does not ensure that we are using the best available button for each day. We should prioritize using the largest available buttons first to maximize the effect.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong:**\n   - The calculation of uncompleted tasks should ensure that it does not go negative. Instead of directly adding the difference, we should ensure that we only add non-negative values.\n   - The button usage logic should be more robust, ensuring that we are using the largest available buttons effectively for both types of buttons.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1.

The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the number of days available to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for summation and list handling.\n\n    The final implementation successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code was structured to first read input values, process each test case, and then output the results. Key strategies included using integer division to determine the number of contests and the `min` function to ensure the result did not exceed the available days.

The key points to consider were whether the total demand from the minions matched \\( K \\), was less than \\( K \\), or exceeded \\( K \\).\n\n    Initially, the approach focused on checking if the total demand equaled \\( K \\) and incorrectly assumed that if the total demand was less than \\( K \\), Gru could always distribute the remaining money. This led to incorrect outputs, particularly in cases where the remaining money could not be distributed without exceeding individual demands.\n\n    The correct logic should have been:\n    1. If the total demand equals \\( K \\), print \"YES\".\n    2. If the total demand is less than \\( K \\), print \"YES\" since Gru can distribute the remaining money.\n    3.

We should be using the largest black button available that can be applied without exceeding the planned tasks for that day.\n   - The same applies to white buttons; we should be using the largest white button available that can be applied without going below zero in planned tasks.\n   - The removal of buttons from the lists (C and D) is not handled correctly. Once a button is used, it should not be available for subsequent days, but the current implementation may not correctly track which buttons have been used.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong:**\n   - The previous implementation did not correctly account for the fact that we should be maximizing the use of buttons in a way that optimally reduces uncompleted tasks.\n   - The calculation of uncompleted tasks was done correctly, but the way buttons were applied was not optimal, leading to incorrect results.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. For each day, first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.\n2.

        "content": "Let's analyze the previous solution step-by-step to identify why it failed to produce the correct output.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements:**\n   - Chef has planned tasks (A) and completed tasks (B) for several days.\n   - He can use white buttons to reduce the planned tasks and black buttons to increase the completed tasks.\n   - The goal is to minimize the total uncompleted tasks after all days.\n\n2. **Identifying the Issues:**\n   - The logic for using black buttons is not optimal. We should be using the largest black button available that can be applied without exceeding the planned tasks for that day.\n   - The same applies to white buttons; we should be using the largest white button available that can be applied without going below zero in planned tasks.\n   - The removal of buttons from the lists (C and D) is not handled correctly. Once a button is used, it should not be available for subsequent days, but the current implementation may not correctly track which buttons have been used.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong:**\n   - The previous implementation did not correctly account for the fact that we should be maximizing the use of buttons in a way that optimally reduces uncompleted tasks.\n   - The calculation of uncompleted tasks was done correctly, but the way buttons were applied was not optimal, leading to incorrect results.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. For each day, first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.\n2. Then, use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks as much as possible.\n3.

The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the number of days available to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for summation and list handling.\n\n    The final implementation successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code was structured to first read input values, process each test case, and then output the results. Key strategies included using integer division to determine the number of contests and the `min` function to ensure the result did not exceed the available days. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of clear problem breakdown and efficient use of built-in functions in Python. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n            A = case[3]\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))\n\n    max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute exactly \\( K \\) amount of money to \\( N \\) minions based on their individual demands. The key points to consider were whether the total demand from the minions matched \\( K \\), was less than \\( K \\), or exceeded \\( K \\).\n\n    Initially, the approach focused on checking if the total demand equaled \\( K \\) and incorrectly assumed that if the total demand was less than \\( K \\), Gru could always distribute the remaining money. This led to incorrect outputs, particularly in cases where the remaining money could not be distributed without exceeding individual demands.\n\n    The correct logic should have been:\n    1. If the total demand equals \\( K \\), print \"YES\".\n    2. If the total demand is less than \\( K \\), print \"YES\" since Gru can distribute the remaining money.\n    3. If the total demand exceeds \\( K \\), print \"NO\".\n\n    Despite multiple attempts to refine the logic, the solution consistently failed to account for the distribution constraints properly. The final code snippet aimed to address these issues but still produced incorrect results, indicating a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.\n\n    ### Key Takeaways:\n    - Ensure to fully understand the constraints of distribution when dealing with remaining amounts.\n    - Always validate the logic against edge cases to ensure correctness.\n    - The problem highlighted the importance of careful condition checking in scenarios involving sums and distributions. \n\n    ### Final Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            K = case[1]\n            demands = case[2]\n            total_demand = sum(demands)\n        \n            if total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            elif total_demand < K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        demands = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, demands))\n\n    can_distribute_money(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the core concepts, strategies attempted, and the errors encountered during the problem-solving process.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
