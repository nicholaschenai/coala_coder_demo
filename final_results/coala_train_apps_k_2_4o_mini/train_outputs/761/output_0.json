    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   Chef has a number of tasks planned over several days, but he can use buttons from a Time Machine to adjust the number of tasks he has to complete. There are two types of buttons: white buttons that can reduce the planned tasks and black buttons that can increase the completed tasks. The goal is to determine the minimum number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally over all days.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - For each day, we need to decide whether to use a white button to reduce the planned tasks or a black button to increase the completed tasks.\n   - We will sort the white buttons in descending order to maximize the reduction of planned tasks and the black buttons in descending order to maximize the increase in completed tasks.\n   - For each day, we will first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks. Then, we will use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks.\n   - Finally, we will calculate the total uncompleted tasks after processing all days.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read N, K, M\n           read planned_tasks A\n           read completed_tasks B\n           read white_buttons C\n           read black_buttons D\n           \n           sort C in descending order\n           sort D in descending order\n           \n           total_uncompleted_tasks = 0\n           \n           for day from 0 to N-1:\n               # Use black buttons first\n               for each black_button in D:\n                   if B[day] + black_button <= A[day]:\n                       B[day] += black_button\n                       remove black_button from D\n                       break\n               \n               # Use white buttons next\n               for each white_button in C:\n                   if A[day] >= white_button:\n                       A[day] -= white_button\n                       remove white_button from C\n                       break\n               \n               # Calculate uncompleted tasks for the day\n               total_uncompleted_tasks += (A[day] - B[day])\n           \n           print total_uncompleted_tasks\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):\n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Read the number of days, white buttons, and black buttons\n        N, K, M = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n        # Read planned tasks and completed tasks\n        A = case[3]\n        B = case[4]\n        # Read white buttons and black buttons\n        C = case[5]\n        D = case[6]\n        \n        # Sort white and black buttons in descending order\n        C.sort(reverse=True)\n        D.sort(reverse=True)\n        \n        total_uncompleted_tasks = 0\n        \n        for day in range(N):\n            # Use black buttons first to increase completed tasks\n            for black_button in D:\n                if B[day] + black_button <= A[day]:\n                    B[day] += black_button\n                    D.remove(black_button)  # Remove the used button\n                    break\n            \n            # Use white buttons next to reduce planned tasks\n            for white_button in C:\n                if A[day] >= white_button:\n                    A[day] -= white_button\n                    C.remove(white_button)  # Remove the used button\n                    break\n            \n            # Calculate uncompleted tasks for the day\n            total_uncompleted_tasks += (A[day] - B[day])\n        \n        # Output the total uncompleted tasks\n        print(total_uncompleted_tasks)\n\n# Read input values\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N, K, M = map(int, input().split())\n    A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    B = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    C = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    D = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    test_cases.append((N, K, M, A, B, C, D))\n\n# Call the function with the test cases\nmin_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)\n```",
