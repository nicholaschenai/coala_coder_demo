Then it uses the largest white button to reduce the planned tasks.\n4. **Uncompleted Tasks Calculation:** After processing each day, it calculates the uncompleted tasks and ensures that it does not go negative.\n5. **Output:** Finally, it prints the total uncompleted tasks for each test case.\n\nThis code should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks for the given test cases.",
