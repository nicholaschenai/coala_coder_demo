## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 761 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef has a number of days where he has planned tasks to complete, but he has only managed to finish a certain number of those tasks. He has access to a Time Machine with buttons that can either reduce the number of planned tasks or increase the number of completed tasks. The goal is to minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally over the given days.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   For each day, we need to determine how many tasks Chef can complete using the buttons. We will:
   - Use black buttons to increase the number of completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.
   - Use white buttons to reduce the planned tasks as much as possible without going below zero.
   - After processing all days, we will calculate the total uncompleted tasks by subtracting the completed tasks from the planned tasks for each day.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, K, M
           read planned_tasks A
           read completed_tasks B
           read white_buttons C
           read black_buttons D
           
           sort C in descending order
           sort D in descending order
           
           for each day from 0 to N-1:
               use black buttons to increase completed tasks
               for each button in D:
                   if B[day] + button <= A[day]:
                       B[day] += button
                       mark button as used
                       break
               
               use white buttons to reduce planned tasks
               for each button in C:
                   if A[day] >= button:
                       A[day] -= button
                       mark button as used
                       break
           
           total_uncompleted = sum(A[i] - B[i] for i in range(N))
           print total_uncompleted
   ```

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host given the number of problems created by his setters, the number of problems required for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the number of days available to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for summation and list handling.

    The final implementation successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code was structured to first read input values, process each test case, and then output the results. Key strategies included using integer division to determine the number of contests and the `min` function to ensure the result did not exceed the available days. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of clear problem breakdown and efficient use of built-in functions in Python. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]
            A = case[3]
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))

    max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases)
    ```
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which candidate Chef hires for the distribution task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly, while the second candidate places all apples in the box with the least apples. 

    The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) is equal to the number of apples (N), both candidates will end up with the same distribution (all apples in one box). However, if K is less than N, the distributions can differ, leading to a "NO" answer. The solution involved checking these conditions for each test case.

    The implemented solution was straightforward, iterating through the test cases and applying the logic to determine the output. The final code effectively handled the input and output requirements without any errors. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case
            if K == N:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        test_cases.append((N, K))

    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and how they influence the solution's logic.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 761 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef has a number of tasks planned over several days, but he can use buttons from a Time Machine to adjust the number of tasks he has to complete. There are two types of buttons: white buttons that can reduce the planned tasks and black buttons that can increase the completed tasks. The goal is to determine the minimum number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally over all days.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each day, we need to decide whether to use a white button to reduce the planned tasks or a black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - We will sort the white buttons in descending order to maximize the reduction of planned tasks and the black buttons in descending order to maximize the increase in completed tasks.
   - For each day, we will first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks. Then, we will use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks.
   - Finally, we will calculate the total uncompleted tasks after processing all days.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, K, M
           read planned_tasks A
           read completed_tasks B
           read white_buttons C
           read black_buttons D
           
           sort C in descending order
           sort D in descending order
           
           total_uncompleted_tasks = 0
           
           for day from 0 to N-1:
               # Use black buttons first
               for each black_button in D:
                   if B[day] + black_button <= A[day]:
                       B[day] += black_button
                       remove black_button from D
                       break
               
               # Use white buttons next
               for each white_button in C:
                   if A[day] >= white_button:
                       A[day] -= white_button
                       remove white_button from C

               # Calculate uncompleted tasks for the day
               total_uncompleted_tasks += (A[day] - B[day])

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef has a number of tasks planned over several days, but he can use buttons from a Time Machine to adjust the number of tasks he has to complete. There are two types of buttons: white buttons that can reduce the planned tasks and black buttons that can increase the completed tasks. The goal is to determine the minimum number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally over all days.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each day, we need to decide whether to use a white button to reduce the planned tasks or a black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - We will sort the white buttons in descending order to maximize the reduction of planned tasks and the black buttons in descending order to maximize the increase in completed tasks.
   - For each day, we will first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks. Then, we will use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks.
   - Finally, we will calculate the total uncompleted tasks after processing all days.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Chef has planned tasks (A) and completed tasks (B) for several days.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce planned tasks and black buttons to increase completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the total uncompleted tasks after all days.

2. **Identifying the Issues:**
   - The code incorrectly calculates the total uncompleted tasks. The formula used was `total_uncompleted_tasks += (A[day] - B[day])`, which can lead to negative values if more tasks are completed than planned.
   - The removal of buttons from the lists (C and D) is not handled correctly. Once a button is used, it should not be available for subsequent days, but the current implementation may not correctly track which buttons have been used.
   - The logic for using buttons does not ensure that we are using the best available button for each day. We should prioritize using the largest available buttons first to maximize the effect.

3. **Where I Went Wrong:**
   - The calculation of uncompleted tasks should ensure that it does not go negative. Instead of directly adding the difference, we should ensure that we only add non-negative values.
   - The button usage logic should be more robust, ensuring that we are using the largest available buttons effectively for both types of buttons.

### Revised Approach:
1. For each day, first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.
2. Then, use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks as much as possible.
3. Finally, calculate the total uncompleted tasks ensuring that it does not go negative.

### Revised Pseudocode:
```
function min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N, K, M
        read planned_tasks A

        read white_buttons C
        read black_buttons D
        
        sort C in descending order
        sort D in descending order
        
        total_uncompleted_tasks = 0

                if B[day] + black_button <= A[day]:
                    B[day] += black_button
                    remove black_button from D
                    break

    C = list(map(int, input().split()))
    D = list(map(int, input().split()))
    test_cases.append((N, K, M, A, B, C, D))

# Call the function with the test cases

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution

- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef has a number of tasks planned over several days, but he can use buttons from a Time Machine to adjust the number of tasks he has to complete. There are two types of buttons: white buttons that can reduce the planned tasks and black buttons that can increase the completed tasks. The goal is to determine the minimum number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally over all days.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each day, we need to decide whether to use a white button to reduce the planned tasks or a black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - We will sort the white buttons in descending order to maximize the reduction of planned tasks and the black buttons in descending order to maximize the increase in completed tasks.
   - For each day, we will first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks. Then, we will use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks.
   - Finally, we will calculate the total uncompleted tasks after processing all days.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Chef has planned tasks (A) and completed tasks (B) for several days.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce planned tasks and black buttons to increase completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the total uncompleted tasks after all days.

2. **Identifying the Issues:**
   - The code incorrectly calculates the total uncompleted tasks. The formula used was `total_uncompleted_tasks += (A[day] - B[day])`, which can lead to negative values if more tasks are completed than planned.
   - The removal of buttons from the lists (C and D) is not handled correctly. Once a button is used, it should not be available for subsequent days, but the current implementation may not correctly track which buttons have been used.
   - The logic for using buttons does not ensure that we are using the best available button for each day. We should prioritize using the largest available buttons first to maximize the effect.

3. **Where I Went Wrong:**
   - The calculation of uncompleted tasks should ensure that it does not go negative. Instead of directly adding the difference, we should ensure that we only add non-negative values.
   - The button usage logic should be more robust, ensuring that we are using the largest available buttons effectively for both types of buttons.

### Revised Approach:
1. For each day, first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.
2. Then, use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks as much as possible.
3. Finally, calculate the total uncompleted tasks ensuring that it does not go negative.

### Revised Pseudocode:
```
function min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N, K, M

        read white_buttons C
        read black_buttons D
        
        sort C in descending order
        sort D in descending order
        
        total_uncompleted_tasks = 0

            for black_button in D:
                if B[day] + black_button <= A[day]:
                    B[day] += black_button
                    remove black_button from D
                    break
            
            # Use white buttons next
            for white_button in C:
                if A[day] >= white_button:
                    A[day] -= white_button
                    remove white_button from C
                    break
            
            # Calculate uncompleted tasks for the day
            uncompleted_today = max(0, A[day] - B[day])
            total_uncompleted_tasks += uncompleted_today
        
        print total_uncompleted_tasks
```

### Revised Python Code:

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host given the number of problems created by his setters, the number of problems required for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the number of days available to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for summation and list handling.

    The final implementation successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code was structured to first read input values, process each test case, and then output the results. Key strategies included using integer division to determine the number of contests and the `min` function to ensure the result did not exceed the available days. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of clear problem breakdown and efficient use of built-in functions in Python. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]

[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute exactly \( K \) amount of money to \( N \) minions based on their individual demands. The key points to consider were whether the total demand from the minions matched \( K \), was less than \( K \), or exceeded \( K \).

    Initially, the approach focused on checking if the total demand equaled \( K \) and incorrectly assumed that if the total demand was less than \( K \), Gru could always distribute the remaining money. This led to incorrect outputs, particularly in cases where the remaining money could not be distributed without exceeding individual demands.

    The correct logic should have been:
    1. If the total demand equals \( K \), print "YES".
    2. If the total demand is less than \( K \), print "YES" since Gru can distribute the remaining money.
    3. If the total demand exceeds \( K \), print "NO".

    Despite multiple attempts to refine the logic, the solution consistently failed to account for the distribution constraints properly. The final code snippet aimed to address these issues but still produced incorrect results, indicating a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.

    ### Key Takeaways:
    - Ensure to fully understand the constraints of distribution when dealing with remaining amounts.
    - Always validate the logic against edge cases to ensure correctness.
    - The problem highlighted the importance of careful condition checking in scenarios involving sums and distributions. 

    ### Final Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            K = case[1]
            demands = case[2]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
        
            if total_demand == K:
                print("YES")
            elif total_demand < K:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

2. **Button Usage Logic:** The logic for using black and white buttons has been retained, ensuring that we maximize the effect of each button used.
3. **Input Handling:** The input handling remains the same, ensuring that we read the test cases correctly.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] 
## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef has a number of tasks planned over several days, but he can use buttons from a Time Machine to adjust the number of tasks he has to complete. There are two types of buttons: white buttons that can reduce the planned tasks and black buttons that can increase the completed tasks. The goal is to determine the minimum number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally over all days.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each day, we need to decide whether to use a white button to reduce the planned tasks or a black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - We will sort the white buttons in descending order to maximize the reduction of planned tasks and the black buttons in descending order to maximize the increase in completed tasks.
   - For each day, we will first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks. Then, we will use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks.
   - Finally, we will calculate the total uncompleted tasks after processing all days.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, K, M
           read planned_tasks A
           read completed_tasks B
           read white_buttons C
           read black_buttons D
           
           sort C in descending order
           sort D in descending order
           
           total_uncompleted_tasks = 0

                       remove black_button from D
                       break
               
               # Use white buttons next
               for each white_button in C:
                   if A[day] >= white_button:
                       A[day] -= white_button
                       remove white_button from C

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Chef has planned tasks (A) and completed tasks (B) for several days.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce planned tasks and black buttons to increase completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the total uncompleted tasks after all days.

2. **Identifying the Issues:**
   - The code incorrectly calculates the total uncompleted tasks. The formula used was `total_uncompleted_tasks += (A[day] - B[day])`, which can lead to negative values if more tasks are completed than planned.
   - The removal of buttons from the lists (C and D) is not handled correctly. Once a button is used, it should not be available for subsequent days, but the current implementation may not correctly track which buttons have been used.
   - The logic for using buttons does not ensure that we are using the best available button for each day. We should prioritize using the largest available buttons first to maximize the effect.

3. **Where I Went Wrong:**
   - The calculation of uncompleted tasks should ensure that it does not go negative. Instead of directly adding the difference, we should ensure that we only add non-negative values.
   - The button usage logic should be more robust, ensuring that we are using the largest available buttons effectively for both types of buttons.

### Revised Approach:
1. For each day, first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.
2. Then, use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks as much as possible.
3. Finally, calculate the total uncompleted tasks ensuring that it does not go negative.

### Revised Pseudocode:
```
function min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N, K, M
        read planned_tasks A
        read completed_tasks B
        read white_buttons C
        read black_buttons D
        
        sort C in descending order
        sort D in descending order
        
        total_uncompleted_tasks = 0
        
        for day from 0 to N-1:
            # Use black buttons first
            for black_button in D:
                if B[day] + black_button <= A[day]:
                    B[day] += black_button
                    remove black_button from D
                    break
            
            # Use white buttons next
            for white_button in C:
                if A[day] >= white_button:
                    A[day] -= white_button
                    remove white_button from C
                    break
            
            # Calculate uncompleted tasks for the day
            uncompleted_today = max(0, A[day] - B[day])
            total_uncompleted_tasks += uncompleted_today
        
        print total_uncompleted_tasks
```

### Revised Python Code:

```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Correct Calculation of Uncompleted Tasks:** The calculation of uncompleted tasks now uses `max(0, A[day] - B[day])` to ensure that we do not add negative values to the total.
2. **Button Usage Logic:** The logic for using black and white buttons has been retained, ensuring that we maximize the effect of each button used.
3. **Input Handling:** The input handling remains the same, ensuring that we read the test cases correctly.

This code should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks for the given test cases.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [generation text] Let's analyze the issues in the previous solution step-by-step to identify why it failed to produce the correct output.

1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements:**
   - Chef has planned tasks (A) and completed tasks (B) for several days.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce the planned tasks and black buttons to increase the completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the total uncompleted tasks after all days.

2. **Identifying the Issues:**
   - The logic for using black buttons is not optimal. We should be using the largest black button available that can be applied without exceeding the planned tasks for that day.
   - The same applies to white buttons; we should be using the largest white button available that can be applied without going below zero in planned tasks.
   - The removal of buttons from the lists (C and D) is not handled correctly. Once a button is used, it should not be available for subsequent days, but the current implementation may not correctly track which buttons have been used.

3. **Where I Went Wrong:**
   - The previous implementation did not correctly account for the fact that we should be maximizing the use of buttons in a way that optimally reduces uncompleted tasks.
   - The calculation of uncompleted tasks was done correctly, but the way buttons were applied was not optimal, leading to incorrect results.

### Revised Approach:
1. For each day, first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.
2. Then, use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks as much as possible.
3. Finally, calculate the total uncompleted tasks ensuring that it does not go negative.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

   Chef has a number of tasks planned over several days, but he can use buttons from a Time Machine to adjust the number of tasks he has to complete. There are two types of buttons: white buttons that can reduce the planned tasks and black buttons that can increase the completed tasks. The goal is to determine the minimum number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally over all days.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each day, we need to decide whether to use a white button to reduce the planned tasks or a black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - We will sort the white buttons in descending order to maximize the reduction of planned tasks and the black buttons in descending order to maximize the increase in completed tasks.
   - For each day, we will first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks. Then, we will use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks.
   - Finally, we will calculate the total uncompleted tasks after processing all days.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, K, M
           read planned_tasks A
           read completed_tasks B
           read white_buttons C
           read black_buttons D
           
           sort C in descending order
           sort D in descending order
           
           total_uncompleted_tasks = 0
           
           for day from 0 to N-1:
               # Use black buttons first
               for each black_button in D:
                   if B[day] + black_button <= A[day]:
                       B[day] += black_button
                       remove black_button from D
                       break
               
               # Use white buttons next
               for each white_button in C:
                   if A[day] >= white_button:
                       A[day] -= white_button
                       remove white_button from C
                       break
               
               # Calculate uncompleted tasks for the day
               total_uncompleted_tasks += (A[day] - B[day])
           
           print total_uncompleted_tasks

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Chef has planned tasks (A) and completed tasks (B) for several days.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce planned tasks and black buttons to increase completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the total uncompleted tasks after all days.

2. **Identifying the Issues:**
   - The code incorrectly calculates the total uncompleted tasks. The formula used was `total_uncompleted_tasks += (A[day] - B[day])`, which can lead to negative values if more tasks are completed than planned.
   - The removal of buttons from the lists (C and D) is not handled correctly. Once a button is used, it should not be available for subsequent days, but the current implementation may not correctly track which buttons have been used.
   - The logic for using buttons does not ensure that we are using the best available button for each day. We should prioritize using the largest available buttons first to maximize the effect.

3. **Where I Went Wrong:**
   - The calculation of uncompleted tasks should ensure that it does not go negative. Instead of directly adding the difference, we should ensure that we only add non-negative values.
   - The button usage logic should be more robust, ensuring that we are using the largest available buttons effectively for both types of buttons.

### Revised Approach:
1. For each day, first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.
2. Then, use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks as much as possible.
3. Finally, calculate the total uncompleted tasks ensuring that it does not go negative.

### Revised Pseudocode:

            total_uncompleted_tasks += uncompleted_today

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Correct Calculation of Uncompleted Tasks:** The calculation of uncompleted tasks now uses `max(0, A[day] - B[day])` to ensure that we do not add negative values to the total.
2. **Button Usage Logic:** The logic for using black and white buttons has been retained, ensuring that we maximize the effect of each button used.
3. **Input Handling:** The input handling remains the same, ensuring that we read the test cases correctly.

This code should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks for the given test cases.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues in the previous solution step-by-step to identify why it failed to produce the correct output.

1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements:**
   - Chef has planned tasks (A) and completed tasks (B) for several days.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce the planned tasks and black buttons to increase the completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the total uncompleted tasks after all days.

2. **Identifying the Issues:**
   - The logic for using black buttons is not optimal. We should be using the largest black button available that can be applied without exceeding the planned tasks for that day.
   - The same applies to white buttons; we should be using the largest white button available that can be applied without going below zero in planned tasks.
   - The removal of buttons from the lists (C and D) is not handled correctly. Once a button is used, it should not be available for subsequent days, but the current implementation may not correctly track which buttons have been used.

3. **Where I Went Wrong:**
   - The previous implementation did not correctly account for the fact that we should be maximizing the use of buttons in a way that optimally reduces uncompleted tasks.
   - The calculation of uncompleted tasks was done correctly, but the way buttons were applied was not optimal, leading to incorrect results.

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host given the number of problems created by his setters, the number of problems required for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the number of days available to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for summation and list handling.

    The final implementation successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code was structured to first read input values, process each test case, and then output the results. Key strategies included using integer division to determine the number of contests and the `min` function to ensure the result did not exceed the available days. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of clear problem breakdown and efficient use of built-in functions in Python. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]
            A = case[3]
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute exactly \( K \) amount of money to \( N \) minions based on their individual demands. The key points to consider were whether the total demand from the minions matched \( K \), was less than \( K \), or exceeded \( K \).

    Initially, the approach focused on checking if the total demand equaled \( K \) and incorrectly assumed that if the total demand was less than \( K \), Gru could always distribute the remaining money. This led to incorrect outputs, particularly in cases where the remaining money could not be distributed without exceeding individual demands.

    The correct logic should have been:
    1. If the total demand equals \( K \), print "YES".
    2. If the total demand is less than \( K \), print "YES" since Gru can distribute the remaining money.
    3. If the total demand exceeds \( K \), print "NO".

    Despite multiple attempts to refine the logic, the solution consistently failed to account for the distribution constraints properly. The final code snippet aimed to address these issues but still produced incorrect results, indicating a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.

    ### Key Takeaways:
    - Ensure to fully understand the constraints of distribution when dealing with remaining amounts.
    - Always validate the logic against edge cases to ensure correctness.
    - The problem highlighted the importance of careful condition checking in scenarios involving sums and distributions. 

    ### Final Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            K = case[1]
            demands = case[2]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
        
            if total_demand == K:
                print("YES")
            elif total_demand < K:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):

INFO - [Task id] 761 [generation text] Based on the insights gained from the previous attempts and the understanding of the problem, I will revise the solution to ensure it correctly calculates the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally.

### Key Points to Address:
1. **Button Usage Logic:** We need to ensure that we are using the largest available black button first to increase completed tasks and the largest available white button to reduce planned tasks.
2. **Correct Calculation of Uncompleted Tasks:** We need to ensure that the calculation of uncompleted tasks does not go negative and is done correctly after processing each day.

### Revised Python Code:
```python
def min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        # Read the number of days, white buttons, and black buttons
        N, K, M = case[0], case[1], case[2]
        # Read planned tasks and completed tasks
        A = case[3]
        B = case[4]
        # Read white buttons and black buttons
        C = case[5]
        D = case[6]
        
        # Sort white and black buttons in descending order
        C.sort(reverse=True)
        D.sort(reverse=True)
        
        total_uncompleted_tasks = 0
        
        for day in range(N):
            # Use black buttons first to increase completed tasks
            for black_button in D:
                if B[day] + black_button <= A[day]:
                    B[day] += black_button
                    D.remove(black_button)  # Remove the used button
                    break
            
            # Use white buttons next to reduce planned tasks
            for white_button in C:
                if A[day] >= white_button:
                    A[day] -= white_button
                    C.remove(white_button)  # Remove the used button
                    break
            
            # Calculate uncompleted tasks for the day
            uncompleted_today = max(0, A[day] - B[day])  # Ensure non-negative
            total_uncompleted_tasks += uncompleted_today
        
        # Output the total uncompleted tasks
        print(total_uncompleted_tasks)

# Read input values
T = int(input())
test_cases = []

    N, K, M = map(int, input().split())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    C = list(map(int, input().split()))
    D = list(map(int, input().split()))
    test_cases.append((N, K, M, A, B, C, D))

# Call the function with the test cases
min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling:** The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of days, the number of white and black buttons, the planned tasks, completed tasks, and the values on the buttons.
2. **Sorting:** The white and black buttons are sorted in descending order to maximize their effectiveness when used.
3. **Button Usage:** For each day, the code attempts to use the largest black button first to increase the completed tasks without exceeding the planned tasks. Then it uses the largest white button to reduce the planned tasks.
4. **Uncompleted Tasks Calculation:** After processing each day, it calculates the uncompleted tasks and ensures that it does not go negative.
5. **Output:** Finally, it prints the total uncompleted tasks for each test case.

This code should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks for the given test cases.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef has a number of tasks planned over several days, but he can use buttons from a Time Machine to adjust the number of tasks he has to complete. There are two types of buttons: white buttons that can reduce the planned tasks and black buttons that can increase the completed tasks. The goal is to determine the minimum number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally over all days.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each day, we need to decide whether to use a white button to reduce the planned tasks or a black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - We will sort the white buttons in descending order to maximize the reduction of planned tasks and the black buttons in descending order to maximize the increase in completed tasks.
   - For each day, we will first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks. Then, we will use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks.
   - Finally, we will calculate the total uncompleted tasks after processing all days.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, K, M
           read planned_tasks A
           read completed_tasks B
           read white_buttons C
           read black_buttons D
           
           sort C in descending order
           sort D in descending order
           
           total_uncompleted_tasks = 0

                       B[day] += black_button
                       remove black_button from D
                       break
               
               # Use white buttons next
               for each white_button in C:
                   if A[day] >= white_button:
                       A[day] -= white_button
                       remove white_button from C
                       break
               
               # Calculate uncompleted tasks for the day
               total_uncompleted_tasks += (A[day] - B[day])
           
           print total_uncompleted_tasks

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Chef has planned tasks (A) and completed tasks (B) for several days.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce planned tasks and black buttons to increase completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the total uncompleted tasks after all days.

2. **Identifying the Issues:**
   - The code incorrectly calculates the total uncompleted tasks. The formula used was `total_uncompleted_tasks += (A[day] - B[day])`, which can lead to negative values if more tasks are completed than planned.
   - The removal of buttons from the lists (C and D) is not handled correctly. Once a button is used, it should not be available for subsequent days, but the current implementation may not correctly track which buttons have been used.
   - The logic for using buttons does not ensure that we are using the best available button for each day. We should prioritize using the largest available buttons first to maximize the effect.

3. **Where I Went Wrong:**
   - The calculation of uncompleted tasks should ensure that it does not go negative. Instead of directly adding the difference, we should ensure that we only add non-negative values.
   - The button usage logic should be more robust, ensuring that we are using the largest available buttons effectively for both types of buttons.

### Revised Approach:
1. For each day, first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.
2. Then, use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks as much as possible.
3. Finally, calculate the total uncompleted tasks ensuring that it does not go negative.

### Revised Pseudocode:
```
function min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N, K, M
        read planned_tasks A

        read black_buttons D

                if B[day] + black_button <= A[day]:
                    B[day] += black_button
                    remove black_button from D

            total_uncompleted_tasks += uncompleted_today

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Correct Calculation of Uncompleted Tasks:** The calculation of uncompleted tasks now uses `max(0, A[day] - B[day])` to ensure that we do not add negative values to the total.
2. **Button Usage Logic:** The logic for using black and white buttons has been retained, ensuring that we maximize the effect of each button used.
3. **Input Handling:** The input handling remains the same, ensuring that we read the test cases correctly.

This code should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks for the given test cases.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues in the previous solution step-by-step to identify why it failed to produce the correct output.

1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements:**
   - Chef has planned tasks (A) and completed tasks (B) for several days.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce the planned tasks and black buttons to increase the completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the total uncompleted tasks after all days.

2. **Identifying the Issues:**
   - The logic for using black buttons is not optimal. We should be using the largest black button available that can be applied without exceeding the planned tasks for that day.
   - The same applies to white buttons; we should be using the largest white button available that can be applied without going below zero in planned tasks.

3. **Where I Went Wrong:**
   - The previous implementation did not correctly account for the fact that we should be maximizing the use of buttons in a way that optimally reduces uncompleted tasks.
   - The calculation of uncompleted tasks was done correctly, but the way buttons were applied was not optimal, leading to incorrect results.

### Key Points to Address:
1. **Button Usage Logic:** We need to ensure that we are using the largest available black button first to increase completed tasks and the largest available white button to reduce planned tasks.
2. **Correct Calculation of Uncompleted Tasks:** We need to ensure that the calculation of uncompleted tasks does not go negative and is done correctly after processing each day.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling:** The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of days, the number of white and black buttons, the planned tasks, completed tasks, and the values on the buttons.
2. **Sorting:** The white and black buttons are sorted in descending order to maximize their effectiveness when used.
3. **Button Usage:** For each day, the code attempts to use the largest black button first to increase the completed tasks without exceeding the planned tasks. Then it uses the largest white button to reduce the planned tasks.
4. **Uncompleted Tasks Calculation:** After processing each day, it calculates the uncompleted tasks and ensures that it does not go negative.
5. **Output:** Finally, it prints the total uncompleted tasks for each test case.

This code should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks for the given test cases.

    test_cases.append((N, K, M, A, B, C, D))

# Call the function with the test cases
min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling:** The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of days, the number of white and black buttons, the planned tasks, completed tasks, and the values on the buttons.
2. **Sorting:** The white and black buttons are sorted in descending order to maximize their effectiveness when used.
3. **Button Usage:** For each day, the code attempts to use the largest black button first to increase the completed tasks without exceeding the planned tasks. Then it uses the largest white button to reduce the planned tasks.
4. **Uncompleted Tasks Calculation:** After processing each day, it calculates the uncompleted tasks and ensures that it does not go negative.
5. **Output:** Finally, it prints the total uncompleted tasks for each test case.

This code should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks for the given test cases.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef has a number of tasks planned over several days, but he can use buttons from a Time Machine to adjust the number of tasks he has to complete. There are two types of buttons: white buttons that can reduce the planned tasks and black buttons that can increase the completed tasks. The goal is to determine the minimum number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally over all days.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each day, we need to decide whether to use a white button to reduce the planned tasks or a black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - We will sort the white buttons in descending order to maximize the reduction of planned tasks and the black buttons in descending order to maximize the increase in completed tasks.
   - For each day, we will first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks. Then, we will use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks.
   - Finally, we will calculate the total uncompleted tasks after processing all days.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Chef has planned tasks (A) and completed tasks (B) for several days.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce planned tasks and black buttons to increase completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the total uncompleted tasks after all days.

2. **Identifying the Issues:**
   - The code incorrectly calculates the total uncompleted tasks. The formula used was `total_uncompleted_tasks += (A[day] - B[day])`, which can lead to negative values if more tasks are completed than planned.
   - The removal of buttons from the lists (C and D) is not handled correctly. Once a button is used, it should not be available for subsequent days, but the current implementation may not correctly track which buttons have been used.
   - The logic for using buttons does not ensure that we are using the best available button for each day. We should prioritize using the largest available buttons first to maximize the effect.

3. **Where I Went Wrong:**
   - The calculation of uncompleted tasks should ensure that it does not go negative. Instead of directly adding the difference, we should ensure that we only add non-negative values.
   - The button usage logic should be more robust, ensuring that we are using the largest available buttons effectively for both types of buttons.

### Revised Approach:
1. For each day, first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.
2. Then, use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks as much as possible.
3. Finally, calculate the total uncompleted tasks ensuring that it does not go negative.

### Revised Pseudocode:
```

        read black_buttons D
        
        sort C in descending order
        sort D in descending order

                if B[day] + black_button <= A[day]:
                    B[day] += black_button
                    remove black_button from D
                    break

            total_uncompleted_tasks += uncompleted_today
        
        print total_uncompleted_tasks
```

    test_cases.append((N, K, M, A, B, C, D))

# Call the function with the test cases
min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Correct Calculation of Uncompleted Tasks:** The calculation of uncompleted tasks now uses `max(0, A[day] - B[day])` to ensure that we do not add negative values to the total.
2. **Button Usage Logic:** The logic for using black and white buttons has been retained, ensuring that we maximize the effect of each button used.
3. **Input Handling:** The input handling remains the same, ensuring that we read the test cases correctly.

This code should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks for the given test cases.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues in the previous solution step-by-step to identify why it failed to produce the correct output.

1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements:**
   - Chef has planned tasks (A) and completed tasks (B) for several days.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce the planned tasks and black buttons to increase the completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the total uncompleted tasks after all days.

2. **Identifying the Issues:**
   - The logic for using black buttons is not optimal. We should be using the largest black button available that can be applied without exceeding the planned tasks for that day.
   - The same applies to white buttons; we should be using the largest white button available that can be applied without going below zero in planned tasks.
   - The removal of buttons from the lists (C and D) is not handled correctly. Once a button is used, it should not be available for subsequent days, but the current implementation may not correctly track which buttons have been used.

3. **Where I Went Wrong:**
   - The previous implementation did not correctly account for the fact that we should be maximizing the use of buttons in a way that optimally reduces uncompleted tasks.
   - The calculation of uncompleted tasks was done correctly, but the way buttons were applied was not optimal, leading to incorrect results.

### Revised Approach:
1. For each day, first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.
2. Then, use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks as much as possible.
3. Finally, calculate the total uncompleted tasks ensuring that it does not go negative.

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host given the number of problems created by his setters, the number of problems required for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the number of days available to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for summation and list handling.

    The final implementation successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code was structured to first read input values, process each test case, and then output the results. Key strategies included using integer division to determine the number of contests and the `min` function to ensure the result did not exceed the available days. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of clear problem breakdown and efficient use of built-in functions in Python. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]
            A = case[3]
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute exactly \( K \) amount of money to \( N \) minions based on their individual demands. The key points to consider were whether the total demand from the minions matched \( K \), was less than \( K \), or exceeded \( K \).

    Initially, the approach focused on checking if the total demand equaled \( K \) and incorrectly assumed that if the total demand was less than \( K \), Gru could always distribute the remaining money. This led to incorrect outputs, particularly in cases where the remaining money could not be distributed without exceeding individual demands.

    The correct logic should have been:
    1. If the total demand equals \( K \), print "YES".
    2. If the total demand is less than \( K \), print "YES" since Gru can distribute the remaining money.
    3. If the total demand exceeds \( K \), print "NO".

    Despite multiple attempts to refine the logic, the solution consistently failed to account for the distribution constraints properly. The final code snippet aimed to address these issues but still produced incorrect results, indicating a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.

    ### Key Takeaways:
    - Ensure to fully understand the constraints of distribution when dealing with remaining amounts.
    - Always validate the logic against edge cases to ensure correctness.
    - The problem highlighted the importance of careful condition checking in scenarios involving sums and distributions. 

    ### Final Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            K = case[1]
            demands = case[2]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
        
            if total_demand == K:
                print("YES")
            elif total_demand < K:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    test_cases.append((N, K, M, A, B, C, D))

# Call the function with the test cases
min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling:** The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of days, the number of white and black buttons, the planned tasks, completed tasks, and the values on the buttons.
2. **Sorting:** The white and black buttons are sorted in descending order to maximize their effectiveness when used.
3. **Button Usage:** For each day, the code attempts to use the largest black button first to increase the completed tasks without exceeding the planned tasks. Then it uses the largest white button to reduce the planned tasks.
4. **Uncompleted Tasks Calculation:** After processing each day, it calculates the uncompleted tasks and ensures that it does not go negative.
5. **Output:** Finally, it prints the total uncompleted tasks for each test case.

This code should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks for the given test cases.

 Given the previous insights and the issues identified in the earlier attempts, I will revise the solution to ensure it correctly calculates the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally.

### Key Points to Address:
1. **Button Usage Logic:** We need to ensure that we are using the largest available black button first to increase completed tasks and the largest available white button to reduce planned tasks.
2. **Correct Calculation of Uncompleted Tasks:** We need to ensure that the calculation of uncompleted tasks does not go negative and is done correctly after processing each day.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef has a number of tasks planned over several days, but he can use buttons from a Time Machine to adjust the number of tasks he has to complete. There are two types of buttons: white buttons that can reduce the planned tasks and black buttons that can increase the completed tasks. The goal is to determine the minimum number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally over all days.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each day, we need to decide whether to use a white button to reduce the planned tasks or a black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - We will sort the white buttons in descending order to maximize the reduction of planned tasks and the black buttons in descending order to maximize the increase in completed tasks.
   - For each day, we will first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks. Then, we will use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks.
   - Finally, we will calculate the total uncompleted tasks after processing all days.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Chef has planned tasks (A) and completed tasks (B) for several days.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce planned tasks and black buttons to increase completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the total uncompleted tasks after all days.

2. **Identifying the Issues:**
   - The code incorrectly calculates the total uncompleted tasks. The formula used was `total_uncompleted_tasks += (A[day] - B[day])`, which can lead to negative values if more tasks are completed than planned.
   - The removal of buttons from the lists (C and D) is not handled correctly. Once a button is used, it should not be available for subsequent days, but the current implementation may not correctly track which buttons have been used.
   - The logic for using buttons does not ensure that we are using the best available button for each day. We should prioritize using the largest available buttons first to maximize the effect.

3. **Where I Went Wrong:**
   - The calculation of uncompleted tasks should ensure that it does not go negative. Instead of directly adding the difference, we should ensure that we only add non-negative values.
   - The button usage logic should be more robust, ensuring that we are using the largest available buttons effectively for both types of buttons.

### Revised Approach:
1. For each day, first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.
2. Then, use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks as much as possible.
3. Finally, calculate the total uncompleted tasks ensuring that it does not go negative.

### Revised Pseudocode:
```
function min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N, K, M
        read planned_tasks A
        read completed_tasks B
        read white_buttons C
        read black_buttons D

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Correct Calculation of Uncompleted Tasks:** The calculation of uncompleted tasks now uses `max(0, A[day] - B[day])` to ensure that we do not add negative values to the total.
2. **Button Usage Logic:** The logic for using black and white buttons has been retained, ensuring that we maximize the effect of each button used.
3. **Input Handling:** The input handling remains the same, ensuring that we read the test cases correctly.

This code should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks for the given test cases.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues in the previous solution step-by-step to identify why it failed to produce the correct output.

1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements:**
   - Chef has planned tasks (A) and completed tasks (B) for several days.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce the planned tasks and black buttons to increase the completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the total uncompleted tasks after all days.

2. **Identifying the Issues:**
   - The logic for using black buttons is not optimal. We should be using the largest black button available that can be applied without exceeding the planned tasks for that day.
   - The same applies to white buttons; we should be using the largest white button available that can be applied without going below zero in planned tasks.
   - The removal of buttons from the lists (C and D) is not handled correctly. Once a button is used, it should not be available for subsequent days, but the current implementation may not correctly track which buttons have been used.

3. **Where I Went Wrong:**
   - The previous implementation did not correctly account for the fact that we should be maximizing the use of buttons in a way that optimally reduces uncompleted tasks.
   - The calculation of uncompleted tasks was done correctly, but the way buttons were applied was not optimal, leading to incorrect results.

### Revised Approach:
1. For each day, first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.
2. Then, use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks as much as possible.
3. Finally, calculate the total uncompleted tasks ensuring that it does not go negative.

### Revised Pseudocode:

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling:** The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of days, the number of white and black buttons, the planned tasks, completed tasks, and the values on the buttons.
2. **Sorting:** The white and black buttons are sorted in descending order to maximize their effectiveness when used.
3. **Button Usage:** For each day, the code attempts to use the largest black button first to increase the completed tasks without exceeding the planned tasks. Then it uses the largest white button to reduce the planned tasks.
4. **Uncompleted Tasks Calculation:** After processing each day, it calculates the uncompleted tasks and ensures that it does not go negative.
5. **Output:** Finally, it prints the total uncompleted tasks for each test case.

This code should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks for the given test cases.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to minimize the total uncompleted tasks Chef has after using buttons from a Time Machine to adjust his planned and completed tasks over several days. The main challenge was to optimally use black buttons (to increase completed tasks) and white buttons (to decrease planned tasks) without exceeding the limits set by the tasks.

Throughout the attempts, the core concepts involved sorting the buttons in descending order to maximize their effectiveness and ensuring that the logic for applying these buttons was correctly implemented. The initial attempts failed primarily due to incorrect handling of button usage and the calculation of uncompleted tasks, which sometimes resulted in negative values.

The strategies that seemed to work included sorting the buttons and iterating through them to apply the largest available button first. However, the removal of buttons from the lists was not handled correctly, leading to incorrect results. The final solution aimed to ensure that after processing each day, the calculation of uncompleted tasks was done using `max(0, A[day] - B[day])` to avoid negative values.

Despite these adjustments, the solution still failed to produce the expected output for the provided test case, indicating that further refinement of the button application logic was necessary. This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing state changes (like button usage) and ensuring that all conditions are met before applying changes to the task counts.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:

4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef has a number of tasks planned over several days, but he can use buttons from a Time Machine to adjust the number of tasks he has to complete. There are two types of buttons: white buttons that can reduce the planned tasks and black buttons that can increase the completed tasks. The goal is to determine the minimum number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally over all days.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each day, we need to decide whether to use a white button to reduce the planned tasks or a black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - We will sort the white buttons in descending order to maximize the reduction of planned tasks and the black buttons in descending order to maximize the increase in completed tasks.
   - For each day, we will first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks. Then, we will use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks.
   - Finally, we will calculate the total uncompleted tasks after processing all days.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Chef has planned tasks (A) and completed tasks (B) for several days.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce planned tasks and black buttons to increase completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the total uncompleted tasks after all days.

2. **Identifying the Issues:**
   - The code incorrectly calculates the total uncompleted tasks. The formula used was `total_uncompleted_tasks += (A[day] - B[day])`, which can lead to negative values if more tasks are completed than planned.
   - The removal of buttons from the lists (C and D) is not handled correctly. Once a button is used, it should not be available for subsequent days, but the current implementation may not correctly track which buttons have been used.
   - The logic for using buttons does not ensure that we are using the best available button for each day. We should prioritize using the largest available buttons first to maximize the effect.

3. **Where I Went Wrong:**
   - The calculation of uncompleted tasks should ensure that it does not go negative. Instead of directly adding the difference, we should ensure that we only add non-negative values.
   - The button usage logic should be more robust, ensuring that we are using the largest available buttons effectively for both types of buttons.

### Revised Approach:
1. For each day, first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.
2. Then, use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks as much as possible.
3. Finally, calculate the total uncompleted tasks ensuring that it does not go negative.

### Revised Pseudocode:
```
function min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N, K, M
        read planned_tasks A
        read completed_tasks B
        read white_buttons C
        read black_buttons D
        
        sort C in descending order
        sort D in descending order
        
        total_uncompleted_tasks = 0
        
        for day from 0 to N-1:
            # Use black buttons first
            for black_button in D:
                if B[day] + black_button <= A[day]:
                    B[day] += black_button
                    remove black_button from D
                    break
            
            # Use white buttons next
            for white_button in C:
                if A[day] >= white_button:
                    A[day] -= white_button
                    remove white_button from C
                    break
            
            # Calculate uncompleted tasks for the day
            uncompleted_today = max(0, A[day] - B[day])
            total_uncompleted_tasks += uncompleted_today
        
        print total_uncompleted_tasks
```

### Revised Python Code:

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Correct Calculation of Uncompleted Tasks:** The calculation of uncompleted tasks now uses `max(0, A[day] - B[day])` to ensure that we do not add negative values to the total.
2. **Button Usage Logic:** The logic for using black and white buttons has been retained, ensuring that we maximize the effect of each button used.
3. **Input Handling:** The input handling remains the same, ensuring that we read the test cases correctly.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues in the previous solution step-by-step to identify why it failed to produce the correct output.

1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements:**
   - Chef has planned tasks (A) and completed tasks (B) for several days.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce the planned tasks and black buttons to increase the completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the total uncompleted tasks after all days.

2. **Identifying the Issues:**
   - The logic for using black buttons is not optimal. We should be using the largest black button available that can be applied without exceeding the planned tasks for that day.
   - The same applies to white buttons; we should be using the largest white button available that can be applied without going below zero in planned tasks.
   - The removal of buttons from the lists (C and D) is not handled correctly. Once a button is used, it should not be available for subsequent days, but the current implementation may not correctly track which buttons have been used.

3. **Where I Went Wrong:**
   - The previous implementation did not correctly account for the fact that we should be maximizing the use of buttons in a way that optimally reduces uncompleted tasks.
   - The calculation of uncompleted tasks was done correctly, but the way buttons were applied was not optimal, leading to incorrect results.

### Revised Approach:
1. For each day, first try to use the black buttons to increase the completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.
2. Then, use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks as much as possible.
3. Finally, calculate the total uncompleted tasks ensuring that it does not go negative.

### Revised Pseudocode:
```
function min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N, K, M
        read planned_tasks A
        read completed_tasks B
        read white_buttons C
        read black_buttons D
        
        sort C in descending order
        sort D in descending order
        
        total_uncompleted_tasks = 0
        
        for day from 0 to N-1:
            # Use black buttons first
            for black_button in D:
                if B[day] + black_button <= A[day]:
                    B[day] += black_button
                    D.remove(black_button)  # Remove the used button
                    break
            
            # Use white buttons next
            for white_button in C:
                if A[day] >= white_button:
                    A[day] -= white_button
                    C.remove(white_button)  # Remove the used button
                    break
            
            # Calculate uncompleted tasks for the day
            uncompleted_today = max(0, A[day] - B[day])  # Ensure non-negative
            total_uncompleted_tasks += uncompleted_today

2. **Correct Calculation of Uncompleted Tasks:** We need to ensure that the calculation of uncompleted tasks does not go negative and is done correctly after processing each day.

2. **Sorting:** The white and black buttons are sorted in descending order to maximize their effectiveness when used.
3. **Button Usage:** For each day, the code attempts to use the largest black button first to increase the completed tasks without exceeding the planned tasks. Then it uses the largest white button to reduce the planned tasks.
4. **Uncompleted Tasks Calculation:** After processing each day, it calculates the uncompleted tasks and ensures that it does not go negative.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [generation text] ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience

In my attempts to solve the problem, I focused on using the largest available buttons to maximize the reduction of uncompleted tasks. However, my approach had several flaws, particularly in the logic for button usage and the calculation of uncompleted tasks. The official solution provided a more effective method by leveraging sorting and a two-pointer technique to optimize the use of buttons.

**Key Insights from the Official Solution:**
1. **Sorting and Combining Buttons:** The official solution combines the black and white button values into a single list and sorts it. This allows for a more straightforward application of the buttons in descending order of effectiveness.
2. **Using a Difference Function:** The solution calculates the difference between planned and completed tasks upfront, which simplifies the logic for determining how many tasks remain uncompleted.
3. **Efficient Button Application:** By iterating through the sorted list of task differences and the combined button list, the solution efficiently applies the largest available button to reduce the uncompleted tasks, ensuring that the logic is both clear and effective.

**Why My Approach Failed:**
- My implementation did not effectively manage the button usage, leading to suboptimal reductions in planned tasks.
- The calculation of uncompleted tasks was not handled correctly, resulting in incorrect outputs.
- The official solution's use of sorting and a combined list allowed for a more efficient and clear approach to solving the problem, which I did not fully utilize in my attempts.

In summary, the official solution's approach to sorting and efficiently applying buttons provided a clearer path to the correct answer, highlighting the importance of optimizing the order of operations in algorithmic problem-solving.
