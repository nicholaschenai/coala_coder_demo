    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The problem involves helping Chef determine how many walls he needs to break through to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). Each wall is represented by a line segment connecting points on the x-axis and y-axis. For each starting position of Chef, we need to check if he is on a wall, and if not, count how many walls he would need to break to reach the origin.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - For each test case, read the number of walls and their respective positions.\n   - For each query (Chef's starting position), check if the position lies on any wall. If it does, return -1.\n   - If not, determine how many walls Chef would need to break through to reach the origin. This can be done by checking how many wall positions are greater than the maximum of Chef's x and y coordinates.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function process_test_cases(T):\n       for each test case:\n           read N\n           read wall positions a_i\n           read Q\n           for each query:\n               read x_j, y_j\n               if (x_j, y_j) is on any wall:\n                   print -1\n               else:\n                   count = 0\n                   for each wall position a_i:\n                       if a_i > max(x_j, y_j):\n                           count += 1\n                   print count\n\n   read T\n   process_test_cases(T)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef process_test_cases(T):\n    for _ in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case\n        N = int(input())  # Read number of walls\n        walls = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read wall positions\n        Q = int(input())  # Read number of queries\n        \n        for __ in range(Q):  # Iterate over each query\n            x_j, y_j = map(int, input().split())  # Read Chef's starting position\n            \n            # Check if the position lies on any wall\n            if x_j == y_j and x_j in walls:\n                print(-1)  # Chef is on a wall\n                continue\n            \n            # Count how many walls Chef needs to break\n            count = 0\n            max_coord = max(x_j, y_j)  # Get the maximum of x and y coordinates\n            \n            for wall in walls:  # Iterate through each wall\n                if wall > max_coord:  # If wall is above the maximum coordinate\n                    count += 1  # Increment the count\n            \n            print(count)  # Output the number of walls to break\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nprocess_test_cases(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases\n```",
