    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   Chef wants to create a schedule for his restaurant where he serves one of four Ukrainian dishes each day. The dishes must be different from one day to the next, and the first and last dishes must also be different. Given a number of days, we need to calculate how many valid schedules can be created under these constraints.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   - For each day, there are 4 choices of dishes.\n   - The first day can have any of the 4 dishes.\n   - For the second day, there are 3 choices (since it must be different from the first).\n   - For the third day onward, there are 3 choices for each day (since it must be different from the previous day).\n   - However, the last day must also be different from the first day, which adds a constraint.\n   - We can calculate the total number of valid schedules using combinatorial logic.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function calculate_schedules(N):\n       if N == 2:\n           return 12  # Special case for 2 days\n       else:\n           total_schedules = 4 * 3  # First day has 4 options, second day has 3 options\n           for i from 3 to N-1:\n               total_schedules *= 3  # Each subsequent day has 3 options\n           # Adjust for the last day being different from the first\n           total_schedules *= 2  # Last day can be any of the 2 remaining options\n           return total_schedules\n\n   function main():\n       T = read number of test cases\n       for each test case:\n           N = read number of days\n           result = calculate_schedules(N)\n           print(result)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef calculate_schedules(N):\n    # Special case for 2 days\n    if N == 2:\n        return 12\n    else:\n        # Start with the first two days\n        total_schedules = 4 * 3  # 4 options for the first day, 3 for the second\n        # For each subsequent day until the last day\n        for i in range(3, N):\n            total_schedules *= 3  # Each day has 3 options\n        # The last day must be different from the first day\n        total_schedules *= 2  # 2 options for the last day\n        return total_schedules\n\ndef main():\n    T = int(input())  # Read number of test cases\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())  # Read number of days\n        result = calculate_schedules(N)  # Calculate the number of schedules\n        print(result)  # Output the result\n\nmain()  # Call the main function to execute the program\n```",
