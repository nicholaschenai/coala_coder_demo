    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to calculate the number of valid schedules for Chef's restaurant, where dishes must be different on consecutive days and the first and last dishes must also differ. The challenge involved deriving the correct formula to account for these constraints.\n\nInitially, I attempted to use the formula \\(4 \\times 3^{(N-1)}\\) for N > 2, which did not yield the expected results. This approach failed to correctly account for the requirement that the last dish must differ from the first dish. After several iterations, I realized that the correct formula should be \\(4 \\times 3^{(N-2)} \\times 2\\). This formula correctly considers:\n- 4 choices for the first day,\n- 3 choices for each of the middle days (N-2),\n- 2 choices for the last day (different from the first).\n\nThe final implementation of the code was as follows:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_schedules(N):\n    if N == 2:\n        return 12\n    else:\n        total_schedules = 4 * (3 ** (N - 2)) * 2\n        return total_schedules\n\ndef main():\n    T = int(input())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        result = calculate_schedules(N)\n        print(result)\n\nmain()\n```\n\nDespite the logical corrections, the code encountered runtime errors during execution, indicating potential issues with handling large inputs or inefficiencies in the calculation. This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly testing edge cases and ensuring that the implementation can handle the upper limits of input constraints effectively. Future attempts should focus on optimizing the calculation, especially for large values of N, potentially using modular arithmetic to prevent overflow and improve performance.",
    "reflection": "In my attempts to solve the problem, I initially misunderstood the constraints regarding the scheduling of dishes. My approach involved calculating the number of valid schedules based on the choices available for each day, but I failed to account for the specific requirement that the last dish must be different from the first dish in a more efficient manner.\n\nThe official solution leverages the mathematical properties of powers to derive the number of valid schedules in a more concise way. It uses the formula `pow(3, n, r) + pow(-1, n) * 3`, where `r` is a large prime number (1000000007) to handle large outputs. This approach effectively counts the valid combinations by recognizing that:\n\n1. `pow(3, n, r)` calculates the total combinations for N days where each day can be any of the 3 remaining dishes after the first day.\n2. `pow(-1, n) * 3` adjusts the count based on whether N is even or odd, ensuring that the first and last dishes are different.\n\nThis method is not only more efficient but also avoids the pitfalls of manual combinatorial calculations that can lead to errors, especially with larger values of N. \n\nIn summary, the key takeaway is that leveraging mathematical functions like exponentiation can simplify the problem significantly, especially when dealing with constraints that involve large numbers. My previous attempts were overly complicated and did not utilize these mathematical insights effectively.",
