## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.

Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.

The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.

Each customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ â€” the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ â€” the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ â€” the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.

A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.

Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.


-----Input-----

Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $-10^9 \le m \le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.

Next, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^9$, $-10^9 \le l_i \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.

The customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Example-----
Input
4
3 0
5 1 2
7 3 5
10 -1 0
2 12
5 7 10
10 16 20
3 -100
100 0 0
100 -50 50
200 100 100
1 100
99 -100 0

Output
YES
NO
YES
NO



-----Note-----

In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. 

In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.

In the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 20 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Gildong runs a bulgogi restaurant and wants to ensure that all customers are satisfied with the temperature when they arrive. Each customer has a specific time they will arrive and a preferred temperature range. The restaurant has an air conditioner that can either heat, cool, or maintain the current temperature. The goal is to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature to meet the preferences of all customers based on their arrival times.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   We need to track the temperature range that can be achieved by the time each customer arrives. Starting from the initial temperature, we will calculate how much time has passed since the last customer and adjust the temperature range accordingly. For each customer, we will check if the current achievable temperature range overlaps with their preferred range. If it does, we will update the achievable range for the next customer based on the time until their arrival. If at any point the ranges do not overlap, we will conclude that it is impossible to satisfy all customers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function canSatisfyCustomers(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read n, m

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.

Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.

The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute exactly \( K \) amount of money to \( N \) minions based on their individual demands. The key points to consider were whether the total demand from the minions matched \( K \), was less than \( K \), or exceeded \( K \).

    Initially, the approach focused on checking if the total demand equaled \( K \) and incorrectly assumed that if the total demand was less than \( K \), Gru could always distribute the remaining money. This led to incorrect outputs, particularly in cases where the remaining money could not be distributed without exceeding individual demands.

    The correct logic should have been:
    1. If the total demand equals \( K \), print "YES".
    2. If the total demand is less than \( K \), print "YES" since Gru can distribute the remaining money.
    3. If the total demand exceeds \( K \), print "NO".

    Despite multiple attempts to refine the logic, the solution consistently failed to account for the distribution constraints properly. The final code snippet aimed to address these issues but still produced incorrect results, indicating a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.

    ### Key Takeaways:
    - Ensure to fully understand the constraints of distribution when dealing with remaining amounts.
    - Always validate the logic against edge cases to ensure correctness.
    - The problem highlighted the importance of careful condition checking in scenarios involving sums and distributions. 

    ### Final Code Snippet:

            N = case[0]

            demands = case[2]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
        
            if total_demand == K:
                print("YES")
            elif total_demand < K:
                print("YES")

[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which candidate Chef hires for the distribution task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly, while the second candidate places all apples in the box with the least apples. 

    The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) is equal to the number of apples (N), both candidates will end up with the same distribution (all apples in one box). However, if K is less than N, the distributions can differ, leading to a "NO" answer. The solution involved checking these conditions for each test case.

    The implemented solution was straightforward, iterating through the test cases and applying the logic to determine the output. The final code effectively handled the input and output requirements without any errors. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case
            if K == N:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        test_cases.append((N, K))

    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and how they influence the solution's logic.

INFO - [Task id] 20 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Gildong runs a restaurant and wants to ensure that the temperature is suitable for all customers who have made reservations. Each customer has a specific time they will arrive and a preferred temperature range. The air conditioner can be set to heat, cool, or remain off, and the temperature changes accordingly. The task is to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature to satisfy all customers at their respective arrival times.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:

Starting from the initial temperature, we will calculate how much time has passed since the last customer and adjust the temperature range accordingly. For each customer, we will check if the current achievable temperature range overlaps with their preferred range. If it does for all customers, we can satisfy them; otherwise, we cannot.

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Gildong runs a restaurant and wants to ensure that the temperature is suitable for all customers who have made reservations. Each customer has a specific time they will arrive and a preferred temperature range. The air conditioner can be set to heat, cool, or remain off, and the temperature changes accordingly. The task is to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature to satisfy all customers at their respective arrival times.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   We need to track the temperature range that can be achieved at each customer's arrival time. Starting from the initial temperature, we will calculate how much time has passed since the last customer and adjust the temperature range accordingly. For each customer, we will check if the current achievable temperature range overlaps with their preferred range. If it does for all customers, we can satisfy them; otherwise, we cannot.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_satisfy_customers(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read n (number of customers) and m (initial temperature)

               update current_min_temp and current_max_temp to be within l_i and h_i:

                   current_max_temp = min(current_max_temp, h_i)

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.

Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.

The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.

Each customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ â€” the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ â€” the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ â€” the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.

A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.

Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.


-----Input-----

Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $-10^9 \le m \le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.

Next, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^9$, $-10^9 \le l_i \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.

The customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Example-----
Input
4
3 0
5 1 2
7 3 5
10 -1 0
2 12
5 7 10
10 16 20
3 -100
100 0 0
100 -50 50
200 100 100
1 100
99 -100 0

Output
YES
NO
YES
NO



-----Note-----

In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. 

In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.

In the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 20 [generation text] In this problem, the main challenge was to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature of a restaurant to satisfy all customers based on their preferred temperature ranges at specific arrival times. The solution involved tracking the achievable temperature range over time and ensuring it overlaps with each customer's preferred range.

The core concept was to calculate the time elapsed since the last customer and adjust the current temperature range accordingly. This required careful management of the minimum and maximum temperatures that could be achieved at each customer's arrival time. If at any point the achievable range did not overlap with a customer's preferred range, the answer for that test case would be "NO".

The implemented solution effectively handled multiple test cases and utilized a straightforward loop to process each customer. The logic for updating the temperature range and checking for overlaps was clear and efficient. The final code successfully passed all provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was sound.

Key takeaways include the importance of managing state over time and ensuring that conditions are checked at each step to maintain the validity of the solution. This problem reinforced the need for careful consideration of edge cases, particularly with large ranges and time intervals.

Each customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ â€” the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ â€” the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ â€” the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.

A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.

Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.


-----Input-----

Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $-10^9 \le m \le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.

Next, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^9$, $-10^9 \le l_i \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.

The customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Example-----

3 0
5 1 2

100 -50 50
200 100 100
1 100
99 -100 0

Output
YES
NO
YES
NO



-----Note-----

In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. 

In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.

In the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 20 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Gildong runs a restaurant and wants to ensure that the temperature is suitable for all customers who have made reservations. Each customer has a specific time they will arrive and a preferred temperature range. The air conditioner can be set to heat, cool, or remain off, and the temperature changes accordingly. The task is to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature to satisfy all customers at their respective arrival times.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   We need to track the temperature range that can be achieved at each customer's arrival time. Starting from the initial temperature, we will calculate how much time has passed since the last customer and adjust the temperature range accordingly. For each customer, we will check if the current achievable temperature range overlaps with their preferred range. If it does for all customers, we can satisfy them; otherwise, we cannot.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_satisfy_customers(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read n (number of customers) and m (initial temperature)
           initialize current_time to 0
           initialize current_min_temp to m
           initialize current_max_temp to m
           
           for each customer in test_case:
               read t_i, l_i, h_i (arrival time and preferred temperature range)
               time_passed = t_i - current_time
               
               update current_min_temp and current_max_temp:
                   current_min_temp -= time_passed
                   current_max_temp += time_passed
               
               update current_min_temp and current_max_temp to be within l_i and h_i:
                   current_min_temp = max(current_min_temp, l_i)
                   current_max_temp = min(current_max_temp, h_i)
               
               if current_min_temp > current_max_temp:
                   print "NO"
                   break
               
               update current_time to t_i
           else:
               print "YES"
   ```

    if flag:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

INFO - [Task id] 20 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem by maintaining a dynamic range of achievable temperatures as customers arrive. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Initialization**: The solution starts by reading the number of test cases and initializing the current temperature range (`now`) to the initial temperature for both the minimum and maximum.

2. **Iterating through Customers**: For each customer, the solution calculates the time elapsed since the last customer and adjusts the current temperature range accordingly. This is done by subtracting the elapsed time from the minimum temperature and adding it to the maximum temperature.

3. **Checking Overlap**: The solution checks if the adjusted temperature range overlaps with the customer's preferred range. If there is no overlap, it sets a flag to indicate that not all customers can be satisfied.

4. **Updating the Range**: If there is an overlap, the solution updates the current temperature range to reflect the intersection of the achievable range and the customer's preferred range.

5. **Final Decision**: After processing all customers, the solution prints "YES" if all customers can be satisfied, otherwise "NO".

### Key Takeaways:
- The approach of maintaining a dynamic range of temperatures is efficient and straightforward.
- The use of flags to track the possibility of satisfying all customers simplifies the decision-making process.
- The solution effectively handles the constraints and ensures that the temperature adjustments are calculated based on the time elapsed, which is crucial for determining the achievable temperature range.

This experience reinforced the importance of maintaining state and dynamically adjusting it based on incoming data, which is a common pattern in algorithmic problem-solving.

The main function is `can_satisfy_customers`.
INFO - [Task id] 20 [generation text] The function processes multiple test cases to determine if a series of customers can be satisfied based on their preferred temperature ranges and the initial temperature. For each test case, it tracks the current time and temperature range, adjusting these values as each customer arrives. It checks if the achievable temperature range can accommodate each customer's preferences, updating the range accordingly. If at any point the temperature range becomes invalid, it outputs "NO" for that test case. If all customers can be satisfied within their preferred ranges, it outputs "YES". The function ultimately evaluates the feasibility of meeting customer demands based on time and temperature constraints.

[Problem]
    Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.

    Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.

    The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.

    Each customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ â€” the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ â€” the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ â€” the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.

    A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.

    Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.


    -----Input-----

    Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.

    The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $-10^9 \le m \le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.

    Next, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^9$, $-10^9 \le l_i \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.

    The customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.


    -----Output-----

    For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print "NO".

    You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

    -----Note-----

    In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. 

    In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.

    In the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.
