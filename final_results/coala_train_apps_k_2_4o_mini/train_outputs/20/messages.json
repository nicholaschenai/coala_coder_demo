The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.\n\nGildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.\n\nEach customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ \u2014 the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ \u2014 the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ \u2014 the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.\n\nA customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.\n\nGiven the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$, $-10^9 \\le m \\le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.\n\nNext, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \\le t_i \\le 10^9$, $-10^9 \\le l_i \\le h_i \\le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.\n\nThe customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n3 0\n5 1 2\n7 3 5\n10 -1 0\n2 12\n5 7 10\n10 16 20\n3 -100\n100 0 0\n100 -50 50\n200 100 100\n1 100\n99 -100 0\n\nOutput\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. \n\nIn the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.\n\nIn the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Each customer has a specific time they will arrive and a preferred temperature range. The restaurant has an air conditioner that can either heat, cool, or maintain the current temperature. The goal is to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature to meet the preferences of all customers based on their arrival times.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   We need to track the temperature range that can be achieved by the time each customer arrives. Starting from the initial temperature, we will calculate how much time has passed since the last customer and adjust the temperature range accordingly. For each customer, we will check if the current achievable temperature range overlaps with their preferred range. If it does, we will update the achievable range for the next customer based on the time until their arrival. If at any point the ranges do not overlap, we will conclude that it is impossible to satisfy all customers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function canSatisfyCustomers(test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read n, m\n           current_time = 0\n           min_temp = m\n           max_temp = m\n           \n           for each customer in test_case:\n               t_i, l_i, h_i = customer\n               time_passed = t_i - current_time\n               \n               # Update the temperature range based on time passed\n               min_temp -= time_passed\n               max_temp += time_passed\n               \n               # Update the achievable range to be within the customer's range\n               min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)\n               max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)\n               \n               # If the ranges do not overlap, it's impossible\n               if min_temp > max_temp:\n                   print(\"NO\")\n                   break\n               \n               current_time = t_i\n           else:\n               print(\"YES\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef canSatisfyCustomers(test_cases):\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        # Read number of customers and initial temperature\n        n, m = test_case[0]\n        current_time = 0\n        min_temp = m\n        max_temp = m\n        \n        # Iterate through each customer\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            t_i, l_i, h_i = test_case[i]\n            time_passed = t_i - current_time\n            \n            # Update the temperature range based on time passed\n            min_temp -= time_passed\n            max_temp += time_passed\n            \n            # Update the achievable range to be within the customer's range\n            min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)\n            max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)\n            \n            # If the ranges do not overlap, it's impossible\n            if min_temp > max_temp:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                break\n            \n            current_time = t_i\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# canSatisfyCustomers([\n#     [(3, 0), (5, 1, 2), (7, 3, 5), (10, -1, 0)],\n#     [(2, 12), (5, 7, 10), (10, 16, 20)],\n#     [(3, -100), (100, 0, 0), (100, -50, 50), (200, 100, 100)],\n#     [(1, 100), (99, -100, 0)]\n# ])\n```"

The key points to consider were whether the total demand from the minions matched \\( K \\), was less than \\( K \\), or exceeded \\( K \\).\n\n    Initially, the approach focused on checking if the total demand equaled \\( K \\) and incorrectly assumed that if the total demand was less than \\( K \\), Gru could always distribute the remaining money. This led to incorrect outputs, particularly in cases where the remaining money could not be distributed without exceeding individual demands.\n\n    The correct logic should have been:\n    1. If the total demand equals \\( K \\), print \"YES\".\n    2. If the total demand is less than \\( K \\), print \"YES\" since Gru can distribute the remaining money.\n    3. If the total demand exceeds \\( K \\), print \"NO\".\n\n    Despite multiple attempts to refine the logic, the solution consistently failed to account for the distribution constraints properly. The final code snippet aimed to address these issues but still produced incorrect results, indicating a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.\n\n    ### Key Takeaways:\n    - Ensure to fully understand the constraints of distribution when dealing with remaining amounts.\n    - Always validate the logic against edge cases to ensure correctness.\n    - The problem highlighted the importance of careful condition checking in scenarios involving sums and distributions. \n\n    ### Final Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            K = case[1]\n            demands = case[2]\n            total_demand = sum(demands)\n        \n            if total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            elif total_demand < K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        demands = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, demands))\n\n    can_distribute_money(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the core concepts, strategies attempted, and the errors encountered during the problem-solving process.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which candidate Chef hires for the distribution task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly, while the second candidate places all apples in the box with the least apples. \n\n    The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) is equal to the number of apples (N), both candidates will end up with the same distribution (all apples in one box). However, if K is less than N, the distributions can differ, leading to a \"NO\" answer. The solution involved checking these conditions for each test case.\n\n    The implemented solution was straightforward, iterating through the test cases and applying the logic to determine the output. The final code effectively handled the input and output requirements without any errors. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            if K == N:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        test_cases.append((N, K))\n\n    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and how they influence the solution's logic.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
