## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \leq i \leq N$.    
A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.
Given these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?

-----Input:-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.
- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ respectively. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^2$
- $1 \le K \le 10^9$ 
- $1 \le D \le 10^9$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^7$ for each valid $i$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (40 points):
- $N = 1$
- $1 \le A_1 \le 10^5$
Subtask #2 (60 points): Original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----

1 10 3
23
2 5 7
20 36
2 5 10
19 2
3 3 300
1 1 1

-----Sample Output:-----
0
2
7
4
1

-----Explanation:-----
- 
Example case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.
- 
Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.
- 
Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.

INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef wants to organize Division-3 contests over a certain number of days. Each contest requires a specific number of problems. There are multiple problem setters, each contributing a certain number of problems. The goal is to determine how many contests Chef can host given the total number of problems available, the number of problems required for each contest, and the maximum number of days available for hosting contests.

2. **Conceptualize a solution:**
   - For each test case, read the number of setters, the number of problems required for a contest, and the number of days available.
   - Read the number of problems each setter has created.
   - Calculate the total number of problems available by summing the contributions from all setters.
   - Determine how many contests can be formed by dividing the total number of problems by the number of problems required for each contest.
   - The maximum number of contests Chef can host is the lesser of the number of contests that can be formed and the number of days available.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_contests(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, K, D
           read A (list of problems from each setter)
           total_problems = sum(A)
           contests_possible = total_problems // K
           max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
           print(max_contests)
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 solution:**
```python
def max_contests(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(T):
        N, K, D = test_cases[i][0]
        A = test_cases[i][1]

        # The maximum contests Chef can host is limited by the number of days
        max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
        
        # Store the result for this test case

## Problem

Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \leq i \leq N$.    
A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute exactly \( K \) amount of money to \( N \) minions based on their individual demands. The key points to consider were whether the total demand from the minions matched \( K \), was less than \( K \), or exceeded \( K \).

    Initially, the approach focused on checking if the total demand equaled \( K \) and incorrectly assumed that if the total demand was less than \( K \), Gru could always distribute the remaining money. This led to incorrect outputs, particularly in cases where the remaining money could not be distributed without exceeding individual demands.

    The correct logic should have been:
    1. If the total demand equals \( K \), print "YES".
    2. If the total demand is less than \( K \), print "YES" since Gru can distribute the remaining money.
    3. If the total demand exceeds \( K \), print "NO".

    Despite multiple attempts to refine the logic, the solution consistently failed to account for the distribution constraints properly. The final code snippet aimed to address these issues but still produced incorrect results, indicating a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.

    ### Key Takeaways:
    - Ensure to fully understand the constraints of distribution when dealing with remaining amounts.
    - Always validate the logic against edge cases to ensure correctness.
    - The problem highlighted the importance of careful condition checking in scenarios involving sums and distributions. 

    ### Final Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            K = case[1]
            demands = case[2]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
        
            if total_demand == K:
                print("YES")
            elif total_demand < K:
                print("YES")

[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine how many walls he needs to break to reach Dr. Doof, based on given wall positions and Chef's starting coordinates. The problem involved checking if Chef's position was on any wall and counting how many walls were above his maximum coordinate.

    The core concept involved understanding the geometric representation of walls as line segments and how to efficiently determine the number of walls Chef would need to break through. The solution utilized a straightforward approach of iterating through wall positions and comparing them to Chef's coordinates.

    The implemented solution successfully handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that if Chef's position was on a wall, it returned -1. Otherwise, it counted the walls that were above the maximum of Chef's x and y coordinates. The code was structured to read multiple test cases and queries efficiently.

    Key takeaways include the importance of checking conditions before performing calculations and the efficiency of using simple comparisons to solve geometric problems. The solution was effective, and no unexpected errors occurred during implementation. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def process_test_cases(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            walls = list(map(int, input().split()))
            Q = int(input())
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                x_j, y_j = map(int, input().split())
            
                if x_j == y_j and x_j in walls:
                    print(-1)
                    continue
            
                count = 0
                max_coord = max(x_j, y_j)
            
                for wall in walls:
                    if wall > max_coord:
                        count += 1

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \leq i \leq N$.    
A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.
Given these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?

-----Input:-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.
- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ respectively. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^2$
- $1 \le K \le 10^9$ 
- $1 \le D \le 10^9$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^7$ for each valid $i$

-----Sample Output:-----

1

-----Explanation:-----
- 
Example case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.
- 
Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.
- 
Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.

INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host given the number of problems created by his setters, the number of problems required for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.

The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the number of days available to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for summation and list handling.

The final implementation successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code was structured to first read input values, process each test case, and then output the results. Key strategies included using integer division to determine the number of contests and the `min` function to ensure the result did not exceed the available days. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of clear problem breakdown and efficient use of built-in functions in Python. 

Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

def max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for T in range(int (eval(input()))):
 N,K,D=list(map(int,input().split()))
 A=list(map(int,input().split()))
 P=sum(A)//K 
 print(min(P,D))


INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] The official solution is concise and effectively addresses the problem with minimal complexity. It follows a straightforward approach that can be distilled into a few key steps:

1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it retrieves the values of N (number of setters), K (problems needed for a contest), and D (available days). It also reads the list of problems created by each setter.

2. **Total Problems Calculation**: The solution calculates the total number of problems by summing the list A directly.

3. **Contests Calculation**: It computes the number of possible contests by performing integer division of the total problems by K.

4. **Final Output**: The result for each test case is the minimum of the number of possible contests and the number of days available, which is printed directly.

The official solution is efficient, operating in O(N) time complexity for each test case due to the summation of the list, which is optimal given the constraints. My initial solution was similar in logic but included unnecessary unpacking and variable assignments that could be streamlined. 

Overall, the official solution's brevity and clarity serve as a reminder of the importance of simplicity in coding, especially when the problem can be solved with straightforward arithmetic operations.

[Problem]
    Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \leq i \leq N$.    
    A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.
    Given these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?

    -----Input:-----
    - The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
    - The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.
    - The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ respectively. 

    -----Output:-----
    For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$
    - $1 \leq N \leq 10^2$
    - $1 \le K \le 10^9$ 
    - $1 \le D \le 10^9$
    - $1 \le A_i \le 10^7$ for each valid $i$

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask #1 (40 points):
    - $N = 1$
    - $1 \le A_1 \le 10^5$
    Subtask #2 (60 points): Original constraints

    -----Sample Input:-----
    5
    1 5 31
    4
    1 10 3
    23
    2 5 7
    20 36
    2 5 10
    19 2
    3 3 300
    1 1 1

    -----Sample Output:-----
    0
    2
    7
    4
    1

    -----Explanation:-----
    - 
    Example case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.
    - 
    Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.
    - 
    Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.
