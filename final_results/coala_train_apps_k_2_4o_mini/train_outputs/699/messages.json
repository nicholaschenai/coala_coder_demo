Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \\leq i \\leq N$.    \nA Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.\nGiven these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?\n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.\n- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$ respectively. \n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2015 the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^3$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^2$\n- $1 \\le K \\le 10^9$ \n- $1 \\le D \\le 10^9$\n- $1 \\le A_i \\le 10^7$ for each valid $i$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (40 points):\n- $N = 1$\n- $1 \\le A_1 \\le 10^5$\nSubtask #2 (60 points): Original constraints\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n5\n1 5 31\n4\n1 10 3\n23\n2 5 7\n20 36\n2 5 10\n19 2\n3 3 300\n1 1 1\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n0\n2\n7\n4\n1\n\n-----Explanation:-----\n- \nExample case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.\n- \nExample case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.\n- \nExample case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The key points to consider were whether the total demand from the minions matched \\( K \\), was less than \\( K \\), or exceeded \\( K \\).\n\n    Initially, the approach focused on checking if the total demand equaled \\( K \\) and incorrectly assumed that if the total demand was less than \\( K \\), Gru could always distribute the remaining money. This led to incorrect outputs, particularly in cases where the remaining money could not be distributed without exceeding individual demands.\n\n    The correct logic should have been:\n    1. If the total demand equals \\( K \\), print \"YES\".\n    2. If the total demand is less than \\( K \\), print \"YES\" since Gru can distribute the remaining money.\n    3. If the total demand exceeds \\( K \\), print \"NO\".\n\n    Despite multiple attempts to refine the logic, the solution consistently failed to account for the distribution constraints properly. The final code snippet aimed to address these issues but still produced incorrect results, indicating a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.\n\n    ### Key Takeaways:\n    - Ensure to fully understand the constraints of distribution when dealing with remaining amounts.\n    - Always validate the logic against edge cases to ensure correctness.\n    - The problem highlighted the importance of careful condition checking in scenarios involving sums and distributions. \n\n    ### Final Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            K = case[1]\n            demands = case[2]\n            total_demand = sum(demands)\n        \n            if total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            elif total_demand < K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        demands = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, demands))\n\n    can_distribute_money(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the core concepts, strategies attempted, and the errors encountered during the problem-solving process.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine how many walls he needs to break to reach Dr. Doof, based on given wall positions and Chef's starting coordinates. The problem involved checking if Chef's position was on any wall and counting how many walls were above his maximum coordinate.\n\n    The core concept involved understanding the geometric representation of walls as line segments and how to efficiently determine the number of walls Chef would need to break through. The solution utilized a straightforward approach of iterating through wall positions and comparing them to Chef's coordinates.\n\n    The implemented solution successfully handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that if Chef's position was on a wall, it returned -1. Otherwise, it counted the walls that were above the maximum of Chef's x and y coordinates. The code was structured to read multiple test cases and queries efficiently.\n\n    Key takeaways include the importance of checking conditions before performing calculations and the efficiency of using simple comparisons to solve geometric problems. The solution was effective, and no unexpected errors occurred during implementation. The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def process_test_cases(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            walls = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            Q = int(input())\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                x_j, y_j = map(int, input().split())\n            \n                if x_j == y_j and x_j in walls:\n                    print(-1)\n                    continue\n            \n                count = 0\n                max_coord = max(x_j, y_j)\n            \n                for wall in walls:\n                    if wall > max_coord:\n                        count += 1\n            \n                print(count)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    process_test_cases(T)\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process and the final solution, which can be referenced for similar geometric problems in the future.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
