    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to determine if a tennis tournament with \\( N \\) players could be structured such that each player wins the same number of matches. The key insights were that if \\( N \\) is odd, it's impossible to achieve this, while if \\( N \\) is even, a round-robin style win/loss matrix can be constructed.\n\nThe initial attempts focused on generating the win/loss matrix correctly, but the output format was not aligned with the requirements. Specifically, the matrix rows were not being printed as complete strings of '0's and '1's, leading to incorrect outputs. \n\nThe correct approach involved initializing a matrix of size \\( N \\times N \\) filled with '0's and then updating the matrix to reflect wins for each player against half of the other players. The final output needed to ensure that each row was printed as a single string.\n\nDespite multiple revisions, the output formatting issues persisted, indicating a need for careful attention to how results are printed. The final code structure was correct, but the output still did not match the expected format, highlighting the importance of precise output handling in competitive programming.\n\nKey learning points include:\n- The necessity of clear output formatting in programming challenges.\n- The importance of understanding the problem constraints and how they affect the solution structure.\n- The need for thorough testing against expected outputs to catch formatting errors.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\nIn my attempts to solve the problem, I initially focused on generating a win/loss matrix for a tennis tournament based on the number of players \\( N \\). My approach was to check if \\( N \\) was odd or even and then construct the matrix accordingly. However, I overlooked the requirement that if \\( N \\) is odd, the output should be \"NO\", and if \\( N \\) is even, the output should be \"YES\" followed by the matrix. \n\nThe official solution provided a clearer and more effective approach. It correctly identifies that if \\( N \\) is even, it should print \"NO\" instead of \"YES\". The official solution also constructs the win/loss matrix in a more straightforward manner by using a list to track wins for each player and then converting that list to a string for output. \n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n1. **Odd vs. Even Check**: The solution correctly identifies that if \\( N \\) is odd, it should print \"NO\" and if even, it should proceed to generate the matrix.\n2. **Matrix Construction**: The official solution uses a simple list to count wins for each player, which is more efficient and easier to understand than my previous approach.\n3. **Output Formatting**: The solution constructs the output string in a single pass, ensuring that the format is correct.\n\nOverall, the official solution is more concise and directly addresses the problem requirements, highlighting the importance of careful output formatting and logical flow in problem-solving.",
