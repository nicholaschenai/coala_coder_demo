    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   We need to determine if it's possible for a group of players in a tennis tournament to each win the same number of matches when every player plays against every other player exactly once. If it's possible, we also need to provide a specific arrangement of wins and losses for each player.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   - If the number of players \\( N \\) is odd, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches because the total number of matches played will be even, and each player would need to win an integer number of matches.\n   - If \\( N \\) is even, we can create a round-robin style win/loss matrix where each player wins against half of the other players and loses against the other half. This can be achieved by having player \\( i \\) win against players \\( (i+1) \\) to \\( (i + N/2) \\) (modulo \\( N \\)).\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           N = test_case\n           if N is odd:\n               print \"NO\"\n           else:\n               print \"YES\"\n               initialize a N x N matrix with all zeros\n               for i from 0 to N-1:\n                   for j from 1 to N/2:\n                       matrix[i][(i + j) % N] = 1  // player i wins against player (i + j) % N\n               for each row in matrix:\n                   print row as a string of 0s and 1s\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases):\n    for N in test_cases:\n        if N % 2 != 0:  # Check if N is odd\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            # Initialize a N x N matrix with all zeros\n            results = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]\n            for i in range(N):\n                for j in range(1, N // 2 + 1):\n                    results[i][(i + j) % N] = '1'  # Player i wins against player (i + j) % N\n            for row in results:\n                print(''.join(row))  # Print each row as a string of 0s and 1s\n\n# Read number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())\n    test_cases.append(N)\n\ngenerate_tournament_results(T, test_cases)\n```",
