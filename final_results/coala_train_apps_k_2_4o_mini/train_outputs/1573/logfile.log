## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

-----Output:-----
- If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
- Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
- If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
- You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
- You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 10 points : $2 \leq N \leq 6$
- 90 points :  Original Constraints. 

-----Sample Input:-----
2
3
2

-----Sample Output:-----
YES
010
001
100
NO

-----Explanation:-----
One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to determine if it's possible for a group of players in a tennis tournament to each win the same number of matches when every player plays against every other player exactly once. If it's possible, we also need to provide a representation of the match outcomes in a specific format.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - If the number of players \( N \) is odd, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches because each player would have to win \( (N-1)/2 \) matches, which is not an integer. Thus, we would output "NO".
   - If \( N \) is even, we can create a round-robin tournament where each player wins exactly \( N/2 \) matches. We can achieve this by having players win against the next \( N/2 \) players in a circular manner. For example, player 1 beats players 2 to \( N/2 + 1 \), player 2 beats players 3 to \( N/2 + 2 \), and so on, wrapping around when necessary.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N = test_case
           if N is odd:
               print "NO"
           else:
               print "YES"
               create a 2D list results of size N x N initialized with '0'
               for i from 0 to N-1:
                   for j from 1 to N/2:
                       results[i][(i + j) % N] = '1'  // player i wins against player (i + j) % N
               for each row in results:
                   print row as a string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 != 0:  # Check if N is odd
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine the winner of a game played between two players based on the integer \( N \). The key insight was recognizing the impact of the parity of \( N \) on the game's outcome. If \( N \) is 1, the first player loses immediately. If \( N \) is even, the Grinch can always respond in a way that keeps him in a winning position. Conversely, if \( N \) is odd, the first player can make it even for the Grinch, leading to a win for the first player.

    The solution involved a simple function that checks the value of \( N \) and returns the winner based on these conditions. The implementation was straightforward, and the logic was sound, leading to successful test cases.

    The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def determine_winner(N):
        if N == 1:
            return "Grinch"
        if N % 2 == 0:
            return "Grinch"
        else:
            return "Me"

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        result = determine_winner(N)
        print(result)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of analyzing game theory problems through the lens of parity and strategic moves, which can simplify the decision-making process significantly.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which candidate Chef hires for the distribution task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly, while the second candidate places all apples in the box with the least apples. 

    The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) is equal to the number of apples (N), both candidates will end up with the same distribution (all apples in one box). However, if K is less than N, the distributions can differ, leading to a "NO" answer. The solution involved checking these conditions for each test case.

    The implemented solution was straightforward, iterating through the test cases and applying the logic to determine the output. The final code effectively handled the input and output requirements without any errors. 

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case
            if K == N:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        test_cases.append((N, K))

    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and how they influence the solution's logic.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

-----Output:-----
- If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
- Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
- If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
- You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
- You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 10 points : $2 \leq N \leq 6$
- 90 points :  Original Constraints. 

-----Sample Input:-----
2
3
2

-----Sample Output:-----
YES
010
001
100
NO

-----Explanation:-----
One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine if it's possible for a group of players in a tennis tournament to each win the same number of matches when every player plays against every other player exactly once. If it's possible, we also need to provide a specific arrangement of wins and losses for each player.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - If the number of players \( N \) is odd, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches because the total number of matches played will be even, and each player would need to win an integer number of matches.
   - If \( N \) is even, we can create a round-robin style win/loss matrix where each player wins against half of the other players and loses against the other half. This can be achieved by having player \( i \) win against players \( (i+1) \) to \( (i + N/2) \) (modulo \( N \)).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N = test_case
           if N is odd:
               print "NO"
           else:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Output Format**:
   The expected output format requires that for each test case, if it's possible to have a balanced win/loss scenario, we should print "YES" followed by the win/loss matrix. If it's not possible, we should print "NO". The output for each test case should be separated correctly, and the win/loss matrix should be printed in a specific format.

2. **Identifying the Problem in the Code**:
   - The code correctly identifies when \( N \) is odd and prints "NO".
   - However, when \( N \) is even, the win/loss matrix is generated, but the output format is incorrect. Specifically, the matrix rows are not being printed correctly as strings of '0's and '1's. The current implementation may not be joining the characters properly or may not be handling the output format as expected.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The matrix was initialized correctly, but the way the results were printed may not have been formatted correctly. The output should be a string of '0's and '1's for each player, and I need to ensure that the entire row is printed as a single string.
   - I also need to ensure that the output for each test case is clearly separated, especially when multiple test cases are involved.

### Revised Plan:
- Ensure that the win/loss matrix is printed correctly as a string for each player.
- Maintain the correct output format for multiple test cases.

### Revised Code:
```python
def generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 != 0:  # Check if N is odd
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            # Initialize a N x N matrix with all zeros
            results = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(1, N // 2 + 1):
                    results[i][(i + j) % N] = '1'  # Player i wins against player (i + j) % N
            for row in results:
                print(''.join(row))  # Print each row as a string of 0s and 1s

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    test_cases.append(N)

generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Changes:
- The output for each player's results is ensured to be printed as a single string of '0's and '1's.
- The overall structure remains the same, but I will double-check the output format to ensure it matches the expected results. 

Now, I will run the code again to ensure it meets the requirements.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to generate a specific pattern of numbers based on an integer input K for multiple test cases. The expected output required printing K lines for each test case, where each line consisted of alternating 1s and 0s, starting with 1.

    Initially, I misunderstood the pattern requirements and implemented a countdown pattern instead of the alternating sequence. This led to incorrect outputs that did not match the expected format. The key realization was that each line should consist of K characters, alternating between 1 and 0, with the first character determined by the line index.

    The final solution correctly implemented the logic to generate the required pattern. The code iterated through each test case, generated the appropriate lines based on the input K, and ensured proper formatting between test cases. The successful code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def generate_pattern(T):
        for t in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case
            K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case
            for i in range(K):  # For each line from 0 to K-1
                line = ""  # Initialize an empty line
                for j in range(K):  # Create a line of length K
                    if j % 2 == 0:  # If the index is even
                        line += "1"  # Append '1'
                    else:  # If the index is odd
                        line += "0"  # Append '0'
                print(line)  # Print the generated line
            if t < T - 1:  # If this is not the last test case, print a blank line
                print()  # Print a blank line to separate test cases

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    generate_pattern(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the problem requirements and ensuring that the output format aligns with expectations.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to generate a specific pattern of binary numbers based on an integer input K for multiple test cases. The output required printing K lines for each test case, with each line containing K binary numbers starting from 1.

    Initially, the code incorrectly included the binary representation of zero and started counting from 0 instead of 1. This led to incorrect outputs and formatting issues. The key mistake was in the calculation of the binary numbers, where I used `bin(i * K + j)[2:]`, which included '0' in the output.

    To fix the solution, I adjusted the calculation to start from 1 by using `bin(i * K + j + 1)[2:]`. This ensured that the binary numbers began from 1 and were formatted correctly. Additionally, I ensured that blank lines were only printed between test cases and not after the last one.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def generate_pattern(T):
        for t in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case
            K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case
            for i in range(K):  # For each line from 0 to K-1

                    binary_number = bin(i * K + j + 1)[2:]  # Convert to binary and remove '0b'
                    line.append(binary_number)  # Append the binary number to the line
                print(" ".join(line))  # Print the generated line as a space-separated string
            if t < T - 1:  # If this is not the last test case, print a blank line
                print()  # Print a blank line to separate test cases

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    generate_pattern(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing the starting point for sequences and ensuring proper output formatting, especially when dealing with multiple test cases.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] Based on the insights and corrections needed from the previous attempts, here is the revised solution for the tennis tournament problem. The code will ensure that the output format is correct and that the win/loss matrix is generated properly for even \( N \).

```python
def generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 != 0:  # Check if N is odd
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            # Initialize a N x N matrix with all zeros
            results = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(1, N // 2 + 1):
                    results[i][(i + j) % N] = '1'  # Player i wins against player (i + j) % N
            for row in results:
                print(''.join(row))  # Print each row as a string of 0s and 1s

T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    test_cases.append(N)

### Key Points:
- The function checks if \( N \) is odd and prints "NO" if it is.
- If \( N \) is even, it constructs a win/loss matrix where each player wins against half of the other players.
- Each row of the matrix is printed as a string of '0's and '1's, ensuring the correct format.
- The code reads the number of test cases and processes each case accordingly.

This should now meet the requirements and pass all tests.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

-----Output:-----
- If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
- Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
- If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
- You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
- You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 10 points : $2 \leq N \leq 6$
- 90 points :  Original Constraints. 

-----Sample Input:-----
2
3
2

-----Sample Output:-----
YES
010
001
100
NO

-----Explanation:-----
One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine if it's possible for a group of players in a tennis tournament to each win the same number of matches when every player plays against every other player exactly once. If it's possible, we also need to provide a specific arrangement of wins and losses for each player.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - If the number of players \( N \) is odd, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches because the total number of matches played will be even, and each player would need to win an integer number of matches.
   - If \( N \) is even, we can create a round-robin style win/loss matrix where each player wins against half of the other players and loses against the other half. This can be achieved by having player \( i \) win against players \( (i+1) \) to \( (i + N/2) \) (modulo \( N \)).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N = test_case
           if N is odd:
               print "NO"
           else:
               print "YES"
               initialize a N x N matrix with all zeros
               for i from 0 to N-1:
                   for j from 1 to N/2:
                       matrix[i][(i + j) % N] = 1  // player i wins against player (i + j) % N
               for each row in matrix:
                   print row as a string of 0s and 1s
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Output Format**:
   The expected output format requires that for each test case, if it's possible to have a balanced win/loss scenario, we should print "YES" followed by the win/loss matrix. If it's not possible, we should print "NO". The output for each test case should be separated correctly, and the win/loss matrix should be printed in a specific format.

2. **Identifying the Problem in the Code**:
   - The code correctly identifies when \( N \) is odd and prints "NO".
   - However, when \( N \) is even, the win/loss matrix is generated, but the output format is incorrect. Specifically, the matrix rows are not being printed correctly as strings of '0's and '1's. The current implementation may not be joining the characters properly or may not be handling the output format as expected.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The matrix was initialized correctly, but the way the results were printed may not have been formatted correctly. The output should be a string of '0's and '1's for each player, and I need to ensure that the entire row is printed as a single string.
   - I also need to ensure that the output for each test case is clearly separated, especially when multiple test cases are involved.

### Revised Plan:
- Ensure that the win/loss matrix is printed correctly as a string for each player.
- Maintain the correct output format for multiple test cases.

### Revised Code:
```python
def generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 != 0:  # Check if N is odd
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            # Initialize a N x N matrix with all zeros
            results = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(1, N // 2 + 1):
                    results[i][(i + j) % N] = '1'  # Player i wins against player (i + j) % N
            for row in results:
                print(''.join(row))  # Print each row as a string of 0s and 1s

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    test_cases.append(N)

generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Changes:
- The output for each player's results is ensured to be printed as a single string of '0's and '1's.
- The overall structure remains the same, but I will double-check the output format to ensure it matches the expected results. 

Now, I will run the code again to ensure it meets the requirements.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

-----Output:-----
- If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
- Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
- If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
- You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
- You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 10 points : $2 \leq N \leq 6$
- 90 points :  Original Constraints. 

-----Sample Input:-----
2
3
2

-----Sample Output:-----
YES
010
001
100
NO

-----Explanation:-----
One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine if it's possible for a group of players in a tennis tournament to each win the same number of matches when every player plays against every other player exactly once. If it's possible, we also need to provide a specific arrangement of wins and losses for each player.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - If the number of players \( N \) is odd, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches because the total number of matches played will be even, and each player would need to win an integer number of matches.
   - If \( N \) is even, we can create a round-robin style win/loss matrix where each player wins against half of the other players and loses against the other half. This can be achieved by having player \( i \) win against players \( (i+1) \) to \( (i + N/2) \) (modulo \( N \)).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N = test_case
           if N is odd:
               print "NO"
           else:
               print "YES"
               initialize a N x N matrix with all zeros
               for i from 0 to N-1:
                   for j from 1 to N/2:
                       matrix[i][(i + j) % N] = 1  // player i wins against player (i + j) % N
               for each row in matrix:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Output Format**:
   The expected output format requires that for each test case, if it's possible to have a balanced win/loss scenario, we should print "YES" followed by the win/loss matrix. If it's not possible, we should print "NO". The output for each test case should be separated correctly, and the win/loss matrix should be printed in a specific format.

2. **Identifying the Problem in the Code**:
   - The code correctly identifies when \( N \) is odd and prints "NO".
   - However, when \( N \) is even, the win/loss matrix is generated, but the output format is incorrect. Specifically, the matrix rows are not being printed correctly as strings of '0's and '1's. The current implementation may not be joining the characters properly or may not be handling the output format as expected.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The matrix was initialized correctly, but the way the results were printed may not have been formatted correctly. The output should be a string of '0's and '1's for each player, and I need to ensure that the entire row is printed as a single string.
   - I also need to ensure that the output for each test case is clearly separated, especially when multiple test cases are involved.

### Revised Plan:
- Ensure that the win/loss matrix is printed correctly as a string for each player.
- Maintain the correct output format for multiple test cases.

### Revised Code:
```python
def generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 != 0:  # Check if N is odd
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            # Initialize a N x N matrix with all zeros
            results = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(1, N // 2 + 1):
                    results[i][(i + j) % N] = '1'  # Player i wins against player (i + j) % N
            for row in results:
                print(''.join(row))  # Print each row as a string of 0s and 1s

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    test_cases.append(N)

generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Changes:
- The output for each player's results is ensured to be printed as a single string of '0's and '1's.
- The overall structure remains the same, but I will double-check the output format to ensure it matches the expected results. 

Now, I will run the code again to ensure it meets the requirements.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] Based on the insights and corrections needed from the previous attempts, here is the revised solution for the tennis tournament problem. The code will ensure that the output format is correct and that the win/loss matrix is generated properly for even \( N \).

```python
def generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 != 0:  # Check if N is odd
            print("NO")
        else:

test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())

### Key Points:
- The function checks if \( N \) is odd and prints "NO" if it is.
- If \( N \) is even, it constructs a win/loss matrix where each player wins against half of the other players.
- Each row of the matrix is printed as a string of '0's and '1's, ensuring the correct format.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to generate a specific pattern of numbers based on an integer input K for multiple test cases. The expected output required printing K lines for each test case, where each line consisted of alternating 1s and 0s, starting with 1.

    Initially, I misunderstood the pattern requirements and implemented a countdown pattern instead of the alternating sequence. This led to incorrect outputs that did not match the expected format. The key realization was that each line should consist of K characters, alternating between 1 and 0, with the first character determined by the line index.

    The final solution correctly implemented the logic to generate the required pattern. The code iterated through each test case, generated the appropriate lines based on the input K, and ensured proper formatting between test cases. The successful code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def generate_pattern(T):
        for t in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case
            K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case
            for i in range(K):  # For each line from 0 to K-1
                line = ""  # Initialize an empty line
                for j in range(K):  # Create a line of length K
                    if j % 2 == 0:  # If the index is even
                        line += "1"  # Append '1'
                    else:  # If the index is odd
                        line += "0"  # Append '0'
                print(line)  # Print the generated line
            if t < T - 1:  # If this is not the last test case, print a blank line
                print()  # Print a blank line to separate test cases

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    generate_pattern(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the problem requirements and ensuring that the output format aligns with expectations.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to generate a specific pattern of binary numbers based on an integer input K for multiple test cases. The output required printing K lines for each test case, with each line containing K binary numbers starting from 1.

    Initially, the code incorrectly included the binary representation of zero and started counting from 0 instead of 1. This led to incorrect outputs and formatting issues. The key mistake was in the calculation of the binary numbers, where I used `bin(i * K + j)[2:]`, which included '0' in the output.

    To fix the solution, I adjusted the calculation to start from 1 by using `bin(i * K + j + 1)[2:]`. This ensured that the binary numbers began from 1 and were formatted correctly. Additionally, I ensured that blank lines were only printed between test cases and not after the last one.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def generate_pattern(T):
        for t in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case
            K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case
            for i in range(K):  # For each line from 0 to K-1
                line = []  # Initialize an empty list to hold binary numbers
                for j in range(K):  # Create a line of K binary numbers
                    binary_number = bin(i * K + j + 1)[2:]  # Convert to binary and remove '0b'
                    line.append(binary_number)  # Append the binary number to the line
                print(" ".join(line))  # Print the generated line as a space-separated string
            if t < T - 1:  # If this is not the last test case, print a blank line
                print()  # Print a blank line to separate test cases

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    generate_pattern(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing the starting point for sequences and ensuring proper output formatting, especially when dealing with multiple test cases.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

-----Output:-----
- If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
- Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
- If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
- You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
- You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 10 points : $2 \leq N \leq 6$
- 90 points :  Original Constraints. 

-----Sample Input:-----
2
3
2

-----Sample Output:-----
YES
010
001
100
NO

-----Explanation:-----
One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine if it's possible for a group of players in a tennis tournament to each win the same number of matches when every player plays against every other player exactly once. If it's possible, we also need to provide a specific arrangement of wins and losses for each player.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - If the number of players \( N \) is odd, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches because the total number of matches played will be even, and each player would need to win an integer number of matches.
   - If \( N \) is even, we can create a round-robin style win/loss matrix where each player wins against half of the other players and loses against the other half. This can be achieved by having player \( i \) win against players \( (i+1) \) to \( (i + N/2) \) (modulo \( N \)).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N = test_case
           if N is odd:
               print "NO"
           else:
               print "YES"
               initialize a N x N matrix with all zeros
               for i from 0 to N-1:
                   for j from 1 to N/2:
                       matrix[i][(i + j) % N] = 1  // player i wins against player (i + j) % N
               for each row in matrix:

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Output Format**:
   The expected output format requires that for each test case, if it's possible to have a balanced win/loss scenario, we should print "YES" followed by the win/loss matrix. If it's not possible, we should print "NO". The output for each test case should be separated correctly, and the win/loss matrix should be printed in a specific format.

2. **Identifying the Problem in the Code**:
   - The code correctly identifies when \( N \) is odd and prints "NO".
   - However, when \( N \) is even, the win/loss matrix is generated, but the output format is incorrect. Specifically, the matrix rows are not being printed correctly as strings of '0's and '1's. The current implementation may not be joining the characters properly or may not be handling the output format as expected.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The matrix was initialized correctly, but the way the results were printed may not have been formatted correctly. The output should be a string of '0's and '1's for each player, and I need to ensure that the entire row is printed as a single string.
   - I also need to ensure that the output for each test case is clearly separated, especially when multiple test cases are involved.

### Revised Plan:
- Ensure that the win/loss matrix is printed correctly as a string for each player.
- Maintain the correct output format for multiple test cases.

### Revised Code:
```python
def generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 != 0:  # Check if N is odd
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            # Initialize a N x N matrix with all zeros
            results = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(1, N // 2 + 1):
                    results[i][(i + j) % N] = '1'  # Player i wins against player (i + j) % N
            for row in results:
                print(''.join(row))  # Print each row as a string of 0s and 1s

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    test_cases.append(N)

generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Changes:
- The output for each player's results is ensured to be printed as a single string of '0's and '1's.
- The overall structure remains the same, but I will double-check the output format to ensure it matches the expected results. 

Now, I will run the code again to ensure it meets the requirements.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] Based on the insights and corrections needed from the previous attempts, here is the revised solution for the tennis tournament problem. The code will ensure that the output format is correct and that the win/loss matrix is generated properly for even \( N \).

```python
def generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 != 0:  # Check if N is odd
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            # Initialize a N x N matrix with all zeros
            results = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(1, N // 2 + 1):
                    results[i][(i + j) % N] = '1'  # Player i wins against player (i + j) % N
            for row in results:
                print(''.join(row))  # Print each row as a string of 0s and 1s

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    test_cases.append(N)

generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Points:
- The function checks if \( N \) is odd and prints "NO" if it is.
- If \( N \) is even, it constructs a win/loss matrix where each player wins against half of the other players.
- Each row of the matrix is printed as a string of '0's and '1's, ensuring the correct format.
- The code reads the number of test cases and processes each case accordingly.

This should now meet the requirements and pass all tests.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine if it's possible for a group of players in a tennis tournament to each win the same number of matches when every player plays against every other player exactly once. If it's possible, we also need to provide a specific arrangement of wins and losses for each player.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - If the number of players \( N \) is odd, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches because the total number of matches played will be even, and each player would need to win an integer number of matches.
   - If \( N \) is even, we can create a round-robin style win/loss matrix where each player wins against half of the other players and loses against the other half. This can be achieved by having player \( i \) win against players \( (i+1) \) to \( (i + N/2) \) (modulo \( N \)).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N = test_case
           if N is odd:
               print "NO"
           else:
               print "YES"
               initialize a N x N matrix with all zeros
               for i from 0 to N-1:
                   for j from 1 to N/2:
                       matrix[i][(i + j) % N] = 1  // player i wins against player (i + j) % N
               for each row in matrix:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Output Format**:
   The expected output format requires that for each test case, if it's possible to have a balanced win/loss scenario, we should print "YES" followed by the win/loss matrix. If it's not possible, we should print "NO". The output for each test case should be separated correctly, and the win/loss matrix should be printed in a specific format.

2. **Identifying the Problem in the Code**:
   - The code correctly identifies when \( N \) is odd and prints "NO".
   - However, when \( N \) is even, the win/loss matrix is generated, but the output format is incorrect. Specifically, the matrix rows are not being printed correctly as strings of '0's and '1's. The current implementation may not be joining the characters properly or may not be handling the output format as expected.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The matrix was initialized correctly, but the way the results were printed may not have been formatted correctly. The output should be a string of '0's and '1's for each player, and I need to ensure that the entire row is printed as a single string.
   - I also need to ensure that the output for each test case is clearly separated, especially when multiple test cases are involved.

### Revised Plan:
- Ensure that the win/loss matrix is printed correctly as a string for each player.
- Maintain the correct output format for multiple test cases.

### Revised Code:
```python
def generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 != 0:  # Check if N is odd
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            # Initialize a N x N matrix with all zeros
            results = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(1, N // 2 + 1):
                    results[i][(i + j) % N] = '1'  # Player i wins against player (i + j) % N
            for row in results:
                print(''.join(row))  # Print each row as a string of 0s and 1s

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    test_cases.append(N)

generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Changes:
- The output for each player's results is ensured to be printed as a single string of '0's and '1's.
- The overall structure remains the same, but I will double-check the output format to ensure it matches the expected results. 

Now, I will run the code again to ensure it meets the requirements.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] Based on the insights and corrections needed from the previous attempts, here is the revised solution for the tennis tournament problem. The code will ensure that the output format is correct and that the win/loss matrix is generated properly for even \( N \).

```python
def generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 != 0:  # Check if N is odd
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            # Initialize a N x N matrix with all zeros
            results = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(1, N // 2 + 1):

T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):

### Key Points:
- The function checks if \( N \) is odd and prints "NO" if it is.
- If \( N \) is even, it constructs a win/loss matrix where each player wins against half of the other players.
- Each row of the matrix is printed as a string of '0's and '1's, ensuring the correct format.
- The code reads the number of test cases and processes each case accordingly.

This should now meet the requirements and pass all tests.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to generate a specific pattern of numbers based on an integer input K for multiple test cases. The expected output required printing K lines for each test case, where each line consisted of alternating 1s and 0s, starting with 1.

    Initially, I misunderstood the pattern requirements and implemented a countdown pattern instead of the alternating sequence. This led to incorrect outputs that did not match the expected format. The key realization was that each line should consist of K characters, alternating between 1 and 0, with the first character determined by the line index.

    The final solution correctly implemented the logic to generate the required pattern. The code iterated through each test case, generated the appropriate lines based on the input K, and ensured proper formatting between test cases. The successful code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def generate_pattern(T):
        for t in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case
            K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case
            for i in range(K):  # For each line from 0 to K-1
                line = ""  # Initialize an empty line
                for j in range(K):  # Create a line of length K
                    if j % 2 == 0:  # If the index is even
                        line += "1"  # Append '1'
                    else:  # If the index is odd
                        line += "0"  # Append '0'
                print(line)  # Print the generated line
            if t < T - 1:  # If this is not the last test case, print a blank line
                print()  # Print a blank line to separate test cases

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    generate_pattern(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the problem requirements and ensuring that the output format aligns with expectations.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to generate a specific pattern of binary numbers based on an integer input K for multiple test cases. The output required printing K lines for each test case, with each line containing K binary numbers starting from 1.

    Initially, the code incorrectly included the binary representation of zero and started counting from 0 instead of 1. This led to incorrect outputs and formatting issues. The key mistake was in the calculation of the binary numbers, where I used `bin(i * K + j)[2:]`, which included '0' in the output.

    To fix the solution, I adjusted the calculation to start from 1 by using `bin(i * K + j + 1)[2:]`. This ensured that the binary numbers began from 1 and were formatted correctly. Additionally, I ensured that blank lines were only printed between test cases and not after the last one.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def generate_pattern(T):
        for t in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case
            K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case
            for i in range(K):  # For each line from 0 to K-1
                line = []  # Initialize an empty list to hold binary numbers
                for j in range(K):  # Create a line of K binary numbers
                    binary_number = bin(i * K + j + 1)[2:]  # Convert to binary and remove '0b'
                    line.append(binary_number)  # Append the binary number to the line
                print(" ".join(line))  # Print the generated line as a space-separated string
            if t < T - 1:  # If this is not the last test case, print a blank line
                print()  # Print a blank line to separate test cases

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    generate_pattern(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing the starting point for sequences and ensuring proper output formatting, especially when dealing with multiple test cases.

 Based on the previous analysis and the feedback received, I will revise the solution to ensure that the output format is correct and that the win/loss matrix is generated properly for even \( N \). 

Here’s the corrected code:

```python
def generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 != 0:  # Check if N is odd
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            # Initialize a N x N matrix with all zeros
            results = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(1, N // 2 + 1):
                    results[i][(i + j) % N] = '1'  # Player i wins against player (i + j) % N
            for row in results:
                print(''.join(row))  # Print each row as a string of 0s and 1s

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    test_cases.append(N)

generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Points:
- The function checks if \( N \) is odd and prints "NO" if it is.
- If \( N \) is even, it constructs a win/loss matrix where each player wins against half of the other players.
- Each row of the matrix is printed as a string of '0's and '1's, ensuring the correct format.
- The code reads the number of test cases and processes each case accordingly.

This code should now meet the requirements and pass all tests.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

-----Output:-----
- If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
- Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
- If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
- You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
- You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 10 points : $2 \leq N \leq 6$
- 90 points :  Original Constraints. 

-----Sample Input:-----
2
3
2

-----Sample Output:-----
YES
010
001
100
NO

-----Explanation:-----
One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine if it's possible for a group of players in a tennis tournament to each win the same number of matches when every player plays against every other player exactly once. If it's possible, we also need to provide a specific arrangement of wins and losses for each player.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - If the number of players \( N \) is odd, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches because the total number of matches played will be even, and each player would need to win an integer number of matches.
   - If \( N \) is even, we can create a round-robin style win/loss matrix where each player wins against half of the other players and loses against the other half. This can be achieved by having player \( i \) win against players \( (i+1) \) to \( (i + N/2) \) (modulo \( N \)).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N = test_case
           if N is odd:
               print "NO"
           else:
               print "YES"
               initialize a N x N matrix with all zeros
               for i from 0 to N-1:
                   for j from 1 to N/2:
                       matrix[i][(i + j) % N] = 1  // player i wins against player (i + j) % N
               for each row in matrix:

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Output Format**:
   The expected output format requires that for each test case, if it's possible to have a balanced win/loss scenario, we should print "YES" followed by the win/loss matrix. If it's not possible, we should print "NO". The output for each test case should be separated correctly, and the win/loss matrix should be printed in a specific format.

2. **Identifying the Problem in the Code**:
   - The code correctly identifies when \( N \) is odd and prints "NO".
   - However, when \( N \) is even, the win/loss matrix is generated, but the output format is incorrect. Specifically, the matrix rows are not being printed correctly as strings of '0's and '1's. The current implementation may not be joining the characters properly or may not be handling the output format as expected.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The matrix was initialized correctly, but the way the results were printed may not have been formatted correctly. The output should be a string of '0's and '1's for each player, and I need to ensure that the entire row is printed as a single string.
   - I also need to ensure that the output for each test case is clearly separated, especially when multiple test cases are involved.

### Revised Plan:
- Ensure that the win/loss matrix is printed correctly as a string for each player.
- Maintain the correct output format for multiple test cases.

### Revised Code:
```python
def generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 != 0:  # Check if N is odd
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            # Initialize a N x N matrix with all zeros
            results = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(1, N // 2 + 1):
                    results[i][(i + j) % N] = '1'  # Player i wins against player (i + j) % N
            for row in results:
                print(''.join(row))  # Print each row as a string of 0s and 1s

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    test_cases.append(N)

generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Changes:
- The output for each player's results is ensured to be printed as a single string of '0's and '1's.
- The overall structure remains the same, but I will double-check the output format to ensure it matches the expected results. 

Now, I will run the code again to ensure it meets the requirements.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] Based on the previous analysis and the feedback received, I will revise the solution to ensure that the output format is correct and that the win/loss matrix is generated properly for even \( N \). 

Here’s the corrected code:

```python
def generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 != 0:  # Check if N is odd
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            # Initialize a N x N matrix with all zeros
            results = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(1, N // 2 + 1):
                    results[i][(i + j) % N] = '1'  # Player i wins against player (i + j) % N
            for row in results:
                print(''.join(row))  # Print each row as a string of 0s and 1s

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    test_cases.append(N)

generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Points:
- The function checks if \( N \) is odd and prints "NO" if it is.
- If \( N \) is even, it constructs a win/loss matrix where each player wins against half of the other players.
- Each row of the matrix is printed as a string of '0's and '1's, ensuring the correct format.
- The code reads the number of test cases and processes each case accordingly.

This code should now meet the requirements and pass all tests.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine if a tennis tournament with \( N \) players could be structured such that each player wins the same number of matches. The key insights were that if \( N \) is odd, it's impossible to achieve this, while if \( N \) is even, a round-robin style win/loss matrix can be constructed.

The initial attempts focused on generating the win/loss matrix correctly, but the output format was not aligned with the requirements. Specifically, the matrix rows were not being printed as complete strings of '0's and '1's, leading to incorrect outputs. 

The correct approach involved initializing a matrix of size \( N \times N \) filled with '0's and then updating the matrix to reflect wins for each player against half of the other players. The final output needed to ensure that each row was printed as a single string.

Despite multiple revisions, the output formatting issues persisted, indicating a need for careful attention to how results are printed. The final code structure was correct, but the output still did not match the expected format, highlighting the importance of precise output handling in competitive programming.

Key learning points include:
- The necessity of clear output formatting in programming challenges.
- The importance of understanding the problem constraints and how they affect the solution structure.
- The need for thorough testing against expected outputs to catch formatting errors.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

-----Output:-----
- If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
- Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
- If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
- You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
- You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 10 points : $2 \leq N \leq 6$
- 90 points :  Original Constraints. 

-----Sample Input:-----
2
3
2

-----Sample Output:-----
YES
010
001
100
NO

-----Explanation:-----
One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine if it's possible for a group of players in a tennis tournament to each win the same number of matches when every player plays against every other player exactly once. If it's possible, we also need to provide a specific arrangement of wins and losses for each player.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - If the number of players \( N \) is odd, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches because the total number of matches played will be even, and each player would need to win an integer number of matches.
   - If \( N \) is even, we can create a round-robin style win/loss matrix where each player wins against half of the other players and loses against the other half. This can be achieved by having player \( i \) win against players \( (i+1) \) to \( (i + N/2) \) (modulo \( N \)).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N = test_case
           if N is odd:
               print "NO"
           else:
               print "YES"

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Output Format**:
   The expected output format requires that for each test case, if it's possible to have a balanced win/loss scenario, we should print "YES" followed by the win/loss matrix. If it's not possible, we should print "NO". The output for each test case should be separated correctly, and the win/loss matrix should be printed in a specific format.

2. **Identifying the Problem in the Code**:
   - The code correctly identifies when \( N \) is odd and prints "NO".
   - However, when \( N \) is even, the win/loss matrix is generated, but the output format is incorrect. Specifically, the matrix rows are not being printed correctly as strings of '0's and '1's. The current implementation may not be joining the characters properly or may not be handling the output format as expected.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The matrix was initialized correctly, but the way the results were printed may not have been formatted correctly. The output should be a string of '0's and '1's for each player, and I need to ensure that the entire row is printed as a single string.
   - I also need to ensure that the output for each test case is clearly separated, especially when multiple test cases are involved.

### Revised Plan:
- Ensure that the win/loss matrix is printed correctly as a string for each player.
- Maintain the correct output format for multiple test cases.

### Revised Code:
```python
def generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 != 0:  # Check if N is odd
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            # Initialize a N x N matrix with all zeros
            results = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            for i in range(N):
                for j in range(1, N // 2 + 1):
                    results[i][(i + j) % N] = '1'  # Player i wins against player (i + j) % N
            for row in results:
                print(''.join(row))  # Print each row as a string of 0s and 1s

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    test_cases.append(N)

generate_tournament_results(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Changes:
- The output for each player's results is ensured to be printed as a single string of '0's and '1's.
- The overall structure remains the same, but I will double-check the output format to ensure it matches the expected results. 

Now, I will run the code again to ensure it meets the requirements.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

In my attempts to solve the problem, I initially focused on generating a win/loss matrix for a tennis tournament based on the number of players \( N \). My approach was to check if \( N \) was odd or even and then construct the matrix accordingly. However, I overlooked the requirement that if \( N \) is odd, the output should be "NO", and if \( N \) is even, the output should be "YES" followed by the matrix. 

The official solution provided a clearer and more effective approach. It correctly identifies that if \( N \) is even, it should print "NO" instead of "YES". The official solution also constructs the win/loss matrix in a more straightforward manner by using a list to track wins for each player and then converting that list to a string for output. 

Key insights from the official solution:
1. **Odd vs. Even Check**: The solution correctly identifies that if \( N \) is odd, it should print "NO" and if even, it should proceed to generate the matrix.
2. **Matrix Construction**: The official solution uses a simple list to count wins for each player, which is more efficient and easier to understand than my previous approach.
3. **Output Formatting**: The solution constructs the output string in a single pass, ensuring that the format is correct.

Overall, the official solution is more concise and directly addresses the problem requirements, highlighting the importance of careful output formatting and logical flow in problem-solving.
INFO - Updated entry: In this problem, the goal was to determine if a tennis tournament with \( N \) players could be structured such that each player wins the same number of matches. The key insights were that if \( N \) is odd, it's impossible to achieve this, while if \( N \) is even, a round-robin style win/loss m...,
