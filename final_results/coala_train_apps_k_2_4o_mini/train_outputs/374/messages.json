i < S.size(); i++)\n            sa_extend(S[i]);\n \n        int v = 0, l = 0, best = 0, bestpos = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < T.size(); i++) {\n            while (v && !st[v].next.count(T[i])) {\n                v = st[v].link ;\n                l = st[v].len;\n            }\n            if (st[v].next.count(T[i])) {\n                v = st [v].next[T[i]];\n                l++;\n            }\n            if (l > best) {\n                best = l;\n                bestpos = i;\n            }\n        }\n        return T.substr(bestpos - best + 1, best);\n    } \n    ```\n\n    ### Largest common substring of multiple strings\n\n    There are $k$ strings $S_i$ given.\n    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in each string $S_i$.\n\n    We join all strings into one large string $T$, separating the strings by a special characters $D_i$ (one for each string):\n\n    $$T = S_1 + D_1 + S_2 + D_2 + \\dots + S_k + D_k.$$\n\n    Then we construct the suffix automaton for the string $T$.\n\n    Now we need to find a string in the machine, which is contained in all the strings $S_i$, and this can be done by using the special added characters.\n    Note that if a substring is included in some string $S_j$, then in the suffix automaton exists a path starting from this substring containing the character $D_j$ and not containing the other characters $D_1, \\dots, D_{j-1}, D_{j+1}, \\dots, D_k$.\n\n    Thus we need to calculate the attainability, which tells us for each state of the machine and each symbol $D_i$ if there exists such a path.\n    This can easily be computed by DFS or BFS and dynamic programming.\n    After that, the answer to the problem will be the string $longest(v)$ for the state $v$, from which the paths were exists for all special characters.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution employs a set-based dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of minimizing the weight of the last remaining rock. The key insights from this solution are as follows:\n\n    1. **Set for Achievable Sums**: Instead of using a boolean array to track achievable sums, the official solution uses a set `dp` to store all possible sums that can be formed with the given rock weights. This allows for more flexibility and avoids the need for a fixed size array.\n\n    2. **Iterative Sum Calculation**: For each rock weight, the solution updates the set `dp` by adding the current stone's weight to each of the sums already in the set. This effectively generates all possible sums that can be formed with the rocks processed so far.\n\n    3. **Final Calculation**: After processing all rocks, the solution calculates the minimum possible weight of the last stone by evaluating the absolute difference between the total weight and twice each sum in the set. This is based on the idea that the remaining weight can be derived from the difference between the total weight and the sum of one of the partitions.\n\n    4. **Efficiency**: The use of a set allows for dynamic growth of achievable sums without the constraints of a fixed array size, making the solution both space-efficient and straightforward.\n\n    In contrast, my initial approach used a boolean array which, while effective, could be less efficient in terms of space and did not leverage the flexibility of a set to dynamically track achievable sums. The official solution's method of directly calculating the minimum weight from the set of sums is also more elegant and concise. Overall, the official solution provides a more optimal and clear approach to the problem.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

        "content": "### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1. **Understanding the Requirements**: The goal is to find the shortest superstring that contains all the input strings as substrings. The output can be any valid shortest superstring, not necessarily in the order of the input strings.\n\n2. **Identifying the Issue**: The previous implementation generates all permutations of the input strings and merges them based on the maximum overlap. However, it seems that the merging logic may not be correctly handling overlaps, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases.\n\n3. **Overlap Calculation**: The overlap calculation in the `merge_strings` function only checks for overlaps from the end of the first string to the beginning of the second string. It does not account for overlaps in the reverse direction or for cases where the second string might overlap with the first string in a different way.\n\n4. **Permutations and Merging**: While generating permutations is a valid approach, the merging logic needs to be robust enough to ensure that all possible overlaps are considered. The current implementation may not be merging strings optimally, leading to longer superstrings than necessary.\n\n### Step-by-step Identification of Mistakes\n\n1. **Merging Logic**: The merging logic needs to be improved to ensure that it checks for overlaps in both directions (i.e., from the end of one string to the start of another and vice versa).\n\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The implementation should also consider edge cases where strings may have partial overlaps that are not being captured correctly.\n\n3. **Output Requirements**: The output should be any valid shortest superstring, but the current implementation may not be generating all possible valid combinations due to the way overlaps are calculated.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo fix the code, I will:\n- Revise the overlap calculation to ensure it checks for overlaps in both directions.\n- Ensure that the merging process is robust and captures all possible overlaps.\n- Maintain the overall structure of generating permutations but improve the merging logic to ensure correctness.\n\nNow, I will implement the revised solution. \n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestSuperstring(self, A: list[str]) -> str:\n        from itertools import permutations\n        \n        # Function to merge two strings with maximum overlap\n        def merge_strings(s1, s2):\n            max_overlap = 0\n            # Find maximum overlap length from s1 to s2\n            for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):\n                if s1[i-1:] == s2[:len(s1) - i + 1]:\n                    max_overlap = len(s1) - i + 1\n            # Find maximum overlap length from s2 to s1\n            for i in range(1, len(s2) + 1):\n                if s2[i-1:] == s1[:len(s2) - i + 1]:\n                    max_overlap = max(max_overlap, len(s2) - i + 1)\n            # Merge the strings based on the maximum overlap found\n            return s1 + s2[max_overlap:]\n\n        shortest_string = \"\"\n        \n        # Generate all permutations of the input list\n        for perm in permutations(A):\n            merged_string = perm[0]\n            # Merge all strings in the current permutation\n            for i in range(1, len(perm)):\n                merged_string = merge_strings(merged_string, perm[i])\n            # Update the shortest string found\n            if shortest_string == \"\" or len(merged_string) < len(shortest_string):\n                shortest_string = merged_string\n        \n        return shortest_string\n```"

We then sum up these totals for each state $v \\neq t_0$ in the automaton.

i < S.size(); i++)\n            sa_extend(S[i]);\n \n        int v = 0, l = 0, best = 0, bestpos = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < T.size(); i++) {\n            while (v && !st[v].next.count(T[i])) {\n                v = st[v].link ;\n                l = st[v].len;\n            }\n            if (st[v].next.count(T[i])) {\n                v = st [v].next[T[i]];\n                l++;\n            }\n            if (l > best) {\n                best = l;\n                bestpos = i;\n            }\n        }\n        return T.substr(bestpos - best + 1, best);\n    } \n    ```\n\n    ### Largest common substring of multiple strings\n\n    There are $k$ strings $S_i$ given.\n    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in each string $S_i$.\n\n    We join all strings into one large string $T$, separating the strings by a special characters $D_i$ (one for each string):\n\n    $$T = S_1 + D_1 + S_2 + D_2 + \\dots + S_k + D_k.$$\n\n    Then we construct the suffix automaton for the string $T$.\n\n    Now we need to find a string in the machine, which is contained in all the strings $S_i$, and this can be done by using the special added characters.\n    Note that if a substring is included in some string $S_j$, then in the suffix automaton exists a path starting from this substring containing the character $D_j$ and not containing the other characters $D_1, \\dots, D_{j-1}, D_{j+1}, \\dots, D_k$.\n\n    Thus we need to calculate the attainability, which tells us for each state of the machine and each symbol $D_i$ if there exists such a path.\n    This can easily be computed by DFS or BFS and dynamic programming.\n    After that, the answer to the problem will be the string $longest(v)$ for the state $v$, from which the paths were exists for all special characters.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

        "content": "### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1. **Understanding the Requirements**: The task is to find the shortest superstring that contains all the input strings as substrings. The output can be any valid shortest superstring, not necessarily in the order of the input strings.\n\n2. **Identifying the Issue**: The previous implementation generates all permutations of the input strings and merges them based on the maximum overlap. However, it seems that the merging logic may not be correctly handling overlaps, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases.\n\n3. **Overlap Calculation**: The overlap calculation in the `merge_strings` function only checks for overlaps from the end of the first string to the beginning of the second string. It does not account for overlaps in the reverse direction or for cases where the second string might overlap with the first string in a different way.\n\n4. **Permutations and Merging**: While generating permutations is a valid approach, the merging logic needs to be robust enough to ensure that all possible overlaps are considered. The current implementation may not be merging strings optimally, leading to longer superstrings than necessary.\n\n### Step-by-step Identification of Mistakes\n\n1. **Merging Logic**: The merging logic needs to be improved to ensure that it checks for overlaps in both directions. The current implementation may not be merging strings optimally, leading to longer superstrings than necessary.\n\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The implementation should also consider edge cases where strings may have partial overlaps that are not being captured correctly.\n\n3. **Output Requirements**: The output should be any valid shortest superstring, but the current implementation may not be generating all possible valid combinations due to the way overlaps are calculated.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo fix the code, I will:\n- Revise the overlap calculation to ensure it checks for overlaps in both directions.\n- Ensure that the merging process is robust and captures all possible overlaps.\n- Maintain the overall structure of generating permutations but improve the merging logic to ensure correctness.\n\nNow, I will implement the revised solution. \n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestSuperstring(self, A: list[str]) -> str:\n        from itertools import permutations\n        \n        # Function to merge two strings with maximum overlap\n        def merge_strings(s1, s2):\n            max_overlap = 0\n            # Find maximum overlap length from s1 to s2\n            for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):\n                if s1[i-1:] == s2[:len(s1) - i + 1]:\n                    max_overlap = len(s1) - i + 1\n            # Find maximum overlap length from s2 to s1\n            for i in range(1, len(s2) + 1):\n                if s2[i-1:] == s1[:len(s2) - i + 1]:\n                    max_overlap = max(max_overlap, len(s2) - i + 1)\n            # Merge the strings based on the maximum overlap found\n            return s1 + s2[max_overlap:]\n\n        shortest_string = \"\"\n        \n        # Generate all permutations of the input list\n        for perm in permutations(A):\n            merged_string = perm[0]\n            # Merge all strings in the current permutation\n            for i in range(1, len(perm)):\n                merged_string = merge_strings(merged_string, perm[i])\n            # Update the shortest string found\n            if shortest_string == \"\" or len(merged_string) < len(shortest_string):\n                shortest_string = merged_string\n        \n        return shortest_string\n```"

The output can be any valid shortest superstring, not necessarily in the order of the input strings.\n\n2. **Identifying the Issue**: The previous implementation generates all permutations of the input strings and merges them based on the maximum overlap. However, it seems that the merging logic may not be correctly handling overlaps, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases.\n\n3. **Overlap Calculation**: The overlap calculation in the `merge_strings` function only checks for overlaps from the end of the first string to the beginning of the second string. It does not account for overlaps in the reverse direction or for cases where the second string might overlap with the first string in a different way.\n\n4. **Permutations and Merging**: While generating permutations is a valid approach, the merging logic needs to be robust enough to ensure that all possible overlaps are considered. The current implementation may not be merging strings optimally, leading to longer superstrings than necessary.\n\n### Step-by-step Identification of Mistakes\n\n1. **Merging Logic**: The merging logic needs to be improved to ensure that it checks for overlaps in both directions. The current implementation may not be merging strings optimally, leading to longer superstrings than necessary.\n\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The implementation should also consider edge cases where strings may have partial overlaps that are not being captured correctly.\n\n3. **Output Requirements**: The output should be any valid shortest superstring, but the current implementation may not be generating all possible valid combinations due to the way overlaps are calculated.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo fix the code, I will:\n- Revise the overlap calculation to ensure it checks for overlaps in both directions.\n- Ensure that the merging process is robust and captures all possible overlaps.\n- Maintain the overall structure of generating permutations but improve the merging logic to ensure correctness.\n\nNow, I will implement the revised solution. \n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestSuperstring(self, A: list[str]) -> str:\n        from itertools import permutations\n        \n        # Function to merge two strings with maximum overlap\n        def merge_strings(s1, s2):\n            max_overlap = 0\n            # Find maximum overlap length from s1 to s2\n            for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):\n                if s1[i-1:] == s2[:len(s1) - i + 1]:\n                    max_overlap = len(s1) - i + 1\n            # Find maximum overlap length from s2 to s1\n            for i in range(1, len(s2) + 1):\n                if s2[i-1:] == s1[:len(s2) - i + 1]:\n                    max_overlap = max(max_overlap, len(s2) - i + 1)\n            # Merge the strings based on the maximum overlap found\n            return s1 + s2[max_overlap:]\n\n        shortest_string = \"\"\n        \n        # Generate all permutations of the input list\n        for perm in permutations(A):\n            merged_string = perm[0]\n            # Merge all strings in the current permutation\n            for i in range(1, len(perm)):\n                merged_string = merge_strings(merged_string, perm[i])\n            # Update the shortest string found\n            if shortest_string == \"\" or len(merged_string) < len(shortest_string):\n                shortest_string = merged_string\n        \n        return shortest_string\n```"

We then sum up these totals for each state $v \\neq t_0$ in the automaton. This is shown by the code below:\n\n    ```cpp\n    long long get_tot_len_diff_substings() {\n        long long tot = 0;\n        for(int i = 1; i < sz; i++) {\n            long long shortest = st[st[i].link].len + 1;\n            long long longest = st[i].len;\n        \n            long long num_strings = longest - shortest + 1;\n            long long cur = num_strings * (longest + shortest) / 2;\n            tot += cur;\n        }\n        return tot;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Suffix Automaton\n    Part: 7/7\n    ```\n\n    ### Shortest non-appearing string\n\n    Given a string $S$ and a certain alphabet.\n    We have to find a string of smallest length, that doesn't appear in $S$.\n\n    We will apply dynamic programming on the suffix automaton built for the string $S$.\n\n    Let $d[v]$ be the answer for the node $v$, i.e. we already processed part of the substring, are currently in the state $v$, and want to find the smallest number of characters that have to be added to find a non-existent transition.\n    Computing $d[v]$ is very simple.\n    If there is not transition using at least one character of the alphabet, then $d[v] = 1$.\n    Otherwise one character is not enough, and so we need to take the minimum of all answers of all transitions:\n\n    $$d[v] = 1 + \\min_{w:(v,w,c) \\in SA} d[w].$$\n\n    The answer to the problem will be $d[t_0]$, and the actual string can be restored using the computed array $d[]$.\n\n    ### Longest common substring of two strings\n\n    Given two strings $S$ and $T$.\n    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in $S$ and also in $T$.\n\n    We construct a suffix automaton for the string $S$.\n\n    We will now take the string $T$, and for each prefix look for the longest suffix of this prefix in $S$.\n    In other words, for each position in the string $T$, we want to find the longest common substring of $S$ and $T$ ending in that position.\n\n    For this we will use two variables, the **current state** $v$, and the **current length** $l$.\n    These two variables will describe the current matching part: its length and the state that corresponds to it.\n\n    Initially $v = t_0$ and $l = 0$, i.e. the match is empty.\n\n    Now let us describe how we can add a character $T[i]$ and recalculate the answer for it.\n\n      - If there is a transition from $v$ with the character $T[i]$, then we simply follow the transition and increase $l$ by one.\n      - If there is no such transition, we have to shorten the current matching part, which means that we need to follow the suffix link: $v = link(v)$.\n        At the same time, the current length has to be shortened.\n        Obviously we need to assign $l = len(v)$, since after passing through the suffix link we end up in state whose corresponding longest string is a substring.\n      - If there is still no transition using the required character, we repeat and again go through the suffix link and decrease $l$, until we find a transition or we reach the fictional state $-1$ (which means that the symbol $T[i]$ doesn't appear at all in $S$, so we assign $v = l = 0$).\n\n    The answer to the task will be the maximum of all the values $l$.\n\n    The complexity of this part is $O(length(T))$, since in one move we can either increase $l$ by one, or make several passes through the suffix links, each one ends up reducing the value $l$.\n\n    Implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    string lcs (string S, string T) {\n        sa_init();\n        for (int i = 0; i < S.size(); i++)\n            sa_extend(S[i]);\n \n        int v = 0, l = 0, best = 0, bestpos = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < T.size(); i++) {\n            while (v && !st[v].next.count(T[i])) {\n                v = st[v].link ;\n                l = st[v].len;\n            }\n            if (st[v].next.count(T[i])) {\n                v = st [v].next[T[i]];\n                l++;\n            }\n            if (l > best) {\n                best = l;\n                bestpos = i;\n            }\n        }\n        return T.substr(bestpos - best + 1, best);\n    } \n    ```\n\n    ### Largest common substring of multiple strings\n\n    There are $k$ strings $S_i$ given.\n    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in each string $S_i$.\n\n    We join all strings into one large string $T$, separating the strings by a special characters $D_i$ (one for each string):\n\n    $$T = S_1 + D_1 + S_2 + D_2 + \\dots + S_k + D_k.$$\n\n    Then we construct the suffix automaton for the string $T$.\n\n    Now we need to find a string in the machine, which is contained in all the strings $S_i$, and this can be done by using the special added characters.\n    Note that if a substring is included in some string $S_j$, then in the suffix automaton exists a path starting from this substring containing the character $D_j$ and not containing the other characters $D_1, \\dots, D_{j-1}, D_{j+1}, \\dots, D_k$.\n\n    Thus we need to calculate the attainability, which tells us for each state of the machine and each symbol $D_i$ if there exists such a path.\n    This can easily be computed by DFS or BFS and dynamic programming.\n    After that, the answer to the problem will be the string $longest(v)$ for the state $v$, from which the paths were exists for all special characters.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

However, I failed to account for all possible overlaps effectively, particularly in both directions. The official solution uses a more systematic approach to merging strings by checking for overlaps in a more controlled manner, ensuring that the resulting string is minimized.\n\n2. **Memoization**: The official solution employs memoization to cache results of previously computed states, which significantly optimizes the recursive function that builds the superstring. This technique reduces redundant calculations and improves efficiency, especially given the potential exponential number of combinations. My approach did not utilize memoization, leading to repeated calculations and inefficiencies.\n\n3. **Filtering Redundant Strings**: The official solution begins by filtering out any strings that are substrings of others, which simplifies the problem space. This step is crucial as it reduces the number of strings to consider, making the subsequent merging and searching more efficient. My implementation did not include this optimization, which could lead to unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Recursive Structure**: The official solution uses a recursive function to explore combinations of strings, which is more elegant and manageable than the permutation approach I initially took. This recursive structure, combined with memoization, allows for a clearer and more efficient exploration of possible superstrings.\n\n### Key Code Snippets from the Official Solution\n- **Merge Function**: Efficiently merges two strings based on the maximum overlap.\n  ```python\n  def merge(w1, w2):\n      for k in range(len(w2), -1, -1):\n          if w1.endswith(w2[:k]):\n              return w1 + w2[k:]\n  ```\n\n- **Memoization Decorator**: Caches results of the recursive function to avoid redundant calculations.\n  ```python\n  def memo(f):\n      dic = {}\n      def f_alt(*args):\n          if args not in dic:\n              dic[args] = f(*args)\n          return dic[args]\n      return f_alt\n  ```\n\n- **Recursive Function to Find Shortest Superstring**: Explores combinations of strings while leveraging memoization.\n  ```python\n  @memo\n  def find_short(tup, last):\n      if len(tup) == 1:\n          return A[tup[0]]\n      mtup = tuple(t for t in tup if t != last)\n      return min((merge(find_short(mtup, t), A[last]) for t in mtup), key=len)\n  ```\n\nOverall, the official solution's approach is more efficient and systematic, leveraging memoization and careful overlap handling to ensure optimal performance. This experience has highlighted the importance of considering optimizations and the structure of the solution when tackling complex problems."
