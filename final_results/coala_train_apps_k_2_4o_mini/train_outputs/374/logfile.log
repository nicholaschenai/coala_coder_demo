INFO - [Task id] 374 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the shortest string that can be formed by concatenating a list of strings, such that each string in the list appears as a substring in the final result. The strings in the list are unique and none of them is a substring of another.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach to generate all possible permutations of the strings. For each permutation, we will concatenate the strings while ensuring that we minimize the length of the resulting string. We will check how much overlap exists between the end of one string and the beginning of the next string in the permutation to reduce the total length. Finally, we will keep track of the shortest string found during this process.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function shortestSuperstring(A):
       initialize shortest_string as an empty string
       for each permutation of A:
           initialize current_string as the first string in the permutation
           for each string in the permutation (starting from the second):
               calculate overlap between current_string and the next string
               concatenate the next string to current_string using the overlap
           if current_string is shorter than shortest_string or shortest_string is empty:
               update shortest_string to current_string
       return shortest_string
   ```

    ### Shortest non-appearing string

    Given a string $S$ and a certain alphabet.
    We have to find a string of smallest length, that doesn't appear in $S$.

    We will apply dynamic programming on the suffix automaton built for the string $S$.

    Let $d[v]$ be the answer for the node $v$, i.e. we already processed part of the substring, are currently in the state $v$, and want to find the smallest number of characters that have to be added to find a non-existent transition.
    Computing $d[v]$ is very simple.
    If there is not transition using at least one character of the alphabet, then $d[v] = 1$.
    Otherwise one character is not enough, and so we need to take the minimum of all answers of all transitions:

    $$d[v] = 1 + \min_{w:(v,w,c) \in SA} d[w].$$

    The answer to the problem will be $d[t_0]$, and the actual string can be restored using the computed array $d[]$.

    ### Longest common substring of two strings

    Given two strings $S$ and $T$.
    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in $S$ and also in $T$.

    We construct a suffix automaton for the string $S$.

    We will now take the string $T$, and for each prefix look for the longest suffix of this prefix in $S$.
    In other words, for each position in the string $T$, we want to find the longest common substring of $S$ and $T$ ending in that position.

    For this we will use two variables, the **current state** $v$, and the **current length** $l$.
    These two variables will describe the current matching part: its length and the state that corresponds to it.

    Initially $v = t_0$ and $l = 0$, i.e. the match is empty.

    Now let us describe how we can add a character $T[i]$ and recalculate the answer for it.

      - If there is a transition from $v$ with the character $T[i]$, then we simply follow the transition and increase $l$ by one.
      - If there is no such transition, we have to shorten the current matching part, which means that we need to follow the suffix link: $v = link(v)$.
        At the same time, the current length has to be shortened.
        Obviously we need to assign $l = len(v)$, since after passing through the suffix link we end up in state whose corresponding longest string is a substring.
      - If there is still no transition using the required character, we repeat and again go through the suffix link and decrease $l$, until we find a transition or we reach the fictional state $-1$ (which means that the symbol $T[i]$ doesn't appear at all in $S$, so we assign $v = l = 0$).

    The answer to the task will be the maximum of all the values $l$.

    The complexity of this part is $O(length(T))$, since in one move we can either increase $l$ by one, or make several passes through the suffix links, each one ends up reducing the value $l$.

    Implementation:

    ```cpp
    string lcs (string S, string T) {
        sa_init();
        for (int i = 0; i < S.size(); i++)
            sa_extend(S[i]);
 
        int v = 0, l = 0, best = 0, bestpos = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < T.size(); i++) {
            while (v && !st[v].next.count(T[i])) {
                v = st[v].link ;
                l = st[v].len;
            }
            if (st[v].next.count(T[i])) {
                v = st [v].next[T[i]];
                l++;
            }
            if (l > best) {
                best = l;
                bestpos = i;
            }
        }
        return T.substr(bestpos - best + 1, best);
    } 
    ```

    ### Largest common substring of multiple strings

    There are $k$ strings $S_i$ given.
    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in each string $S_i$.

    We join all strings into one large string $T$, separating the strings by a special characters $D_i$ (one for each string):

    $$T = S_1 + D_1 + S_2 + D_2 + \dots + S_k + D_k.$$

    Then we construct the suffix automaton for the string $T$.

    Now we need to find a string in the machine, which is contained in all the strings $S_i$, and this can be done by using the special added characters.
    Note that if a substring is included in some string $S_j$, then in the suffix automaton exists a path starting from this substring containing the character $D_j$ and not containing the other characters $D_1, \dots, D_{j-1}, D_{j+1}, \dots, D_k$.

    Thus we need to calculate the attainability, which tells us for each state of the machine and each symbol $D_i$ if there exists such a path.
    This can easily be computed by DFS or BFS and dynamic programming.
    After that, the answer to the problem will be the string $longest(v)$ for the state $v$, from which the paths were exists for all special characters.

[Reflection]:
    The official solution employs a set-based dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of minimizing the weight of the last remaining rock. The key insights from this solution are as follows:

    1. **Set for Achievable Sums**: Instead of using a boolean array to track achievable sums, the official solution uses a set `dp` to store all possible sums that can be formed with the given rock weights. This allows for more flexibility and avoids the need for a fixed size array.

    2. **Iterative Sum Calculation**: For each rock weight, the solution updates the set `dp` by adding the current stone's weight to each of the sums already in the set. This effectively generates all possible sums that can be formed with the rocks processed so far.

    3. **Final Calculation**: After processing all rocks, the solution calculates the minimum possible weight of the last stone by evaluating the absolute difference between the total weight and twice each sum in the set. This is based on the idea that the remaining weight can be derived from the difference between the total weight and the sum of one of the partitions.

    4. **Efficiency**: The use of a set allows for dynamic growth of achievable sums without the constraints of a fixed array size, making the solution both space-efficient and straightforward.

    In contrast, my initial approach used a boolean array which, while effective, could be less efficient in terms of space and did not leverage the flexibility of a set to dynamically track achievable sums. The official solution's method of directly calculating the minimum weight from the set of sums is also more elegant and concise. Overall, the official solution provides a more optimal and clear approach to the problem.

- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given an array A of strings, find anyÂ smallest string that contains each string in A as aÂ substring.
We may assume that no string in A is substring of another string in A.
Â 

Example 1:
Input: ["alex","loves","leetcode"]
Output: "alexlovesleetcode"
Explanation: All permutations of "alex","loves","leetcode" would also be accepted.


Example 2:
Input: ["catg","ctaagt","gcta","ttca","atgcatc"]
Output: "gctaagttcatgcatc"
Â 


Note:

1 <= A.length <= 12
1 <= A[i].length <= 20

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

INFO - [Task id] 374 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to find the shortest string that can contain all the given strings as substrings. The strings in the input list are guaranteed not to be substrings of one another.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach to generate all possible permutations of the input strings. For each permutation, we will merge the strings together while ensuring that we only add the necessary characters to maintain the substring property. We will keep track of the shortest merged string found during this process.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function shortestSuperstring(A):
       initialize shortest_string as an empty string
       for each permutation of A:
           merged_string = merge_strings(permutation)
           if shortest_string is empty or length of merged_string < length of shortest_string:
               shortest_string = merged_string
       return shortest_string

       start with the first string as merged
       for each string in strings starting from the second:
           overlap = find_max_overlap(merged, string)
           add the non-overlapping part of string to merged

INFO - [Task id] 374 [generation text] ### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: The goal is to find the shortest superstring that contains all the input strings as substrings. The output can be any valid shortest superstring, not necessarily in the order of the input strings.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: The previous implementation generates all permutations of the input strings and merges them based on the maximum overlap. However, it seems that the merging logic may not be correctly handling overlaps, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases.

3. **Overlap Calculation**: The overlap calculation in the `merge_strings` function only checks for overlaps from the end of the first string to the beginning of the second string. It does not account for overlaps in the reverse direction or for cases where the second string might overlap with the first string in a different way.

4. **Permutations and Merging**: While generating permutations is a valid approach, the merging logic needs to be robust enough to ensure that all possible overlaps are considered. The current implementation may not be merging strings optimally, leading to longer superstrings than necessary.

### Step-by-step Identification of Mistakes

1. **Merging Logic**: The merging logic needs to be improved to ensure that it checks for overlaps in both directions (i.e., from the end of one string to the start of another and vice versa).

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The implementation should also consider edge cases where strings may have partial overlaps that are not being captured correctly.

3. **Output Requirements**: The output should be any valid shortest superstring, but the current implementation may not be generating all possible valid combinations due to the way overlaps are calculated.

### Conclusion

To fix the code, I will:
- Revise the overlap calculation to ensure it checks for overlaps in both directions.
- Ensure that the merging process is robust and captures all possible overlaps.
- Maintain the overall structure of generating permutations but improve the merging logic to ensure correctness.

    While this is also $O(length(S))$, it requires no extra space and no recursive calls, consequently running faster in practice.

    ### Total length of all different substrings

    Given a string $S$.
    We want to compute the total length of all its various substrings.

    The solution is similar to the previous one, only now it is necessary to consider two quantities for the dynamic programming part:
    the number of different substrings $d[v]$ and their total length $ans[v]$.

    We already described how to compute $d[v]$ in the previous task.
    The value $ans[v]$ can be computed using the recursion:

    $$ans[v] = \sum_{w : (v, w, c) \in DAWG} d[w] + ans[w]$$

    We take the answer of each adjacent vertex $w$, and add to it $d[w]$ (since every substrings is one character longer when starting from the state $v$).

    Again this task can be computed in $O(length(S))$ time.

    Alternatively, we can, again, take advantage of the fact that each state $v$ matches to substrings of length $[minlen(v),len(v)]$.
    Since $minlen(v) = 1 + len(link(v))$ and the arithmetic series formula $S_n = n \cdot \frac{a_1+a_n}{2}$ (where $S_n$ denotes the sum of $n$ terms, $a_1$ representing the first term, and $a_n$ representing the last), we can compute the length of substrings at a state in constant time.  We then sum up these totals for each state $v \neq t_0$ in the automaton. This is shown by the code below:

    ```cpp
    long long get_tot_len_diff_substings() {
        long long tot = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < sz; i++) {
            long long shortest = st[st[i].link].len + 1;
            long long longest = st[i].len;
        
            long long num_strings = longest - shortest + 1;
            long long cur = num_strings * (longest + shortest) / 2;
            tot += cur;
        }
        return tot;
    }

    ### Shortest non-appearing string

    Given a string $S$ and a certain alphabet.
    We have to find a string of smallest length, that doesn't appear in $S$.

    We will apply dynamic programming on the suffix automaton built for the string $S$.

    Let $d[v]$ be the answer for the node $v$, i.e. we already processed part of the substring, are currently in the state $v$, and want to find the smallest number of characters that have to be added to find a non-existent transition.
    Computing $d[v]$ is very simple.
    If there is not transition using at least one character of the alphabet, then $d[v] = 1$.
    Otherwise one character is not enough, and so we need to take the minimum of all answers of all transitions:

    $$d[v] = 1 + \min_{w:(v,w,c) \in SA} d[w].$$

    The answer to the problem will be $d[t_0]$, and the actual string can be restored using the computed array $d[]$.

    ### Longest common substring of two strings

    Given two strings $S$ and $T$.
    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in $S$ and also in $T$.

    We construct a suffix automaton for the string $S$.

    We will now take the string $T$, and for each prefix look for the longest suffix of this prefix in $S$.
    In other words, for each position in the string $T$, we want to find the longest common substring of $S$ and $T$ ending in that position.

    For this we will use two variables, the **current state** $v$, and the **current length** $l$.
    These two variables will describe the current matching part: its length and the state that corresponds to it.

    Initially $v = t_0$ and $l = 0$, i.e. the match is empty.

    Now let us describe how we can add a character $T[i]$ and recalculate the answer for it.

      - If there is a transition from $v$ with the character $T[i]$, then we simply follow the transition and increase $l$ by one.
      - If there is no such transition, we have to shorten the current matching part, which means that we need to follow the suffix link: $v = link(v)$.
        At the same time, the current length has to be shortened.
        Obviously we need to assign $l = len(v)$, since after passing through the suffix link we end up in state whose corresponding longest string is a substring.
      - If there is still no transition using the required character, we repeat and again go through the suffix link and decrease $l$, until we find a transition or we reach the fictional state $-1$ (which means that the symbol $T[i]$ doesn't appear at all in $S$, so we assign $v = l = 0$).

    The answer to the task will be the maximum of all the values $l$.

    The complexity of this part is $O(length(T))$, since in one move we can either increase $l$ by one, or make several passes through the suffix links, each one ends up reducing the value $l$.

    Implementation:

    ```cpp
    string lcs (string S, string T) {
        sa_init();
        for (int i = 0; i < S.size(); i++)
            sa_extend(S[i]);
 
        int v = 0, l = 0, best = 0, bestpos = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < T.size(); i++) {
            while (v && !st[v].next.count(T[i])) {
                v = st[v].link ;
                l = st[v].len;
            }
            if (st[v].next.count(T[i])) {
                v = st [v].next[T[i]];
                l++;
            }
            if (l > best) {
                best = l;
                bestpos = i;
            }
        }
        return T.substr(bestpos - best + 1, best);
    } 
    ```

    ### Largest common substring of multiple strings

    There are $k$ strings $S_i$ given.
    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in each string $S_i$.

    We join all strings into one large string $T$, separating the strings by a special characters $D_i$ (one for each string):

    $$T = S_1 + D_1 + S_2 + D_2 + \dots + S_k + D_k.$$

    Then we construct the suffix automaton for the string $T$.

    Now we need to find a string in the machine, which is contained in all the strings $S_i$, and this can be done by using the special added characters.
    Note that if a substring is included in some string $S_j$, then in the suffix automaton exists a path starting from this substring containing the character $D_j$ and not containing the other characters $D_1, \dots, D_{j-1}, D_{j+1}, \dots, D_k$.

    Thus we need to calculate the attainability, which tells us for each state of the machine and each symbol $D_i$ if there exists such a path.
    This can easily be computed by DFS or BFS and dynamic programming.
    After that, the answer to the problem will be the string $longest(v)$ for the state $v$, from which the paths were exists for all special characters.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [generation text] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis and the provided memories, I will revise the solution to ensure that the merging logic correctly handles overlaps in both directions. This will help in generating the shortest superstring that contains all the input strings as substrings.

Hereâs the updated code:

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestSuperstring(self, A: list[str]) -> str:
        from itertools import permutations
        
        # Function to merge two strings with maximum overlap
        def merge_strings(s1, s2):
            max_overlap = 0
            # Find maximum overlap length from s1 to s2
            for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):
                if s1[i-1:] == s2[:len(s1) - i + 1]:
                    max_overlap = len(s1) - i + 1
            # Find maximum overlap length from s2 to s1
            for i in range(1, len(s2) + 1):
                if s2[i-1:] == s1[:len(s2) - i + 1]:
                    max_overlap = max(max_overlap, len(s2) - i + 1)
            # Merge the strings based on the maximum overlap found
            return s1 + s2[max_overlap:]

        shortest_string = ""
        
        # Generate all permutations of the input list

        return shortest_string
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Overlap Calculation**: The `merge_strings` function now checks for overlaps in both directions (from `s1` to `s2` and from `s2` to `s1`), ensuring that we find the maximum possible overlap when merging two strings.
2. **Robust Merging**: The merging process is designed to concatenate strings while minimizing the length of the resulting superstring.

This revised code should now correctly generate the shortest superstring that contains all input strings as substrings.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [prompt] ### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: The goal is to find the shortest superstring that contains all the input strings as substrings. The output can be any valid shortest superstring, not necessarily in the order of the input strings.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: The previous implementation generates all permutations of the input strings and merges them based on the maximum overlap. However, it seems that the merging logic may not be correctly handling overlaps, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases.

3. **Overlap Calculation**: The overlap calculation in the `merge_strings` function only checks for overlaps from the end of the first string to the beginning of the second string. It does not account for overlaps in the reverse direction or for cases where the second string might overlap with the first string in a different way.

4. **Permutations and Merging**: While generating permutations is a valid approach, the merging logic needs to be robust enough to ensure that all possible overlaps are considered. The current implementation may not be merging strings optimally, leading to longer superstrings than necessary.

### Step-by-step Identification of Mistakes

1. **Merging Logic**: The merging logic needs to be improved to ensure that it checks for overlaps in both directions (i.e., from the end of one string to the start of another and vice versa).

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The implementation should also consider edge cases where strings may have partial overlaps that are not being captured correctly.

3. **Output Requirements**: The output should be any valid shortest superstring, but the current implementation may not be generating all possible valid combinations due to the way overlaps are calculated.

### Conclusion

To fix the code, I will:
- Revise the overlap calculation to ensure it checks for overlaps in both directions.
- Ensure that the merging process is robust and captures all possible overlaps.
- Maintain the overall structure of generating permutations but improve the merging logic to ensure correctness.

Now, I will implement the revised solution.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [generation text] ### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: The task is to find the shortest superstring that contains all the input strings as substrings. The output can be any valid shortest superstring, not necessarily in the order of the input strings.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: The previous implementation generates all permutations of the input strings and merges them based on the maximum overlap. However, it seems that the merging logic may not be correctly handling overlaps, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases.

3. **Overlap Calculation**: The overlap calculation in the `merge_strings` function only checks for overlaps from the end of the first string to the beginning of the second string. It does not account for overlaps in the reverse direction or for cases where the second string might overlap with the first string in a different way.

4. **Permutations and Merging**: While generating permutations is a valid approach, the merging logic needs to be robust enough to ensure that all possible overlaps are considered. The current implementation may not be merging strings optimally, leading to longer superstrings than necessary.

### Step-by-step Identification of Mistakes

1. **Merging Logic**: The merging logic needs to be improved to ensure that it checks for overlaps in both directions. The current implementation may not be merging strings optimally, leading to longer superstrings than necessary.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The implementation should also consider edge cases where strings may have partial overlaps that are not being captured correctly.

3. **Output Requirements**: The output should be any valid shortest superstring, but the current implementation may not be generating all possible valid combinations due to the way overlaps are calculated.

### Conclusion

To fix the code, I will:
- Revise the overlap calculation to ensure it checks for overlaps in both directions.
- Ensure that the merging process is robust and captures all possible overlaps.
- Maintain the overall structure of generating permutations but improve the merging logic to ensure correctness.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given an array A of strings, find anyÂ smallest string that contains each string in A as aÂ substring.
We may assume that no string in A is substring of another string in A.
Â 

Example 1:
Input: ["alex","loves","leetcode"]
Output: "alexlovesleetcode"
Explanation: All permutations of "alex","loves","leetcode" would also be accepted.


Example 2:
Input: ["catg","ctaagt","gcta","ttca","atgcatc"]
Output: "gctaagttcatgcatc"
Â 


Note:

1 <= A.length <= 12
1 <= A[i].length <= 20

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def shortestSuperstring(self, A: List[str]) -> str:
        
```

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to find the shortest string that can contain all the given strings as substrings. The strings in the input list are guaranteed not to be substrings of one another.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach to generate all possible permutations of the input strings. For each permutation, we will merge the strings together while ensuring that we only add the necessary characters to maintain the substring property. We will keep track of the shortest merged string found during this process.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function shortestSuperstring(A):
       initialize shortest_string as an empty string
       for each permutation of A:
           merged_string = merge_strings(permutation)
           if shortest_string is empty or length of merged_string < length of shortest_string:
               shortest_string = merged_string
       return shortest_string

   function merge_strings(strings):
       start with the first string as merged
       for each string in strings starting from the second:
           overlap = find_max_overlap(merged, string)
           add the non-overlapping part of string to merged
       return merged

INFO - [Task id] 374 [prompt] ### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: The task is to find the shortest superstring that contains all the input strings as substrings. The output can be any valid shortest superstring, not necessarily in the order of the input strings.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: The previous implementation generates all permutations of the input strings and merges them based on the maximum overlap. However, it seems that the merging logic may not be correctly handling overlaps, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases.

3. **Overlap Calculation**: The overlap calculation in the `merge_strings` function only checks for overlaps from the end of the first string to the beginning of the second string. It does not account for overlaps in the reverse direction or for cases where the second string might overlap with the first string in a different way.

4. **Permutations and Merging**: While generating permutations is a valid approach, the merging logic needs to be robust enough to ensure that all possible overlaps are considered. The current implementation may not be merging strings optimally, leading to longer superstrings than necessary.

### Step-by-step Identification of Mistakes

1. **Merging Logic**: The merging logic needs to be improved to ensure that it checks for overlaps in both directions. The current implementation may not be merging strings optimally, leading to longer superstrings than necessary.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The implementation should also consider edge cases where strings may have partial overlaps that are not being captured correctly.

3. **Output Requirements**: The output should be any valid shortest superstring, but the current implementation may not be generating all possible valid combinations due to the way overlaps are calculated.

### Conclusion

To fix the code, I will:
- Revise the overlap calculation to ensure it checks for overlaps in both directions.
- Ensure that the merging process is robust and captures all possible overlaps.
- Maintain the overall structure of generating permutations but improve the merging logic to ensure correctness.

Now, I will implement the revised solution.

    While this is also $O(length(S))$, it requires no extra space and no recursive calls, consequently running faster in practice.

    ### Total length of all different substrings

    Given a string $S$.
    We want to compute the total length of all its various substrings.

    The solution is similar to the previous one, only now it is necessary to consider two quantities for the dynamic programming part:
    the number of different substrings $d[v]$ and their total length $ans[v]$.

    We already described how to compute $d[v]$ in the previous task.
    The value $ans[v]$ can be computed using the recursion:

    $$ans[v] = \sum_{w : (v, w, c) \in DAWG} d[w] + ans[w]$$

    We take the answer of each adjacent vertex $w$, and add to it $d[w]$ (since every substrings is one character longer when starting from the state $v$).

    Again this task can be computed in $O(length(S))$ time.

    Alternatively, we can, again, take advantage of the fact that each state $v$ matches to substrings of length $[minlen(v),len(v)]$.
    Since $minlen(v) = 1 + len(link(v))$ and the arithmetic series formula $S_n = n \cdot \frac{a_1+a_n}{2}$ (where $S_n$ denotes the sum of $n$ terms, $a_1$ representing the first term, and $a_n$ representing the last), we can compute the length of substrings at a state in constant time.  We then sum up these totals for each state $v \neq t_0$ in the automaton. This is shown by the code below:

    ```cpp
    long long get_tot_len_diff_substings() {
        long long tot = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < sz; i++) {
            long long shortest = st[st[i].link].len + 1;
            long long longest = st[i].len;
        
            long long num_strings = longest - shortest + 1;
            long long cur = num_strings * (longest + shortest) / 2;
            tot += cur;
        }
        return tot;
    }

    ### Shortest non-appearing string

    Given a string $S$ and a certain alphabet.
    We have to find a string of smallest length, that doesn't appear in $S$.

    We will apply dynamic programming on the suffix automaton built for the string $S$.

    Let $d[v]$ be the answer for the node $v$, i.e. we already processed part of the substring, are currently in the state $v$, and want to find the smallest number of characters that have to be added to find a non-existent transition.
    Computing $d[v]$ is very simple.
    If there is not transition using at least one character of the alphabet, then $d[v] = 1$.
    Otherwise one character is not enough, and so we need to take the minimum of all answers of all transitions:

    $$d[v] = 1 + \min_{w:(v,w,c) \in SA} d[w].$$

    The answer to the problem will be $d[t_0]$, and the actual string can be restored using the computed array $d[]$.

    ### Longest common substring of two strings

    Given two strings $S$ and $T$.
    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in $S$ and also in $T$.

    We construct a suffix automaton for the string $S$.

    We will now take the string $T$, and for each prefix look for the longest suffix of this prefix in $S$.
    In other words, for each position in the string $T$, we want to find the longest common substring of $S$ and $T$ ending in that position.

    For this we will use two variables, the **current state** $v$, and the **current length** $l$.
    These two variables will describe the current matching part: its length and the state that corresponds to it.

    Initially $v = t_0$ and $l = 0$, i.e. the match is empty.

    Now let us describe how we can add a character $T[i]$ and recalculate the answer for it.

      - If there is a transition from $v$ with the character $T[i]$, then we simply follow the transition and increase $l$ by one.
      - If there is no such transition, we have to shorten the current matching part, which means that we need to follow the suffix link: $v = link(v)$.
        At the same time, the current length has to be shortened.
        Obviously we need to assign $l = len(v)$, since after passing through the suffix link we end up in state whose corresponding longest string is a substring.
      - If there is still no transition using the required character, we repeat and again go through the suffix link and decrease $l$, until we find a transition or we reach the fictional state $-1$ (which means that the symbol $T[i]$ doesn't appear at all in $S$, so we assign $v = l = 0$).

    The answer to the task will be the maximum of all the values $l$.

    The complexity of this part is $O(length(T))$, since in one move we can either increase $l$ by one, or make several passes through the suffix links, each one ends up reducing the value $l$.

    Implementation:

    ```cpp
    string lcs (string S, string T) {
        sa_init();
        for (int i = 0; i < S.size(); i++)
            sa_extend(S[i]);
 
        int v = 0, l = 0, best = 0, bestpos = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < T.size(); i++) {
            while (v && !st[v].next.count(T[i])) {
                v = st[v].link ;
                l = st[v].len;
            }
            if (st[v].next.count(T[i])) {
                v = st [v].next[T[i]];
                l++;
            }
            if (l > best) {
                best = l;
                bestpos = i;
            }
        }
        return T.substr(bestpos - best + 1, best);
    } 
    ```

    ### Largest common substring of multiple strings

    There are $k$ strings $S_i$ given.
    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in each string $S_i$.

    We join all strings into one large string $T$, separating the strings by a special characters $D_i$ (one for each string):

    $$T = S_1 + D_1 + S_2 + D_2 + \dots + S_k + D_k.$$

    Then we construct the suffix automaton for the string $T$.

    Now we need to find a string in the machine, which is contained in all the strings $S_i$, and this can be done by using the special added characters.
    Note that if a substring is included in some string $S_j$, then in the suffix automaton exists a path starting from this substring containing the character $D_j$ and not containing the other characters $D_1, \dots, D_{j-1}, D_{j+1}, \dots, D_k$.

    Thus we need to calculate the attainability, which tells us for each state of the machine and each symbol $D_i$ if there exists such a path.
    This can easily be computed by DFS or BFS and dynamic programming.
    After that, the answer to the problem will be the string $longest(v)$ for the state $v$, from which the paths were exists for all special characters.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [generation text] To address the issue with the previous implementation, I will revise the merging logic to ensure that it correctly handles overlaps in both directions and optimally merges the strings. The goal is to ensure that the shortest superstring is generated correctly.

### Key Changes to Implement:
1. **Improved Overlap Calculation**: The merging function will be updated to find the maximum overlap in both directions (from `s1` to `s2` and from `s2` to `s1`).
2. **Correct Merging Logic**: The merging logic will ensure that the strings are combined in a way that minimizes the length of the resulting superstring.

Hereâs the updated code:

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestSuperstring(self, A: list[str]) -> str:
        from itertools import permutations
        
        # Function to merge two strings with maximum overlap
        def merge_strings(s1, s2):
            max_overlap = 0

                    max_overlap = max(max_overlap, len(s2) - i + 1)
            # Merge the strings based on the maximum overlap found
            return s1 + s2[max_overlap:]

                shortest_string = merged_string
        
        return shortest_string
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Permutations**: The code generates all permutations of the input list `A` to explore all possible orders of merging the strings.
- **Merging Logic**: The `merge_strings` function calculates the maximum overlap between two strings in both directions and merges them accordingly.
- **Finding the Shortest Superstring**: The code keeps track of the shortest superstring found during the merging of all permutations.

This revised implementation should now correctly generate the shortest superstring that contains all input strings as substrings.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [prompt] ### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: The goal is to find the shortest superstring that contains all the input strings as substrings. The output can be any valid shortest superstring, not necessarily in the order of the input strings.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: The previous implementation generates all permutations of the input strings and merges them based on the maximum overlap. However, it seems that the merging logic may not be correctly handling overlaps, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases.

3. **Overlap Calculation**: The overlap calculation in the `merge_strings` function only checks for overlaps from the end of the first string to the beginning of the second string. It does not account for overlaps in the reverse direction or for cases where the second string might overlap with the first string in a different way.

4. **Permutations and Merging**: While generating permutations is a valid approach, the merging logic needs to be robust enough to ensure that all possible overlaps are considered. The current implementation may not be merging strings optimally, leading to longer superstrings than necessary.

### Step-by-step Identification of Mistakes

1. **Merging Logic**: The merging logic needs to be improved to ensure that it checks for overlaps in both directions (i.e., from the end of one string to the start of another and vice versa).

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The implementation should also consider edge cases where strings may have partial overlaps that are not being captured correctly.

3. **Output Requirements**: The output should be any valid shortest superstring, but the current implementation may not be generating all possible valid combinations due to the way overlaps are calculated.

### Conclusion

To fix the code, I will:
- Revise the overlap calculation to ensure it checks for overlaps in both directions.
- Ensure that the merging process is robust and captures all possible overlaps.
- Maintain the overall structure of generating permutations but improve the merging logic to ensure correctness.

Now, I will implement the revised solution.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [prompt] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis and the provided memories, I will revise the solution to ensure that the merging logic correctly handles overlaps in both directions. This will help in generating the shortest superstring that contains all the input strings as substrings.

Hereâs the updated code:

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestSuperstring(self, A: list[str]) -> str:
        from itertools import permutations
        
        # Function to merge two strings with maximum overlap
        def merge_strings(s1, s2):
            max_overlap = 0

                if s1[i-1:] == s2[:len(s1) - i + 1]:
                    max_overlap = len(s1) - i + 1
            # Find maximum overlap length from s2 to s1
            for i in range(1, len(s2) + 1):
                if s2[i-1:] == s1[:len(s2) - i + 1]:
                    max_overlap = max(max_overlap, len(s2) - i + 1)
            # Merge the strings based on the maximum overlap found
            return s1 + s2[max_overlap:]

        shortest_string = ""
        
        # Generate all permutations of the input list
        for perm in permutations(A):
            merged_string = perm[0]
            # Merge all strings in the current permutation
            for i in range(1, len(perm)):
                merged_string = merge_strings(merged_string, perm[i])
            # Update the shortest string found

                shortest_string = merged_string
        
        return shortest_string
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Overlap Calculation**: The `merge_strings` function now checks for overlaps in both directions (from `s1` to `s2` and from `s2` to `s1`), ensuring that we find the maximum possible overlap when merging two strings.
2. **Robust Merging**: The merging process is designed to concatenate strings while minimizing the length of the resulting superstring.

This revised code should now correctly generate the shortest superstring that contains all input strings as substrings.

- **Finding the Shortest Superstring**: The code keeps track of the shortest superstring found during the merging of all permutations.

1. Restate the problem in plain English

4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to find the shortest string that can contain all the given strings as substrings. The strings in the input list are guaranteed not to be substrings of one another.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach to generate all possible permutations of the input strings. For each permutation, we will merge the strings together while ensuring that we only add the necessary characters to maintain the substring property. We will keep track of the shortest merged string found during this process.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function shortestSuperstring(A):
       initialize shortest_string as an empty string
       for each permutation of A:
           merged_string = merge_strings(permutation)
           if shortest_string is empty or length of merged_string < length of shortest_string:
               shortest_string = merged_string
       return shortest_string

   function merge_strings(strings):
       start with the first string as merged
       for each string in strings starting from the second:
           overlap = find_max_overlap(merged, string)
           add the non-overlapping part of string to merged
       return merged

   function find_max_overlap(s1, s2):
       max_overlap = 0
       for i from 1 to length of s1:
           if s1[i:] is equal to s2[:length of s1 - i]:
               max_overlap = length of s1 - i
       return max_overlap
   ```

INFO - [Task id] 374 [prompt] ### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: The goal is to find the shortest superstring that contains all the input strings as substrings. The output can be any valid shortest superstring, not necessarily in the order of the input strings.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: The previous implementation generates all permutations of the input strings and merges them based on the maximum overlap. However, it seems that the merging logic may not be correctly handling overlaps, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases.

3. **Overlap Calculation**: The overlap calculation in the `merge_strings` function only checks for overlaps from the end of the first string to the beginning of the second string. It does not account for overlaps in the reverse direction or for cases where the second string might overlap with the first string in a different way.

4. **Permutations and Merging**: While generating permutations is a valid approach, the merging logic needs to be robust enough to ensure that all possible overlaps are considered. The current implementation may not be merging strings optimally, leading to longer superstrings than necessary.

### Step-by-step Identification of Mistakes

1. **Merging Logic**: The merging logic needs to be improved to ensure that it checks for overlaps in both directions (i.e., from the end of one string to the start of another and vice versa).

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The implementation should also consider edge cases where strings may have partial overlaps that are not being captured correctly.

3. **Output Requirements**: The output should be any valid shortest superstring, but the current implementation may not be generating all possible valid combinations due to the way overlaps are calculated.

### Conclusion

To fix the code, I will:
- Revise the overlap calculation to ensure it checks for overlaps in both directions.
- Ensure that the merging process is robust and captures all possible overlaps.
- Maintain the overall structure of generating permutations but improve the merging logic to ensure correctness.

Now, I will implement the revised solution.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [prompt] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis and the provided memories, I will revise the solution to ensure that the merging logic correctly handles overlaps in both directions. This will help in generating the shortest superstring that contains all the input strings as substrings.

Hereâs the updated code:

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestSuperstring(self, A: list[str]) -> str:
        from itertools import permutations
        
        # Function to merge two strings with maximum overlap
        def merge_strings(s1, s2):
            max_overlap = 0

                if s1[i-1:] == s2[:len(s1) - i + 1]:
                    max_overlap = len(s1) - i + 1
            # Find maximum overlap length from s2 to s1
            for i in range(1, len(s2) + 1):
                if s2[i-1:] == s1[:len(s2) - i + 1]:
                    max_overlap = max(max_overlap, len(s2) - i + 1)
            # Merge the strings based on the maximum overlap found
            return s1 + s2[max_overlap:]

        shortest_string = ""
        
        # Generate all permutations of the input list
        for perm in permutations(A):
            merged_string = perm[0]
            # Merge all strings in the current permutation
            for i in range(1, len(perm)):
                merged_string = merge_strings(merged_string, perm[i])
            # Update the shortest string found
            if shortest_string == "" or len(merged_string) < len(shortest_string):
                shortest_string = merged_string
        
        return shortest_string
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Overlap Calculation**: The `merge_strings` function now checks for overlaps in both directions (from `s1` to `s2` and from `s2` to `s1`), ensuring that we find the maximum possible overlap when merging two strings.
2. **Robust Merging**: The merging process is designed to concatenate strings while minimizing the length of the resulting superstring.

This revised code should now correctly generate the shortest superstring that contains all input strings as substrings.

    While this is also $O(length(S))$, it requires no extra space and no recursive calls, consequently running faster in practice.

    ### Total length of all different substrings

    Given a string $S$.
    We want to compute the total length of all its various substrings.

    The solution is similar to the previous one, only now it is necessary to consider two quantities for the dynamic programming part:
    the number of different substrings $d[v]$ and their total length $ans[v]$.

    We already described how to compute $d[v]$ in the previous task.
    The value $ans[v]$ can be computed using the recursion:

    $$ans[v] = \sum_{w : (v, w, c) \in DAWG} d[w] + ans[w]$$

    We take the answer of each adjacent vertex $w$, and add to it $d[w]$ (since every substrings is one character longer when starting from the state $v$).

    Again this task can be computed in $O(length(S))$ time.

    Alternatively, we can, again, take advantage of the fact that each state $v$ matches to substrings of length $[minlen(v),len(v)]$.
    Since $minlen(v) = 1 + len(link(v))$ and the arithmetic series formula $S_n = n \cdot \frac{a_1+a_n}{2}$ (where $S_n$ denotes the sum of $n$ terms, $a_1$ representing the first term, and $a_n$ representing the last), we can compute the length of substrings at a state in constant time.  We then sum up these totals for each state $v \neq t_0$ in the automaton. This is shown by the code below:

    ```cpp
    long long get_tot_len_diff_substings() {
        long long tot = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < sz; i++) {
            long long shortest = st[st[i].link].len + 1;
            long long longest = st[i].len;
        
            long long num_strings = longest - shortest + 1;
            long long cur = num_strings * (longest + shortest) / 2;
            tot += cur;
        }
        return tot;
    }

    ```

    ### Shortest non-appearing string

    Given a string $S$ and a certain alphabet.
    We have to find a string of smallest length, that doesn't appear in $S$.

    We will apply dynamic programming on the suffix automaton built for the string $S$.

    Let $d[v]$ be the answer for the node $v$, i.e. we already processed part of the substring, are currently in the state $v$, and want to find the smallest number of characters that have to be added to find a non-existent transition.
    Computing $d[v]$ is very simple.
    If there is not transition using at least one character of the alphabet, then $d[v] = 1$.
    Otherwise one character is not enough, and so we need to take the minimum of all answers of all transitions:

    $$d[v] = 1 + \min_{w:(v,w,c) \in SA} d[w].$$

    The answer to the problem will be $d[t_0]$, and the actual string can be restored using the computed array $d[]$.

    ### Longest common substring of two strings

    Given two strings $S$ and $T$.
    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in $S$ and also in $T$.

    We construct a suffix automaton for the string $S$.

    We will now take the string $T$, and for each prefix look for the longest suffix of this prefix in $S$.
    In other words, for each position in the string $T$, we want to find the longest common substring of $S$ and $T$ ending in that position.

    For this we will use two variables, the **current state** $v$, and the **current length** $l$.
    These two variables will describe the current matching part: its length and the state that corresponds to it.

    Initially $v = t_0$ and $l = 0$, i.e. the match is empty.

    Now let us describe how we can add a character $T[i]$ and recalculate the answer for it.

      - If there is a transition from $v$ with the character $T[i]$, then we simply follow the transition and increase $l$ by one.
      - If there is no such transition, we have to shorten the current matching part, which means that we need to follow the suffix link: $v = link(v)$.
        At the same time, the current length has to be shortened.
        Obviously we need to assign $l = len(v)$, since after passing through the suffix link we end up in state whose corresponding longest string is a substring.
      - If there is still no transition using the required character, we repeat and again go through the suffix link and decrease $l$, until we find a transition or we reach the fictional state $-1$ (which means that the symbol $T[i]$ doesn't appear at all in $S$, so we assign $v = l = 0$).

    The answer to the task will be the maximum of all the values $l$.

    The complexity of this part is $O(length(T))$, since in one move we can either increase $l$ by one, or make several passes through the suffix links, each one ends up reducing the value $l$.

    Implementation:

    ```cpp
    string lcs (string S, string T) {
        sa_init();
        for (int i = 0; i < S.size(); i++)
            sa_extend(S[i]);
 
        int v = 0, l = 0, best = 0, bestpos = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < T.size(); i++) {
            while (v && !st[v].next.count(T[i])) {
                v = st[v].link ;
                l = st[v].len;
            }
            if (st[v].next.count(T[i])) {
                v = st [v].next[T[i]];
                l++;
            }
            if (l > best) {
                best = l;
                bestpos = i;
            }
        }
        return T.substr(bestpos - best + 1, best);
    } 
    ```

    ### Largest common substring of multiple strings

    There are $k$ strings $S_i$ given.
    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in each string $S_i$.

    We join all strings into one large string $T$, separating the strings by a special characters $D_i$ (one for each string):

    $$T = S_1 + D_1 + S_2 + D_2 + \dots + S_k + D_k.$$

    Then we construct the suffix automaton for the string $T$.

    Now we need to find a string in the machine, which is contained in all the strings $S_i$, and this can be done by using the special added characters.
    Note that if a substring is included in some string $S_j$, then in the suffix automaton exists a path starting from this substring containing the character $D_j$ and not containing the other characters $D_1, \dots, D_{j-1}, D_{j+1}, \dots, D_k$.

    Thus we need to calculate the attainability, which tells us for each state of the machine and each symbol $D_i$ if there exists such a path.
    This can easily be computed by DFS or BFS and dynamic programming.
    After that, the answer to the problem will be the string $longest(v)$ for the state $v$, from which the paths were exists for all special characters.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [generation text] To address the issue with the previous implementation, I will revise the merging logic to ensure that it correctly handles overlaps in both directions and optimally merges the strings. The goal is to ensure that the shortest superstring is generated correctly.

### Key Changes to Implement:
1. **Improved Overlap Calculation**: The merging function will be updated to find the maximum overlap in both directions (from `s1` to `s2` and from `s2` to `s1`).
2. **Correct Merging Logic**: The merging logic will ensure that the strings are combined in a way that minimizes the length of the resulting superstring.

Hereâs the updated code:

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestSuperstring(self, A: list[str]) -> str:
        from itertools import permutations
        
        # Function to merge two strings with maximum overlap
        def merge_strings(s1, s2):
            max_overlap = 0
            # Find maximum overlap length from s1 to s2
            for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):
                if s1[i-1:] == s2[:len(s1) - i + 1]:
                    max_overlap = len(s1) - i + 1
            # Find maximum overlap length from s2 to s1
            for i in range(1, len(s2) + 1):
                if s2[i-1:] == s1[:len(s2) - i + 1]:
                    max_overlap = max(max_overlap, len(s2) - i + 1)
            # Merge the strings based on the maximum overlap found
            return s1 + s2[max_overlap:]

        shortest_string = ""
        
        # Generate all permutations of the input list
        for perm in permutations(A):
            merged_string = perm[0]
            # Merge all strings in the current permutation
            for i in range(1, len(perm)):
                merged_string = merge_strings(merged_string, perm[i])
            # Update the shortest string found
            if shortest_string == "" or len(merged_string) < len(shortest_string):
                shortest_string = merged_string
        
        return shortest_string
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Permutations**: The code generates all permutations of the input list `A` to explore all possible orders of merging the strings.
- **Merging Logic**: The `merge_strings` function calculates the maximum overlap between two strings in both directions and merges them accordingly.
- **Finding the Shortest Superstring**: The code keeps track of the shortest superstring found during the merging of all permutations.

This revised implementation should now correctly generate the shortest superstring that contains all input strings as substrings.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [prompt] ### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: The goal is to find the shortest superstring that contains all the input strings as substrings. The output can be any valid shortest superstring, not necessarily in the order of the input strings.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: The previous implementation generates all permutations of the input strings and merges them based on the maximum overlap. However, it seems that the merging logic may not be correctly handling overlaps, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases.

3. **Overlap Calculation**: The overlap calculation in the `merge_strings` function only checks for overlaps from the end of the first string to the beginning of the second string. It does not account for overlaps in the reverse direction or for cases where the second string might overlap with the first string in a different way.

4. **Permutations and Merging**: While generating permutations is a valid approach, the merging logic needs to be robust enough to ensure that all possible overlaps are considered. The current implementation may not be merging strings optimally, leading to longer superstrings than necessary.

### Step-by-step Identification of Mistakes

1. **Merging Logic**: The merging logic needs to be improved to ensure that it checks for overlaps in both directions (i.e., from the end of one string to the start of another and vice versa).

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The implementation should also consider edge cases where strings may have partial overlaps that are not being captured correctly.

3. **Output Requirements**: The output should be any valid shortest superstring, but the current implementation may not be generating all possible valid combinations due to the way overlaps are calculated.

### Conclusion

To fix the code, I will:
- Revise the overlap calculation to ensure it checks for overlaps in both directions.
- Ensure that the merging process is robust and captures all possible overlaps.
- Maintain the overall structure of generating permutations but improve the merging logic to ensure correctness.

Now, I will implement the revised solution.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [prompt] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis and the provided memories, I will revise the solution to ensure that the merging logic correctly handles overlaps in both directions. This will help in generating the shortest superstring that contains all the input strings as substrings.

Hereâs the updated code:

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestSuperstring(self, A: list[str]) -> str:
        from itertools import permutations
        
        # Function to merge two strings with maximum overlap
        def merge_strings(s1, s2):
            max_overlap = 0
            # Find maximum overlap length from s1 to s2
            for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):
                if s1[i-1:] == s2[:len(s1) - i + 1]:
                    max_overlap = len(s1) - i + 1
            # Find maximum overlap length from s2 to s1
            for i in range(1, len(s2) + 1):
                if s2[i-1:] == s1[:len(s2) - i + 1]:
                    max_overlap = max(max_overlap, len(s2) - i + 1)
            # Merge the strings based on the maximum overlap found
            return s1 + s2[max_overlap:]

        shortest_string = ""
        
        # Generate all permutations of the input list
        for perm in permutations(A):
            merged_string = perm[0]
            # Merge all strings in the current permutation
            for i in range(1, len(perm)):
                merged_string = merge_strings(merged_string, perm[i])
            # Update the shortest string found

                shortest_string = merged_string
        
        return shortest_string
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Overlap Calculation**: The `merge_strings` function now checks for overlaps in both directions (from `s1` to `s2` and from `s2` to `s1`), ensuring that we find the maximum possible overlap when merging two strings.
2. **Robust Merging**: The merging process is designed to concatenate strings while minimizing the length of the resulting superstring.

This revised code should now correctly generate the shortest superstring that contains all input strings as substrings.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [prompt] ### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: The task is to find the shortest superstring that contains all the input strings as substrings. The output can be any valid shortest superstring, not necessarily in the order of the input strings.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: The previous implementation generates all permutations of the input strings and merges them based on the maximum overlap. However, it seems that the merging logic may not be correctly handling overlaps, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases.

3. **Overlap Calculation**: The overlap calculation in the `merge_strings` function only checks for overlaps from the end of the first string to the beginning of the second string. It does not account for overlaps in the reverse direction or for cases where the second string might overlap with the first string in a different way.

4. **Permutations and Merging**: While generating permutations is a valid approach, the merging logic needs to be robust enough to ensure that all possible overlaps are considered. The current implementation may not be merging strings optimally, leading to longer superstrings than necessary.

### Step-by-step Identification of Mistakes

1. **Merging Logic**: The merging logic needs to be improved to ensure that it checks for overlaps in both directions. The current implementation may not be merging strings optimally, leading to longer superstrings than necessary.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The implementation should also consider edge cases where strings may have partial overlaps that are not being captured correctly.

3. **Output Requirements**: The output should be any valid shortest superstring, but the current implementation may not be generating all possible valid combinations due to the way overlaps are calculated.

### Conclusion

To fix the code, I will:
- Revise the overlap calculation to ensure it checks for overlaps in both directions.
- Ensure that the merging process is robust and captures all possible overlaps.
- Maintain the overall structure of generating permutations but improve the merging logic to ensure correctness.

Now, I will implement the revised solution.

    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [generation text] The task was to find the shortest superstring that contains all given strings as substrings. The initial approach involved generating all permutations of the input strings and merging them based on maximum overlaps. However, the merging logic was flawed, as it did not correctly account for overlaps in both directions, leading to incorrect outputs.

Key concepts involved in this problem include:
- **Permutations**: Exploring all possible orders of the input strings to find the optimal merging.
- **String Overlap Calculation**: Merging strings based on the maximum overlap, which should consider overlaps from both strings in both directions.

Despite multiple attempts to refine the merging logic, the implementation consistently failed to produce the expected results. The merging function needed to be more robust in calculating overlaps, and the overall strategy of generating permutations was sound but required a more effective merging mechanism.

The final code snippet aimed to address these issues but still did not pass the tests. The merging function was supposed to find the maximum overlap between two strings, but it failed to produce the correct order of strings in the final output. 

Hereâs the last version of the merging function for reference:

```python
def merge_strings(s1, s2):
    max_overlap = 0
    # Find maximum overlap length from s1 to s2
    for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):
        if s1[i-1:] == s2[:len(s1) - i + 1]:
            max_overlap = len(s1) - i + 1
    # Find maximum overlap length from s2 to s1
    for i in range(1, len(s2) + 1):
        if s2[i-1:] == s1[:len(s2) - i + 1]:
            max_overlap = max(max_overlap, len(s2) - i + 1)
    # Merge the strings based on the maximum overlap found
    return s1 + s2[max_overlap:]
```

In summary, the main takeaway is the importance of correctly implementing the overlap logic in string merging problems, as well as the need to thoroughly test edge cases to ensure robustness.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [prompt] ### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: The goal is to find the shortest superstring that contains all the input strings as substrings. The output can be any valid shortest superstring, not necessarily in the order of the input strings.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: The previous implementation generates all permutations of the input strings and merges them based on the maximum overlap. However, it seems that the merging logic may not be correctly handling overlaps, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases.

3. **Overlap Calculation**: The overlap calculation in the `merge_strings` function only checks for overlaps from the end of the first string to the beginning of the second string. It does not account for overlaps in the reverse direction or for cases where the second string might overlap with the first string in a different way.

4. **Permutations and Merging**: While generating permutations is a valid approach, the merging logic needs to be robust enough to ensure that all possible overlaps are considered. The current implementation may not be merging strings optimally, leading to longer superstrings than necessary.

### Step-by-step Identification of Mistakes

1. **Merging Logic**: The merging logic needs to be improved to ensure that it checks for overlaps in both directions (i.e., from the end of one string to the start of another and vice versa).

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The implementation should also consider edge cases where strings may have partial overlaps that are not being captured correctly.

3. **Output Requirements**: The output should be any valid shortest superstring, but the current implementation may not be generating all possible valid combinations due to the way overlaps are calculated.

### Conclusion

To fix the code, I will:
- Revise the overlap calculation to ensure it checks for overlaps in both directions.
- Ensure that the merging process is robust and captures all possible overlaps.
- Maintain the overall structure of generating permutations but improve the merging logic to ensure correctness.

Now, I will implement the revised solution.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [prompt] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis and the provided memories, I will revise the solution to ensure that the merging logic correctly handles overlaps in both directions. This will help in generating the shortest superstring that contains all the input strings as substrings.

Hereâs the updated code:

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestSuperstring(self, A: list[str]) -> str:
        from itertools import permutations
        
        # Function to merge two strings with maximum overlap
        def merge_strings(s1, s2):
            max_overlap = 0
            # Find maximum overlap length from s1 to s2
            for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):
                if s1[i-1:] == s2[:len(s1) - i + 1]:
                    max_overlap = len(s1) - i + 1
            # Find maximum overlap length from s2 to s1
            for i in range(1, len(s2) + 1):
                if s2[i-1:] == s1[:len(s2) - i + 1]:
                    max_overlap = max(max_overlap, len(s2) - i + 1)
            # Merge the strings based on the maximum overlap found
            return s1 + s2[max_overlap:]

        shortest_string = ""
        
        # Generate all permutations of the input list
        for perm in permutations(A):
            merged_string = perm[0]
            # Merge all strings in the current permutation
            for i in range(1, len(perm)):
                merged_string = merge_strings(merged_string, perm[i])
            # Update the shortest string found
            if shortest_string == "" or len(merged_string) < len(shortest_string):
                shortest_string = merged_string
        
        return shortest_string
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Overlap Calculation**: The `merge_strings` function now checks for overlaps in both directions (from `s1` to `s2` and from `s2` to `s1`), ensuring that we find the maximum possible overlap when merging two strings.
2. **Robust Merging**: The merging process is designed to concatenate strings while minimizing the length of the resulting superstring.

This revised code should now correctly generate the shortest superstring that contains all input strings as substrings.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 374 [generation text] ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience

In my attempts to solve the problem of finding the shortest superstring that contains all given strings as substrings, I learned several key insights that highlight the differences between my approach and the official solution.

1. **Overlap Handling**: My initial solution focused on generating permutations and merging strings based on maximum overlaps. However, I failed to account for all possible overlaps effectively, particularly in both directions. The official solution uses a more systematic approach to merging strings by checking for overlaps in a more controlled manner, ensuring that the resulting string is minimized.

2. **Memoization**: The official solution employs memoization to cache results of previously computed states, which significantly optimizes the recursive function that builds the superstring. This technique reduces redundant calculations and improves efficiency, especially given the potential exponential number of combinations. My approach did not utilize memoization, leading to repeated calculations and inefficiencies.

3. **Filtering Redundant Strings**: The official solution begins by filtering out any strings that are substrings of others, which simplifies the problem space. This step is crucial as it reduces the number of strings to consider, making the subsequent merging and searching more efficient. My implementation did not include this optimization, which could lead to unnecessary complexity.

4. **Recursive Structure**: The official solution uses a recursive function to explore combinations of strings, which is more elegant and manageable than the permutation approach I initially took. This recursive structure, combined with memoization, allows for a clearer and more efficient exploration of possible superstrings.

### Key Code Snippets from the Official Solution
- **Merge Function**: Efficiently merges two strings based on the maximum overlap.
  ```python
  def merge(w1, w2):
      for k in range(len(w2), -1, -1):
          if w1.endswith(w2[:k]):
              return w1 + w2[k:]
  ```

- **Memoization Decorator**: Caches results of the recursive function to avoid redundant calculations.
  ```python
  def memo(f):
      dic = {}
      def f_alt(*args):
          if args not in dic:
              dic[args] = f(*args)
          return dic[args]
      return f_alt
  ```

- **Recursive Function to Find Shortest Superstring**: Explores combinations of strings while leveraging memoization.
  ```python
  @memo
  def find_short(tup, last):
      if len(tup) == 1:
          return A[tup[0]]
      mtup = tuple(t for t in tup if t != last)
      return min((merge(find_short(mtup, t), A[last]) for t in mtup), key=len)
  ```

Overall, the official solution's approach is more efficient and systematic, leveraging memoization and careful overlap handling to ensure optimal performance. This experience has highlighted the importance of considering optimizations and the structure of the solution when tackling complex problems.
