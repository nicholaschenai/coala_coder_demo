    "raw_msg": "To address the issue with the previous implementation, I will revise the merging logic to ensure that it correctly handles overlaps in both directions and optimally merges the strings. The goal is to ensure that the shortest superstring is generated correctly.\n\n### Key Changes to Implement:\n1. **Improved Overlap Calculation**: The merging function will be updated to find the maximum overlap in both directions (from `s1` to `s2` and from `s2` to `s1`).\n2. **Correct Merging Logic**: The merging logic will ensure that the strings are combined in a way that minimizes the length of the resulting superstring.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated code:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestSuperstring(self, A: list[str]) -> str:\n        from itertools import permutations\n        \n        # Function to merge two strings with maximum overlap\n        def merge_strings(s1, s2):\n            max_overlap = 0\n            # Find maximum overlap length from s1 to s2\n            for i in range(1, len(s1) + 1):\n                if s1[i-1:] == s2[:len(s1) - i + 1]:\n                    max_overlap = len(s1) - i + 1\n            # Find maximum overlap length from s2 to s1\n            for i in range(1, len(s2) + 1):\n                if s2[i-1:] == s1[:len(s2) - i + 1]:\n                    max_overlap = max(max_overlap, len(s2) - i + 1)\n            # Merge the strings based on the maximum overlap found\n            return s1 + s2[max_overlap:]\n\n        shortest_string = \"\"\n        \n        # Generate all permutations of the input list\n        for perm in permutations(A):\n            merged_string = perm[0]\n            # Merge all strings in the current permutation\n            for i in range(1, len(perm)):\n                merged_string = merge_strings(merged_string, perm[i])\n            # Update the shortest string found\n            if shortest_string == \"\" or len(merged_string) < len(shortest_string):\n                shortest_string = merged_string\n        \n        return shortest_string\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- **Permutations**: The code generates all permutations of the input list `A` to explore all possible orders of merging the strings.\n- **Merging Logic**: The `merge_strings` function calculates the maximum overlap between two strings in both directions and merges them accordingly.\n- **Finding the Shortest Superstring**: The code keeps track of the shortest superstring found during the merging of all permutations.\n\nThis revised implementation should now correctly generate the shortest superstring that contains all input strings as substrings.",
