    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to determine if we could replace question marks in a string with lowercase letters such that the substring \"abacaba\" appears exactly once. The main challenges included ensuring that the placement of \"abacaba\" did not lead to multiple occurrences and correctly handling the replacement of remaining question marks.\n\nKey strategies included:\n1. Iterating through possible positions in the string to place \"abacaba\" while checking if the characters matched or were question marks.\n2. After placing \"abacaba\", replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not create additional occurrences of \"abacaba\".\n\nHowever, the initial implementation failed to account for overlapping placements and did not correctly check for existing occurrences of \"abacaba\" after replacements. The solution needed to ensure that after attempting to place \"abacaba\", the final string contained it exactly once.\n\nThe final code snippet that was intended to solve the problem is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef can_form_abacaba(n, s):\n    target = \"abacaba\"\n    \n    # Try to place \"abacaba\" in every possible position\n    for i in range(n - 6):\n        # Check if we can match \"abacaba\" at position i\n        can_place = True\n        for j in range(7):\n            if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:\n                can_place = False\n                break\n        \n        if can_place:\n            # Create a new version of the string with \"abacaba\" placed\n            new_s = list(s)\n            for j in range(7):\n                new_s[i + j] = target[j]\n            new_s = ''.join(new_s)\n            \n            # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'\n            new_s = new_s.replace('?', 'z')\n            \n            # Check if \"abacaba\" appears exactly once\n            if new_s.count(target) == 1:\n                return \"Yes\\n\" + new_s\n    \n    return \"No\"\n\n# Main function to handle input and output\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    n = int(input())\n    s = input().strip()\n    result = can_form_abacaba(n, s)\n    print(result)\n```\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing string manipulations and ensuring that all edge cases are considered, particularly when dealing with substrings and replacements.",
    "reflection": "In reflecting on my attempts to solve the problem, I realized several key insights that differentiate my approach from the official solution.\n\n1. **Counting Occurrences**: The official solution effectively counts the occurrences of \"abacaba\" in the string using a dedicated function (`check`). This function iterates through the string and counts how many times the target substring appears. My initial approach did not account for existing occurrences properly, leading to incorrect results.\n\n2. **Handling Question Marks**: The official solution has a clear strategy for replacing question marks. It first checks if \"abacaba\" is already present. If it is not, it attempts to place \"abacaba\" in every possible position while replacing question marks with the necessary characters. If a valid configuration is found, it replaces any remaining question marks with 'z'. My approach did not adequately ensure that the final string had \"abacaba\" appearing exactly once.\n\n3. **Early Exit Conditions**: The official solution includes early exit conditions. If \"abacaba\" is found more than once, it immediately returns \"No\". This prevents unnecessary computations and simplifies the logic. My solution lacked this efficiency, leading to more complex checks after placements.\n\n4. **Final String Construction**: The official solution constructs the final string only after confirming that \"abacaba\" can be placed correctly. It ensures that the final string meets the criteria before outputting it. My approach attempted to construct the string in a less structured manner, which led to incorrect outputs.\n\nOverall, the official solution is more structured and efficient, focusing on clear checks and maintaining the integrity of the substring placement. In future attempts, I will aim to incorporate these strategies, particularly the use of dedicated functions for counting and validating conditions, as well as ensuring early exits to streamline the logic.",
