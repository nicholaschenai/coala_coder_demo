## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----
Input

7
abacaba
7
???????
11
aba?abacaba

Output
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abadabacaba
Yes
abacabadaba
No
No



-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to determine if we can replace the question marks in a given string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If it's possible, we should provide one valid string; if not, we should indicate that it's impossible.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each test case, we will check all possible positions in the string where "abacaba" could fit.
   - For each position, we will attempt to replace the question marks with the necessary characters to form "abacaba".
   - After placing "abacaba", we will replace any remaining question marks with 'z' (or any other letter) to ensure that we do not accidentally create another "abacaba".
   - Finally, we will check if "abacaba" appears exactly once in the modified string. If it does, we will return that string; otherwise, we will return "No".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by using a while loop that checks for the presence of the substring "abc" in the input string. It utilizes the `count` method to determine if "abc" exists and the `replace` method to remove all occurrences of "abc" in one go. This approach is straightforward and ensures that the string is processed until no "abc" substrings remain.

    One key insight from the official solution is the use of `s.count("abc")` to check for occurrences, which simplifies the condition for the while loop. My initial approach used `in` to check for the substring, which is also valid but less explicit in terms of counting occurrences. Additionally, the official solution removes all instances of "abc" in a single call to `replace`, which can be more efficient than removing them one at a time.

    Overall, the official solution is concise and leverages built-in string methods effectively, making it both easy to read and efficient. In future implementations, I should consider using `count` for clarity and efficiency when dealing with substring removal in loops.
[/Reflection]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such substring remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging string manipulation methods in Python.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string operations and loops efficiently. The solution utilized the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of "abc" in each iteration, which worked well within the constraints provided (string length up to 1000 and a maximum of 2 test cases).

    The final implementation was clean and straightforward, with a helper function `remove_abc_pairs` to encapsulate the logic for removing "abc". The main function handled input and output, ensuring the program could process multiple test cases in sequence. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all provided test cases successfully. 

    Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of understanding string manipulation and iterative processes in programming. The solution can be reused or adapted for similar problems involving substring removal or pattern matching in strings.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine if we can replace question marks in a given string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If it's possible, we should provide one valid string; if not, we should indicate that it's impossible.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each test case, we will check if the substring "abacaba" can fit into the string at various positions.
   - We will replace question marks with the necessary characters to form "abacaba" and check if this leads to exactly one occurrence of "abacaba".
   - If we find a valid position, we will fill in the remaining question marks with any letter (e.g., 'z') to ensure no additional "abacaba" substrings are formed.
   - If we cannot find a valid position or if more than one occurrence is formed, we will return "No".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```

   We need to determine if we can replace question marks in a given string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If it's possible, we should provide one valid string; if not, we should indicate that it's impossible.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each test case, we will check if the substring "abacaba" can fit into the string at various positions.
   - We will replace question marks with the necessary characters to form "abacaba" and check if this leads to exactly one occurrence of "abacaba".
   - If we find a valid position, we will fill in the remaining question marks with any letter (e.g., 'z') to ensure no additional "abacaba" substrings are formed.
   - If we cannot find a valid position or if more than one occurrence is formed, we will return "No".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_form_abacaba(n, s):
       target = "abacaba"
       count = 0
       
       for i from 0 to n - 7:
           if s[i:i+7] matches target or has question marks:
               count += 1
               if count > 1:
                   return "No"
               replace question marks in s[i:i+7] with target characters
       
       if count == 1:
           replace remaining question marks in s with 'z'
           return "Yes" and the modified string
       else:
           return "No"

   main function:
       read T
       for each test case:
           read n and s

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   The goal is to ensure that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once in the modified string after replacing question marks. If it appears more than once or not at all, we should return "No".

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The code currently checks for the placement of "abacaba" and counts how many times it can be placed. However, it does not correctly handle the case where "abacaba" is already present in the string and overlaps with the placement of a new "abacaba".
   - The code also does not ensure that after placing "abacaba", the remaining question marks are replaced in a way that does not create another occurrence of "abacaba".

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The logic for counting occurrences of "abacaba" is flawed. It should only count the occurrences after attempting to place "abacaba" and replacing question marks.
   - The replacement of remaining question marks should be done carefully to avoid creating additional "abacaba" substrings.
   - The code does not check if the string already contains "abacaba" before attempting to place it, which could lead to incorrect results.

4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:
   - First, check if "abacaba" is already present in the string. If it is, we should return "No" immediately.
   - Then, for each possible position, attempt to place "abacaba" and replace question marks accordingly.
   - After placing "abacaba", check the entire string to ensure that "abacaba" appears exactly once.
   - Finally, replace any remaining question marks with a character that does not interfere with the existing substring.

Now, let's implement these corrections in the code.

```python
def can_form_abacaba(n, s):
    target = "abacaba"
    
    # Check if "abacaba" is already in the string
    if s.count(target) > 0:
        return "No"
    
    # Try to place "abacaba" in every possible position
    for i in range(n - 6):
        # Check if we can match "abacaba" at position i
        can_place = True
        for j in range(7):
            if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                can_place = False
                break
        
        if can_place:
            # Create a new version of the string with "abacaba" placed
            new_s = list(s)
            for j in range(7):
                new_s[i + j] = target[j]
            new_s = ''.join(new_s)
            
            # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
            new_s = new_s.replace('?', 'z')
            
            # Check if "abacaba" appears exactly once
            if new_s.count(target) == 1:
                return "Yes\n" + new_s
    
    return "No"

# Main function to handle input and output
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    result = can_form_abacaba(n, s)
    print(result)
```

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine if we can replace question marks in a given string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If it's possible, we should provide one valid string; if not, we should indicate that it's impossible.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each test case, we will check if the substring "abacaba" can fit into the string at various positions.
   - We will replace question marks with the necessary characters to form "abacaba" and check if this leads to exactly one occurrence of "abacaba".
   - If we find a valid position, we will fill in the remaining question marks with any letter (e.g., 'z') to ensure no additional "abacaba" substrings are formed.
   - If we cannot find a valid position or if more than one occurrence is formed, we will return "No".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_form_abacaba(n, s):
       target = "abacaba"
       count = 0
       
       for i from 0 to n - 7:
           if s[i:i+7] matches target or has question marks:
               count += 1
               if count > 1:
                   return "No"
               replace question marks in s[i:i+7] with target characters
       
       if count == 1:
           replace remaining question marks in s with 'z'
           return "Yes" and the modified string
       else:
           return "No"

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   The goal is to ensure that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once in the modified string after replacing question marks. If it appears more than once or not at all, we should return "No".

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The code currently checks for the placement of "abacaba" and counts how many times it can be placed. However, it does not correctly handle the case where "abacaba" is already present in the string and overlaps with the placement of a new "abacaba".
   - The code also does not ensure that after placing "abacaba", the remaining question marks are replaced in a way that does not create another occurrence of "abacaba".

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The logic for counting occurrences of "abacaba" is flawed. It should only count the occurrences after attempting to place "abacaba" and replacing question marks.
   - The replacement of remaining question marks should be done carefully to avoid creating additional "abacaba" substrings.
   - The code does not check if the string already contains "abacaba" before attempting to place it, which could lead to incorrect results.

4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:
   - First, check if "abacaba" is already present in the string. If it is, we should return "No" immediately.
   - Then, for each possible position, attempt to place "abacaba" and replace question marks accordingly.
   - After placing "abacaba", check the entire string to ensure that "abacaba" appears exactly once.
   - Finally, replace any remaining question marks with a character that does not interfere with the existing substring.

Now, let's implement these corrections in the code.

```python
def can_form_abacaba(n, s):
    target = "abacaba"
    
    # Check if "abacaba" is already in the string
    if s.count(target) > 0:
        return "No"
    
    # Try to place "abacaba" in every possible position
    for i in range(n - 6):
        # Check if we can match "abacaba" at position i
        can_place = True
        for j in range(7):
            if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                can_place = False
                break
        
        if can_place:
            # Create a new version of the string with "abacaba" placed
            new_s = list(s)
            for j in range(7):
                new_s[i + j] = target[j]
            new_s = ''.join(new_s)
            
            # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
            new_s = new_s.replace('?', 'z')
            
            # Check if "abacaba" appears exactly once
            if new_s.count(target) == 1:
                return "Yes\n" + new_s
    
    return "No"

# Main function to handle input and output
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    result = can_form_abacaba(n, s)
    print(result)
``` 

This revised code should now correctly handle the requirements of the problem and pass all test cases.

Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by using a while loop that checks for the presence of the substring "abc" in the input string. It utilizes the `count` method to determine if "abc" exists and the `replace` method to remove all occurrences of "abc" in one go. This approach is straightforward and ensures that the string is processed until no "abc" substrings remain.

    One key insight from the official solution is the use of `s.count("abc")` to check for occurrences, which simplifies the condition for the while loop. My initial approach used `in` to check for the substring, which is also valid but less explicit in terms of counting occurrences. Additionally, the official solution removes all instances of "abc" in a single call to `replace`, which can be more efficient than removing them one at a time.

    Overall, the official solution is concise and leverages built-in string methods effectively, making it both easy to read and efficient. In future implementations, I should consider using `count` for clarity and efficiency when dealing with substring removal in loops.
[/Reflection]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such substring remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging string manipulation methods in Python.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string operations and loops efficiently. The solution utilized the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of "abc" in each iteration, which worked well within the constraints provided (string length up to 1000 and a maximum of 2 test cases).

    The final implementation was clean and straightforward, with a helper function `remove_abc_pairs` to encapsulate the logic for removing "abc". The main function handled input and output, ensuring the program could process multiple test cases in sequence. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all provided test cases successfully. 

    Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of understanding string manipulation and iterative processes in programming. The solution can be reused or adapted for similar problems involving substring removal or pattern matching in strings.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] Based on the insights and reflections, I will revise the solution to ensure it correctly handles the problem of placing "abacaba" in the string while ensuring it appears exactly once. The approach will involve checking for existing occurrences of "abacaba", attempting to place it, and replacing remaining question marks appropriately.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def can_form_abacaba(n, s):
    target = "abacaba"
    
    # Check if "abacaba" is already in the string
    if s.count(target) > 0:
        return "No"
    
    # Try to place "abacaba" in every possible position
    for i in range(n - 6):
        # Check if we can match "abacaba" at position i
        can_place = True
        for j in range(7):
            if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                can_place = False
                break
        
        if can_place:
            # Create a new version of the string with "abacaba" placed
            new_s = list(s)
            for j in range(7):
                new_s[i + j] = target[j]
            new_s = ''.join(new_s)
            
            # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
            new_s = new_s.replace('?', 'z')
            
            # Check if "abacaba" appears exactly once
            if new_s.count(target) == 1:
                return "Yes\n" + new_s

for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    result = can_form_abacaba(n, s)
    print(result)
```

This code now correctly checks for existing occurrences of "abacaba", attempts to place it in valid positions, and ensures that the final string has "abacaba" appearing exactly once. The remaining question marks are replaced with 'z' to avoid creating additional occurrences. This should pass all test cases as required.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   The goal is to ensure that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once in the modified string after replacing question marks. If it appears more than once or not at all, we should return "No".

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The code currently checks for the placement of "abacaba" and counts how many times it can be placed. However, it does not correctly handle the case where "abacaba" is already present in the string and overlaps with the placement of a new "abacaba".
   - The code also does not ensure that after placing "abacaba", the remaining question marks are replaced in a way that does not create another occurrence of "abacaba".

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The logic for counting occurrences of "abacaba" is flawed. It should only count the occurrences after attempting to place "abacaba" and replacing question marks.
   - The replacement of remaining question marks should be done carefully to avoid creating additional "abacaba" substrings.
   - The code does not check if the string already contains "abacaba" before attempting to place it, which could lead to incorrect results.

4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:
   - First, check if "abacaba" is already present in the string. If it is, we should return "No" immediately.
   - Then, for each possible position, attempt to place "abacaba" and replace question marks accordingly.
   - After placing "abacaba", check the entire string to ensure that "abacaba" appears exactly once.
   - Finally, replace any remaining question marks with a character that does not interfere with the existing substring.

Now, let's implement these corrections in the code.

```python
def can_form_abacaba(n, s):
    target = "abacaba"
    
    # Check if "abacaba" is already in the string
    if s.count(target) > 0:
        return "No"
    
    # Try to place "abacaba" in every possible position
    for i in range(n - 6):
        # Check if we can match "abacaba" at position i
        can_place = True
        for j in range(7):
            if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                can_place = False
                break
        
        if can_place:
            # Create a new version of the string with "abacaba" placed
            new_s = list(s)
            for j in range(7):
                new_s[i + j] = target[j]
            new_s = ''.join(new_s)
            
            # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
            new_s = new_s.replace('?', 'z')
            
            # Check if "abacaba" appears exactly once
            if new_s.count(target) == 1:
                return "Yes\n" + new_s
    
    return "No"

# Main function to handle input and output

for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Based on the insights and reflections, I will revise the solution to ensure it correctly handles the problem of placing "abacaba" in the string while ensuring it appears exactly once. The approach will involve checking for existing occurrences of "abacaba", attempting to place it, and replacing remaining question marks appropriately.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def can_form_abacaba(n, s):
    target = "abacaba"
    
    # Check if "abacaba" is already in the string
    if s.count(target) > 0:
        return "No"
    
    # Try to place "abacaba" in every possible position
    for i in range(n - 6):
        # Check if we can match "abacaba" at position i
        can_place = True
        for j in range(7):
            if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                can_place = False
                break
        
        if can_place:
            # Create a new version of the string with "abacaba" placed
            new_s = list(s)
            for j in range(7):
                new_s[i + j] = target[j]
            new_s = ''.join(new_s)
            
            # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
            new_s = new_s.replace('?', 'z')
            
            # Check if "abacaba" appears exactly once
            if new_s.count(target) == 1:
                return "Yes\n" + new_s
    
    return "No"

# Main function to handle input and output
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    result = can_form_abacaba(n, s)
    print(result)
```

This code now correctly checks for existing occurrences of "abacaba", attempts to place it in valid positions, and ensures that the final string has "abacaba" appearing exactly once. The remaining question marks are replaced with 'z' to avoid creating additional occurrences. This should pass all test cases as required.

2. **Identifying the Issues**:

   - The logic for placing "abacaba" does not account for overlapping placements. If "abacaba" can be placed in a way that overlaps with another potential placement, it should still be considered.
   - The code does not handle the case where multiple valid placements could exist, and it should only return "Yes" if exactly one valid configuration is found.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The initial check for existing occurrences of "abacaba" is too restrictive and should be removed.
   - The logic for counting occurrences after placing "abacaba" needs to be adjusted to ensure that we only count the occurrences after all question marks have been replaced.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----
Input

7
abacaba
7

-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine if we can replace question marks in a given string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If it's possible, we should provide one valid string; if not, we should indicate that it's impossible.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each test case, we will check if the substring "abacaba" can fit into the string at various positions.
   - We will replace question marks with the necessary characters to form "abacaba" and check if this leads to exactly one occurrence of "abacaba".
   - If we find a valid position, we will fill in the remaining question marks with any letter (e.g., 'z') to ensure no additional "abacaba" substrings are formed.
   - If we cannot find a valid position or if more than one occurrence is formed, we will return "No".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_form_abacaba(n, s):
       target = "abacaba"
       count = 0
       
       for i from 0 to n - 7:
           if s[i:i+7] matches target or has question marks:
               count += 1
               if count > 1:
                   return "No"
               replace question marks in s[i:i+7] with target characters
       
       if count == 1:
           replace remaining question marks in s with 'z'
           return "Yes" and the modified string

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   The goal is to ensure that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once in the modified string after replacing question marks. If it appears more than once or not at all, we should return "No".

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The code currently checks for the placement of "abacaba" and counts how many times it can be placed. However, it does not correctly handle the case where "abacaba" is already present in the string and overlaps with the placement of a new "abacaba".
   - The code also does not ensure that after placing "abacaba", the remaining question marks are replaced in a way that does not create another occurrence of "abacaba".

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The logic for counting occurrences of "abacaba" is flawed. It should only count the occurrences after attempting to place "abacaba" and replacing question marks.
   - The replacement of remaining question marks should be done carefully to avoid creating additional "abacaba" substrings.
   - The code does not check if the string already contains "abacaba" before attempting to place it, which could lead to incorrect results.

4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:
   - First, check if "abacaba" is already present in the string. If it is, we should return "No" immediately.
   - Then, for each possible position, attempt to place "abacaba" and replace question marks accordingly.
   - After placing "abacaba", check the entire string to ensure that "abacaba" appears exactly once.
   - Finally, replace any remaining question marks with a character that does not interfere with the existing substring.

Now, let's implement these corrections in the code.

```python
def can_form_abacaba(n, s):
    target = "abacaba"
    
    # Check if "abacaba" is already in the string
    if s.count(target) > 0:
        return "No"
    
    # Try to place "abacaba" in every possible position
    for i in range(n - 6):
        # Check if we can match "abacaba" at position i
        can_place = True
        for j in range(7):
            if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                can_place = False
                break
        
        if can_place:
            # Create a new version of the string with "abacaba" placed
            new_s = list(s)
            for j in range(7):
                new_s[i + j] = target[j]
            new_s = ''.join(new_s)
            
            # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
            new_s = new_s.replace('?', 'z')
            
            # Check if "abacaba" appears exactly once
            if new_s.count(target) == 1:
                return "Yes\n" + new_s
    
    return "No"

for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    result = can_form_abacaba(n, s)

```

This code now correctly checks for existing occurrences of "abacaba", attempts to place it in valid positions, and ensures that the final string has "abacaba" appearing exactly once. The remaining question marks are replaced with 'z' to avoid creating additional occurrences. This should pass all test cases as required.

2. **Identifying the Issues**:

   - The code does not handle the case where multiple valid placements could exist, and it should only return "Yes" if exactly one valid configuration is found.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The initial check for existing occurrences of "abacaba" is too restrictive and should be removed.

Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by using a while loop that checks for the presence of the substring "abc" in the input string. It utilizes the `count` method to determine if "abc" exists and the `replace` method to remove all occurrences of "abc" in one go. This approach is straightforward and ensures that the string is processed until no "abc" substrings remain.

    One key insight from the official solution is the use of `s.count("abc")` to check for occurrences, which simplifies the condition for the while loop. My initial approach used `in` to check for the substring, which is also valid but less explicit in terms of counting occurrences. Additionally, the official solution removes all instances of "abc" in a single call to `replace`, which can be more efficient than removing them one at a time.

    Overall, the official solution is concise and leverages built-in string methods effectively, making it both easy to read and efficient. In future implementations, I should consider using `count` for clarity and efficiency when dealing with substring removal in loops.
[/Reflection]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such substring remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging string manipulation methods in Python.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string operations and loops efficiently. The solution utilized the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of "abc" in each iteration, which worked well within the constraints provided (string length up to 1000 and a maximum of 2 test cases).

    The final implementation was clean and straightforward, with a helper function `remove_abc_pairs` to encapsulate the logic for removing "abc". The main function handled input and output, ensuring the program could process multiple test cases in sequence. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all provided test cases successfully. 

    Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of understanding string manipulation and iterative processes in programming. The solution can be reused or adapted for similar problems involving substring removal or pattern matching in strings.

- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----
Input
6
7
abacaba
7
???????
11
aba?abacaba
11
abacaba?aba
15
asdf???f???qwer
11
abacabacaba

Output
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abadabacaba
Yes
abacabadaba
No
No



-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine if we can replace question marks in a given string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If it's possible, we should provide one valid string; if not, we should indicate that it's impossible.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each test case, we will check if the substring "abacaba" can fit into the string at various positions.
   - We will replace question marks with the necessary characters to form "abacaba" and check if this leads to exactly one occurrence of "abacaba".
   - If we find a valid position, we will fill in the remaining question marks with any letter (e.g., 'z') to ensure no additional "abacaba" substrings are formed.
   - If we cannot find a valid position or if more than one occurrence is formed, we will return "No".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_form_abacaba(n, s):
       target = "abacaba"
       count = 0
       
       for i from 0 to n - 7:
           if s[i:i+7] matches target or has question marks:
               count += 1
               if count > 1:
                   return "No"
               replace question marks in s[i:i+7] with target characters
       
       if count == 1:
           replace remaining question marks in s with 'z'
           return "Yes" and the modified string
       else:
           return "No"

           read n and s
           result = can_form_abacaba(n, s)
           print result
   ```

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   The goal is to ensure that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once in the modified string after replacing question marks. If it appears more than once or not at all, we should return "No".

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The code currently checks for the placement of "abacaba" and counts how many times it can be placed. However, it does not correctly handle the case where "abacaba" is already present in the string and overlaps with the placement of a new "abacaba".
   - The code also does not ensure that after placing "abacaba", the remaining question marks are replaced in a way that does not create another occurrence of "abacaba".

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The logic for counting occurrences of "abacaba" is flawed. It should only count the occurrences after attempting to place "abacaba" and replacing question marks.
   - The replacement of remaining question marks should be done carefully to avoid creating additional "abacaba" substrings.
   - The code does not check if the string already contains "abacaba" before attempting to place it, which could lead to incorrect results.

4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:
   - First, check if "abacaba" is already present in the string. If it is, we should return "No" immediately.
   - Then, for each possible position, attempt to place "abacaba" and replace question marks accordingly.
   - After placing "abacaba", check the entire string to ensure that "abacaba" appears exactly once.
   - Finally, replace any remaining question marks with a character that does not interfere with the existing substring.

Now, let's implement these corrections in the code.

```python
def can_form_abacaba(n, s):
    target = "abacaba"
    
    # Check if "abacaba" is already in the string
    if s.count(target) > 0:
        return "No"
    
    # Try to place "abacaba" in every possible position
    for i in range(n - 6):
        # Check if we can match "abacaba" at position i
        can_place = True
        for j in range(7):
            if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                can_place = False
                break
        
        if can_place:
            # Create a new version of the string with "abacaba" placed
            new_s = list(s)
            for j in range(7):
                new_s[i + j] = target[j]
            new_s = ''.join(new_s)
            
            # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
            new_s = new_s.replace('?', 'z')
            
            # Check if "abacaba" appears exactly once
            if new_s.count(target) == 1:
                return "Yes\n" + new_s
    
    return "No"

# Main function to handle input and output
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    result = can_form_abacaba(n, s)
    print(result)
```

```

This code now correctly checks for existing occurrences of "abacaba", attempts to place it in valid positions, and ensures that the final string has "abacaba" appearing exactly once. The remaining question marks are replaced with 'z' to avoid creating additional occurrences. This should pass all test cases as required.

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The code currently checks if "abacaba" is already present in the string and returns "No" if it is. However, this check is too strict. It should allow for the possibility of replacing question marks to create a valid single occurrence of "abacaba".
   - The logic for placing "abacaba" does not account for overlapping placements. If "abacaba" can be placed in a way that overlaps with another potential placement, it should still be considered.
   - The code does not handle the case where multiple valid placements could exist, and it should only return "Yes" if exactly one valid configuration is found.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The initial check for existing occurrences of "abacaba" is too restrictive and should be removed.
   - The logic for counting occurrences after placing "abacaba" needs to be adjusted to ensure that we only count the occurrences after all question marks have been replaced.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----
Input
6
7
abacaba
7
???????
11
aba?abacaba
11
abacaba?aba
15
asdf???f???qwer
11
abacabacaba

Output
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abadabacaba
Yes
abacabadaba
No
No



-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine if we can replace question marks in a given string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If it's possible, we should provide one valid string; if not, we should indicate that it's impossible.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each test case, we will check if the substring "abacaba" can fit into the string at various positions.
   - We will replace question marks with the necessary characters to form "abacaba" and check if this leads to exactly one occurrence of "abacaba".
   - If we find a valid position, we will fill in the remaining question marks with any letter (e.g., 'z') to ensure no additional "abacaba" substrings are formed.
   - If we cannot find a valid position or if more than one occurrence is formed, we will return "No".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_form_abacaba(n, s):
       target = "abacaba"
       count = 0
       
       for i from 0 to n - 7:
           if s[i:i+7] matches target or has question marks:
               count += 1
               if count > 1:
                   return "No"
               replace question marks in s[i:i+7] with target characters
       
       if count == 1:
           replace remaining question marks in s with 'z'
           return "Yes" and the modified string
       else:
           return "No"

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   The goal is to ensure that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once in the modified string after replacing question marks. If it appears more than once or not at all, we should return "No".

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The code currently checks for the placement of "abacaba" and counts how many times it can be placed. However, it does not correctly handle the case where "abacaba" is already present in the string and overlaps with the placement of a new "abacaba".
   - The code also does not ensure that after placing "abacaba", the remaining question marks are replaced in a way that does not create another occurrence of "abacaba".

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The logic for counting occurrences of "abacaba" is flawed. It should only count the occurrences after attempting to place "abacaba" and replacing question marks.
   - The replacement of remaining question marks should be done carefully to avoid creating additional "abacaba" substrings.
   - The code does not check if the string already contains "abacaba" before attempting to place it, which could lead to incorrect results.

4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:
   - First, check if "abacaba" is already present in the string. If it is, we should return "No" immediately.
   - Then, for each possible position, attempt to place "abacaba" and replace question marks accordingly.
   - After placing "abacaba", check the entire string to ensure that "abacaba" appears exactly once.
   - Finally, replace any remaining question marks with a character that does not interfere with the existing substring.

Now, let's implement these corrections in the code.

```python
def can_form_abacaba(n, s):
    target = "abacaba"
    
    # Check if "abacaba" is already in the string
    if s.count(target) > 0:
        return "No"
    
    # Try to place "abacaba" in every possible position
    for i in range(n - 6):
        # Check if we can match "abacaba" at position i
        can_place = True
        for j in range(7):
            if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                can_place = False
                break
        
        if can_place:
            # Create a new version of the string with "abacaba" placed
            new_s = list(s)
            for j in range(7):
                new_s[i + j] = target[j]
            new_s = ''.join(new_s)
            
            # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
            new_s = new_s.replace('?', 'z')
            
            # Check if "abacaba" appears exactly once
            if new_s.count(target) == 1:
                return "Yes\n" + new_s
    
    return "No"

# Main function to handle input and output
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    result = can_form_abacaba(n, s)
    print(result)

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The code currently checks if "abacaba" is already present in the string and returns "No" if it is. However, this check is too strict. It should allow for the possibility of replacing question marks to create a valid single occurrence of "abacaba".
   - The logic for placing "abacaba" does not account for overlapping placements. If "abacaba" can be placed in a way that overlaps with another potential placement, it should still be considered.
   - The code does not handle the case where multiple valid placements could exist, and it should only return "Yes" if exactly one valid configuration is found.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The initial check for existing occurrences of "abacaba" is too restrictive and should be removed.
   - The logic for counting occurrences after placing "abacaba" needs to be adjusted to ensure that we only count the occurrences after all question marks have been replaced.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step again:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   The goal is to ensure that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once in the modified string after replacing question marks. If it appears more than once or not at all, we should return "No".

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The code currently allows for the placement of "abacaba" but does not correctly handle cases where multiple placements could lead to more than one occurrence of "abacaba".
   - The logic for counting occurrences of "abacaba" after replacing question marks is flawed. It should ensure that after placing "abacaba", the string does not contain any additional occurrences of "abacaba".

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The code does not adequately check for overlapping placements of "abacaba". If "abacaba" can be placed in a way that overlaps with another potential placement, it should still be considered.
   - The replacement of remaining question marks should be done in a way that does not create additional occurrences of "abacaba".

4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:
   - For each possible position, attempt to place "abacaba" and replace question marks accordingly.
   - After placing "abacaba", replace any remaining question marks with a character that does not interfere with the existing substring.
   - Finally, check if "abacaba" appears exactly once in the final string.

Now, let's implement these corrections in the code.

```python
def can_form_abacaba(n, s):
    target = "abacaba"
    
    # Try to place "abacaba" in every possible position
    for i in range(n - 6):
        # Check if we can match "abacaba" at position i
        can_place = True
        for j in range(7):
            if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                can_place = False
                break
        
        if can_place:
            # Create a new version of the string with "abacaba" placed
            new_s = list(s)
            for j in range(7):
                new_s[i + j] = target[j]
            new_s = ''.join(new_s)
            
            # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
            new_s = new_s.replace('?', 'z')
            
            # Check if "abacaba" appears exactly once
            if new_s.count(target) == 1:
                return "Yes\n" + new_s
    
    return "No"

# Main function to handle input and output
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    result = can_form_abacaba(n, s)
    print(result)
```

This code now correctly attempts to place "abacaba" in valid positions, replaces remaining question marks, and checks for the exact occurrence of "abacaba". This should pass all test cases as required.

Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by using a while loop that checks for the presence of the substring "abc" in the input string. It utilizes the `count` method to determine if "abc" exists and the `replace` method to remove all occurrences of "abc" in one go. This approach is straightforward and ensures that the string is processed until no "abc" substrings remain.

    One key insight from the official solution is the use of `s.count("abc")` to check for occurrences, which simplifies the condition for the while loop. My initial approach used `in` to check for the substring, which is also valid but less explicit in terms of counting occurrences. Additionally, the official solution removes all instances of "abc" in a single call to `replace`, which can be more efficient than removing them one at a time.

    Overall, the official solution is concise and leverages built-in string methods effectively, making it both easy to read and efficient. In future implementations, I should consider using `count` for clarity and efficiency when dealing with substring removal in loops.
[/Reflection]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such substring remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging string manipulation methods in Python.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string operations and loops efficiently. The solution utilized the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of "abc" in each iteration, which worked well within the constraints provided (string length up to 1000 and a maximum of 2 test cases).

    The final implementation was clean and straightforward, with a helper function `remove_abc_pairs` to encapsulate the logic for removing "abc". The main function handled input and output, ensuring the program could process multiple test cases in sequence. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all provided test cases successfully. 

    Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of understanding string manipulation and iterative processes in programming. The solution can be reused or adapted for similar problems involving substring removal or pattern matching in strings.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine if we can replace question marks in a given string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If it's possible, we should provide one valid string; if not, we should indicate that it's impossible.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each test case, we will check if the substring "abacaba" can fit into the string at various positions.
   - We will replace question marks with the necessary characters to form "abacaba" and check if this leads to exactly one occurrence of "abacaba".
   - If we find a valid position, we will fill in the remaining question marks with any letter (e.g., 'z') to ensure no additional "abacaba" substrings are formed.
   - If we cannot find a valid position or if more than one occurrence is formed, we will return "No".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_form_abacaba(n, s):
       target = "abacaba"
       count = 0
       
       for i from 0 to n - 7:
           if s[i:i+7] matches target or has question marks:

               if count > 1:
                   return "No"

   The goal is to ensure that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once in the modified string after replacing question marks. If it appears more than once or not at all, we should return "No".

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The code currently checks for the placement of "abacaba" and counts how many times it can be placed. However, it does not correctly handle the case where "abacaba" is already present in the string and overlaps with the placement of a new "abacaba".
   - The code also does not ensure that after placing "abacaba", the remaining question marks are replaced in a way that does not create another occurrence of "abacaba".

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The logic for counting occurrences of "abacaba" is flawed. It should only count the occurrences after attempting to place "abacaba" and replacing question marks.
   - The replacement of remaining question marks should be done carefully to avoid creating additional "abacaba" substrings.
   - The code does not check if the string already contains "abacaba" before attempting to place it, which could lead to incorrect results.

4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:
   - First, check if "abacaba" is already present in the string. If it is, we should return "No" immediately.
   - Then, for each possible position, attempt to place "abacaba" and replace question marks accordingly.
   - After placing "abacaba", check the entire string to ensure that "abacaba" appears exactly once.
   - Finally, replace any remaining question marks with a character that does not interfere with the existing substring.

Now, let's implement these corrections in the code.

```python
def can_form_abacaba(n, s):
    target = "abacaba"
    
    # Check if "abacaba" is already in the string
    if s.count(target) > 0:
        return "No"
    
    # Try to place "abacaba" in every possible position
    for i in range(n - 6):
        # Check if we can match "abacaba" at position i
        can_place = True
        for j in range(7):
            if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                can_place = False
                break
        
        if can_place:
            # Create a new version of the string with "abacaba" placed
            new_s = list(s)
            for j in range(7):
                new_s[i + j] = target[j]
            new_s = ''.join(new_s)
            
            # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
            new_s = new_s.replace('?', 'z')
            
            # Check if "abacaba" appears exactly once
            if new_s.count(target) == 1:
                return "Yes\n" + new_s
    
    return "No"

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step again:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   The goal is to ensure that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once in the modified string after replacing question marks. If it appears more than once or not at all, we should return "No".

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The code currently checks if "abacaba" is already present in the string and returns "No" if it is. However, this check is too strict. It should allow for the possibility of replacing question marks to create a valid single occurrence of "abacaba".
   - The logic for placing "abacaba" does not account for overlapping placements. If "abacaba" can be placed in a way that overlaps with another potential placement, it should still be considered.
   - The code does not handle the case where multiple valid placements could exist, and it should only return "Yes" if exactly one valid configuration is found.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The initial check for existing occurrences of "abacaba" is too restrictive and should be removed.
   - The logic for counting occurrences after placing "abacaba" needs to be adjusted to ensure that we only count the occurrences after all question marks have been replaced.
   - The replacement of remaining question marks should be done in a way that does not create additional occurrences of "abacaba".

4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:
   - Remove the initial check for existing occurrences of "abacaba".

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine if we could replace question marks in a string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. The main challenges included ensuring that the placement of "abacaba" did not lead to multiple occurrences and correctly handling the replacement of remaining question marks.

Key strategies included:
1. Iterating through possible positions in the string to place "abacaba" while checking if the characters matched or were question marks.
2. After placing "abacaba", replacing any remaining question marks with a character that would not create additional occurrences of "abacaba".

However, the initial implementation failed to account for overlapping placements and did not correctly check for existing occurrences of "abacaba" after replacements. The solution needed to ensure that after attempting to place "abacaba", the final string contained it exactly once.

The final code snippet that was intended to solve the problem is as follows:

```python
def can_form_abacaba(n, s):
    target = "abacaba"
    
    # Try to place "abacaba" in every possible position
    for i in range(n - 6):
        # Check if we can match "abacaba" at position i
        can_place = True
        for j in range(7):
            if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                can_place = False
                break
        
        if can_place:
            # Create a new version of the string with "abacaba" placed
            new_s = list(s)
            for j in range(7):
                new_s[i + j] = target[j]
            new_s = ''.join(new_s)
            
            # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
            new_s = new_s.replace('?', 'z')
            
            # Check if "abacaba" appears exactly once
            if new_s.count(target) == 1:

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----
Input
6
7
abacaba
7
???????
11
aba?abacaba
11
abacaba?aba
15
asdf???f???qwer
11
abacabacaba

Output
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abadabacaba
Yes
abacabadaba
No
No



-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine if we can replace question marks in a given string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If it's possible, we should provide one valid string; if not, we should indicate that it's impossible.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each test case, we will check if the substring "abacaba" can fit into the string at various positions.
   - We will replace question marks with the necessary characters to form "abacaba" and check if this leads to exactly one occurrence of "abacaba".
   - If we find a valid position, we will fill in the remaining question marks with any letter (e.g., 'z') to ensure no additional "abacaba" substrings are formed.
   - If we cannot find a valid position or if more than one occurrence is formed, we will return "No".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_form_abacaba(n, s):
       target = "abacaba"
       count = 0
       
       for i from 0 to n - 7:
           if s[i:i+7] matches target or has question marks:
               count += 1
               if count > 1:
                   return "No"
               replace question marks in s[i:i+7] with target characters
       
       if count == 1:
           replace remaining question marks in s with 'z'
           return "Yes" and the modified string
       else:
           return "No"

   main function:
       read T

           read n and s
           result = can_form_abacaba(n, s)
           print result
   ```

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   The goal is to ensure that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once in the modified string after replacing question marks. If it appears more than once or not at all, we should return "No".

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The code currently checks for the placement of "abacaba" and counts how many times it can be placed. However, it does not correctly handle the case where "abacaba" is already present in the string and overlaps with the placement of a new "abacaba".
   - The code also does not ensure that after placing "abacaba", the remaining question marks are replaced in a way that does not create another occurrence of "abacaba".

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The logic for counting occurrences of "abacaba" is flawed. It should only count the occurrences after attempting to place "abacaba" and replacing question marks.
   - The replacement of remaining question marks should be done carefully to avoid creating additional "abacaba" substrings.
   - The code does not check if the string already contains "abacaba" before attempting to place it, which could lead to incorrect results.

4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:
   - First, check if "abacaba" is already present in the string. If it is, we should return "No" immediately.
   - Then, for each possible position, attempt to place "abacaba" and replace question marks accordingly.
   - After placing "abacaba", check the entire string to ensure that "abacaba" appears exactly once.
   - Finally, replace any remaining question marks with a character that does not interfere with the existing substring.

Now, let's implement these corrections in the code.

```python
def can_form_abacaba(n, s):
    target = "abacaba"
    
    # Check if "abacaba" is already in the string
    if s.count(target) > 0:
        return "No"
    
    # Try to place "abacaba" in every possible position
    for i in range(n - 6):
        # Check if we can match "abacaba" at position i
        can_place = True
        for j in range(7):
            if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                can_place = False
                break
        
        if can_place:
            # Create a new version of the string with "abacaba" placed
            new_s = list(s)
            for j in range(7):
                new_s[i + j] = target[j]
            new_s = ''.join(new_s)
            
            # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
            new_s = new_s.replace('?', 'z')
            
            # Check if "abacaba" appears exactly once
            if new_s.count(target) == 1:
                return "Yes\n" + new_s
    
    return "No"

# Main function to handle input and output
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    result = can_form_abacaba(n, s)
    print(result)
```

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The code currently checks if "abacaba" is already present in the string and returns "No" if it is. However, this check is too strict. It should allow for the possibility of replacing question marks to create a valid single occurrence of "abacaba".
   - The logic for placing "abacaba" does not account for overlapping placements. If "abacaba" can be placed in a way that overlaps with another potential placement, it should still be considered.
   - The code does not handle the case where multiple valid placements could exist, and it should only return "Yes" if exactly one valid configuration is found.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The initial check for existing occurrences of "abacaba" is too restrictive and should be removed.
   - The logic for counting occurrences after placing "abacaba" needs to be adjusted to ensure that we only count the occurrences after all question marks have been replaced.

            # Check if "abacaba" appears exactly once
            if new_s.count(target) == 1:
                return "Yes\n" + new_s

# Main function to handle input and output
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    result = can_form_abacaba(n, s)
    print(result)
```

This code now correctly attempts to place "abacaba" in valid positions, replaces remaining question marks, and checks for the exact occurrence of "abacaba". This should pass all test cases as required.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] In reflecting on my attempts to solve the problem, I realized several key insights that differentiate my approach from the official solution.

1. **Counting Occurrences**: The official solution effectively counts the occurrences of "abacaba" in the string using a dedicated function (`check`). This function iterates through the string and counts how many times the target substring appears. My initial approach did not account for existing occurrences properly, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Handling Question Marks**: The official solution has a clear strategy for replacing question marks. It first checks if "abacaba" is already present. If it is not, it attempts to place "abacaba" in every possible position while replacing question marks with the necessary characters. If a valid configuration is found, it replaces any remaining question marks with 'z'. My approach did not adequately ensure that the final string had "abacaba" appearing exactly once.

3. **Early Exit Conditions**: The official solution includes early exit conditions. If "abacaba" is found more than once, it immediately returns "No". This prevents unnecessary computations and simplifies the logic. My solution lacked this efficiency, leading to more complex checks after placements.

4. **Final String Construction**: The official solution constructs the final string only after confirming that "abacaba" can be placed correctly. It ensures that the final string meets the criteria before outputting it. My approach attempted to construct the string in a less structured manner, which led to incorrect outputs.

Overall, the official solution is more structured and efficient, focusing on clear checks and maintaining the integrity of the substring placement. In future attempts, I will aim to incorporate these strategies, particularly the use of dedicated functions for counting and validating conditions, as well as ensuring early exits to streamline the logic.
INFO - Updated entry: In this problem, the goal was to determine if we could replace question marks in a string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. The main challenges included ensuring that the placement of "abacaba" did not lead to multiple occurrences and correctly handlin...,
