    "summary": "In this task, the goal was to determine if there are two zebras in a jungle that spit at each other based on their positions and spit distances. The solution involved using a dictionary to map each zebra's position to the position it spits to. The core concept was to check for reciprocal spitting, meaning if zebra A spits to zebra B, then zebra B must spit back to zebra A.\n\nThe approach was straightforward: read the input data, store the positions and their target spit positions in a dictionary, and then check for each zebra if its target position exists in the dictionary and if it spits back to the original position. This method efficiently checks for the required condition in linear time.\n\nThe final implementation was successful, passing the provided test case. The code snippet used is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef find_spitting_zebras(t):\n    positions = {}\n    for _ in range(t):\n        a, b = map(int, input().split())\n        target_position = a + b\n        positions[a] = target_position\n    \n    for a in positions:\n        target = positions[a]\n        if target in positions and positions[target] == a:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            return\n    \n    print(\"NO\")\n\nt = int(input())\nfind_spitting_zebras(t)\n```\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of using data structures like dictionaries for efficient lookups and the value of clearly defining the problem's requirements before diving into coding.",
    "reflection": "The official solution effectively solves the problem by using a dictionary to map each zebra's position to the position it spits to. The approach is straightforward and efficient, leveraging the properties of dictionaries for quick lookups.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n1. **Input Handling**: The solution reads the number of zebras and their respective positions and spit distances in a loop, storing the results in a dictionary.\n2. **Dictionary Usage**: By using a dictionary, the solution allows for O(1) average time complexity for checking if a position exists, which is crucial for determining if two zebras spit at each other.\n3. **Reciprocal Check**: The solution checks if the target position of a zebra is also a key in the dictionary and verifies if that zebra spits back to the original position. This two-step check ensures that the solution correctly identifies reciprocal spitting.\n\nMy approach was similar in logic but could have been more concise. The official solution uses a single loop to check for reciprocal spitting after populating the dictionary, which is efficient. I initially included an unnecessary variable to track the result, while the official solution uses a simple flag (`a`) to indicate if a pair was found.\n\nOverall, the official solution is clear and efficient, demonstrating effective use of data structures to solve the problem within the constraints provided. This experience reinforces the importance of leveraging dictionaries for quick lookups in problems involving relationships between elements.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: find_spitting_zebras]\nThe function processes a number of zebras, each defined by their position and the distance they spit, to determine if any two zebras spit at each other reciprocally. It first collects the positions and their corresponding target spit positions in a dictionary. Then, it checks each zebra's target position to see if it points back to the original zebra's position, indicating a mutual spitting relationship. If such a pair is found, it prints \"YES\" and exits; otherwise, it concludes by printing \"NO\" if no pairs are found. The function effectively identifies reciprocal interactions among the zebras based on their spit distances. It operates with a time complexity that allows for efficient checking of these relationships.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to analyze interactions or relationships between entities based on their positions and actions. For example, in game development, you might want to determine if two characters can attack each other based on their locations and attack ranges. Similarly, in simulations involving animals or objects, understanding reciprocal actions can help in modeling behaviors. This problem-solving approach can also be applied in network analysis, where nodes (like zebras) have connections (spits) that can be mutual or reciprocal."
