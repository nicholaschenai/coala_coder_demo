Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.\n\nYou are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.\n\nNow consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).\n\nEach test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.\n\nAs stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.\n\nTest cases are separated by a blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case you are to output a single line containing the value p for which the output of node n is 1 with probability exactly 1/2 if the inputs are independently and randomly set to value 1 with probability p. The value p should be printed with exactly 5 digits after the decimal.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n\n4\n\n1\n0\n\n3\n0\n0\n1 1 2\n\n3\n0\n0\n2 1 2\n\n5\n0\n0\n0\n2 1 2\n1 3 4\n\nOutput:\n\n0.50000\n0.29289\n0.70711\n0.40303\n\n-----Temporary Stuff-----\n\nA horizontal rule follows.\n\n***\n\nHere's a definition list (with `definitionLists` option):\n\napples\n: Good for making applesauce.\noranges\n: Citrus!\ntomatoes\n: There's no \"e\" in tomatoe.\n\n#PRACTICE\n- This must be done\n[http:codechef.com/users/dpraveen](http:codechef.com/users/dpraveen)\n\n(0.8944272\u22120.44721360.4472136\u22120.8944272)(10005)(0.89442720.4472136\u22120.4472136\u22120.8944272)(10005)\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \n0.8944272 & 0.4472136\\\\\n-0.4472136 & -0.8944272\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \n10 & 0\\\\ \n0 & 5\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Each input can independently be set to 1 with probability `p` or to 0 with probability `1-p`.

For an OR gate, the output is 1 if at least one input is 1, which gives us a probability of `1 - (1-p)^2`.

\\key{probability} is a real number between $0$ and $1$\n    that indicates how probable an event is.\n    If an event is certain to happen,\n    its probability is 1,\n    and if an event is impossible,\n    its probability is 0.\n    The probability of an event is denoted $P(\\cdots)$\n    where the three dots describe the event.\n\n    For example, when throwing a dice,\n    the outcome is an integer between $1$ and $6$,\n    and the probability of each outcome is $1/6$.\n    For example, we can calculate the following probabilities:\n\n    \\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]\n    \\item $P(\\textrm{''the outcome is 4''})=1/6$\n    \\item $P(\\textrm{''the outcome is not 6''})=5/6$\n    \\item $P(\\textrm{''the outcome is even''})=1/2$\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    \\section{Calculation}\n\n    To calculate the probability of an event,\n    we can either use combinatorics\n    or simulate the process that generates the event.\n    As an example, let us calculate the probability\n    of drawing three cards with the same value\n    from a shuffled deck of cards\n    (for example, $\\spadesuit 8$, $\\clubsuit 8$ and $\\diamondsuit 8$).\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Method 1}\n\n    We can calculate the probability using the formula\n\n    \\[\\frac{\\textrm{number of desired outcomes}}{\\textrm{total number of outcomes}}.\\]\n\n    In this problem, the desired outcomes are those\n    in which the value of each card is the same.\n    There are $13 {4 \\choose 3}$ such outcomes,\n    because there are $13$ possibilities for the\n    value of the cards and ${4 \\choose 3}$ ways to\n    choose $3$ suits from $4$ possible suits.\n\n    There are a total of ${52 \\choose 3}$ outcomes,\n    because we choose 3 cards from 52 cards.\n    Thus, the probability of the event is\n\n    \\[\\frac{13 {4 \\choose 3}}{{52 \\choose 3}} = \\frac{1}{425}.\\]\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Method 2}\n\n    Another way to calculate the probability is\n    to simulate the process that generates the event.\n    In this example, we draw three cards, so the process\n    consists of three steps.\n    We require that each step of the process is successful.\n\n    Drawing the first card certainly succeeds,\n    because there are no restrictions.\n    The second step succeeds with probability $3/51$,\n    because there are 51 cards left and 3 of them\n    have the same value as the first card.\n    In a similar way, the third step succeeds with probability $2/50$.\n\n    The probability that the entire process succeeds is\n\n    \\[1 \\cdot \\frac{3}{51} \\cdot \\frac{2}{50} = \\frac{1}{425}.\\]\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Probability\n    Section: Events\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Events}\n\n    An event in probability theory can be represented as a set\n    \\[A \\subset X,\\]\n    where $X$ contains all possible outcomes\n    and $A$ is a subset of outcomes.\n    For example, when drawing a dice, the outcomes are\n    \\[X = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}.\\]\n    Now, for example, the event ''the outcome is even''\n    corresponds to the set\n    \\[A = \\{2,4,6\\}.\\]\n\n    Each outcome $x$ is assigned a probability $p(x)$.\n    Then, the probability $P(A)$ of an event\n    $A$ can be calculated as a sum\n    of probabilities of outcomes using the formula\n    \\[P(A) = \\sum_{x \\in A} p(x).\\]\n    For example, when throwing a dice,\n    $p(x)=1/6$ for each outcome $x$,\n    so the probability of the event\n    ''the outcome is even'' is\n    \\[p(2)+p(4)+p(6)=1/2.\\]\n\n    The total probability of the outcomes in $X$ must\n    be 1, i.e., $P(X)=1$.\n\n    Since the events in probability theory are sets,\n    we can manipulate them using standard set operations:\n\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The \\key{complement} $\\bar A$ means\n    ''$A$ does not happen''.\n    For example, when throwing a dice, \n    the complement of $A=\\{2,4,6\\}$ is\n    $\\bar A = \\{1,3,5\\}$.\n    \\item The \\key{union} $A \\cup B$ means\n    ''$A$ or $B$ happen''.\n    For example, the union of\n    $A=\\{2,5\\}$\n    and $B=\\{4,5,6\\}$ is\n    $A \\cup B = \\{2,4,5,6\\}$.\n    \\item The \\key{intersection} $A \\cap B$ means\n    ''$A$ and $B$ happen''.\n    For example, the intersection of\n    $A=\\{2,5\\}$ and $B=\\{4,5,6\\}$ is\n    $A \\cap B = \\{5\\}$.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    \\subsubsection{Complement}\n\n    The probability of the complement\n    $\\bar A$ is calculated using the formula\n    \\[P(\\bar A)=1-P(A).\\]\n\n    Sometimes, we can solve a problem easily\n    using complements by solving the opposite problem.\n    For example, the probability of getting\n    at least one six when throwing a dice ten times is\n    \\[1-(5/6)^{10}.\\]\n\n    Here $5/6$ is the probability that the outcome\n    of a single throw is not six, and\n    $(5/6)^{10}$ is the probability that none of\n    the ten throws is a six.\n    The complement of this is the answer to the problem.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Union}\n\n    The probability of the union $A \\cup B$\n    is calculated using the formula\n    \\[P(A \\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \\cap B).\\]\n    For example, when throwing a dice,\n    the union of the events\n    \\[A=\\textrm{''the outcome is even''}\\]\n    and\n    \\[B=\\textrm{''the outcome is less than 4''}\\]\n    is\n    \\[A \\cup B=\\textrm{''the outcome is even or less than 4''},\\]\n    and its probability is\n    \\[P(A \\cup B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A \\cap B)=1/2+1/2-1/6=5/6.\\]\n\n    If the events $A$ and $B$ are \\key{disjoint}, i.e.,\n    $A \\cap B$ is empty,\n    the probability of the event $A \\cup B$ is simply\n\n    \\[P(A \\cup B)=P(A)+P(B).\\]\n\n    \\subsubsection{Conditional probability}\n\n    \\index{conditional probability}\n\n    The \\key{conditional probability}\n    \\[P(A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\\]\n    is the probability of $A$\n    assuming that $B$ happens.\n    Hence, when calculating the\n    probability of $A$, we only consider the outcomes\n    that also belong to $B$.\n\n    Using the previous sets,\n    \\[P(A | B)= 1/3,\\]\n    because the outcomes of $B$ are\n    $\\{1,2,3\\}$, and one of them is even.\n    This is the probability of an even outcome\n    if we know that the outcome is between $1 \\ldots 3$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Intersection}\n\n    \\index{independence}\n\n    Using conditional probability,\n    the probability of the intersection\n    $A \\cap B$ can be calculated using the formula\n    \\[P(A \\cap B)=P(A)P(B|A).\\]\n    Events $A$ and $B$ are \\key{independent} if\n    \\[P(A|B)=P(A) \\hspace{10px}\\textrm{and}\\hspace{10px} P(B|A)=P(B),\\]\n    which means that the fact that $B$ happens does not\n    change the probability of $A$, and vice versa.\n    In this case, the probability of the intersection is\n    \\[P(A \\cap B)=P(A)P(B).\\]\n    For example, when drawing a card from a deck, the events\n    \\[A = \\textrm{''the suit is clubs''}\\]\n    and\n    \\[B = \\textrm{''the value is four''}\\]\n    are independent. Hence the event\n    \\[A \\cap B = \\textrm{''the card is the four of clubs''}\\]\n    happens with probability\n    \\[P(A \\cap B)=P(A)P(B)=1/4 \\cdot 1/13 = 1/52.\\]\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify potential issues that could lead to test failures.\n\n1. **Input Handling:**\n   - The input is read as a single block and split into test cases. Each test case is separated by a blank line. The code uses `strip().split('\\n\\n')` to separate test cases, which seems correct. However, we need to ensure that we handle the input correctly, especially the first line which indicates the number of test cases.\n\n2. **Node Representation:**\n   - Each node is represented as a list where the first element indicates the type (0 for input, 1 for OR, 2 for AND) and the subsequent elements are the indices of the input nodes. This representation seems correct.\n\n3. **Probability Calculation:**\n   - The function `calculate_output_probability` computes the probability of the output node being 1 based on the type of each node. The logic for OR and AND gates appears to be correct:\n     - For an OR gate, the output is 1 if at least one input is 1.\n     - For an AND gate, the output is 1 only if both inputs are 1.\n   - However, we need to ensure that the indices used to access the `probabilities` list are correct (0-based indexing).\n\n4. **Binary Search Logic:**\n   - The binary search is set up to find the value of \\( p \\) such that the output probability is 1/2. The condition for adjusting `low` and `high` seems correct, but we need to ensure that the precision (`epsilon`) is appropriate for convergence.\n\n5. **Output Formatting:**\n   - The output is formatted to 5 decimal places, which is correct. However, we need to ensure that we are printing the result after the binary search completes.\n\n6. **Potential Issues:**\n   - The main issue could be related to how the probabilities are calculated or how the binary search converges. If the probabilities are not calculated correctly, the binary search may not find the correct value of \\( p \\).\n   - Additionally, if the input format is not handled correctly, it could lead to runtime errors.\n\n### Steps to Fix the Code:\n1. Ensure that the input is read correctly and that the number of test cases is handled properly.\n2. Verify that the indices used in the `calculate_output_probability` function are correct and that the probabilities are calculated accurately.\n3. Check the binary search logic to ensure it converges correctly to the desired probability.\n4. Make sure to print the output after processing all test cases.\n\nNow, let's implement these fixes in the code. \n\n```python\ndef calculate_output_probability(nodes, p):\n    # Calculate the probability of the output node being 1\n    probabilities = [0] * len(nodes)\n    \n    for i in range(len(nodes)):\n        if nodes[i][0] == 0:  # Input node\n            probabilities[i] = p\n        elif nodes[i][0] == 1:  # OR gate\n            a, b = nodes[i][1] - 1, nodes[i][2] - 1\n            probabilities[i] = 1 - (1 - probabilities[a]) * (1 - probabilities[b])\n        elif nodes[i][0] == 2:  # AND gate\n            a, b = nodes[i][1] - 1, nodes[i][2] - 1\n            probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]\n    \n    return probabilities[-1]  # Return the probability of the last node\n\ndef find_probability(test_cases):\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        n = int(test_case[0])  # Number of nodes\n        nodes = []\n        \n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            line = list(map(int, test_case[i].split()))\n            nodes.append(line)\n        \n        # Binary search for p\n        low = 0.0\n        high = 1.0\n        epsilon = 1e-7  # Precision for binary search\n        \n        while (high - low) > epsilon:\n            mid = (low + high) / 2\n            output_probability = calculate_output_probability(nodes, mid)\n            if output_probability < 0.5:\n                low = mid\n            else:\n                high = mid\n        \n        # Print the result formatted to 5 decimal places\n        print(f\"{(low + high) / 2:.5f}\")\n\n# Read input and call the function\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().strip().split('\\n\\n')\ntest_cases = [case.splitlines() for case in data if case.strip()]  # Ensure no empty cases\nfind_probability(test_cases)\n``` \n\nThis revised code ensures that we handle the input correctly, calculate probabilities accurately, and print the results as expected."

Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve. The challenge involved efficiently updating scores for potentially large numbers of students and questions.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate an array based on given ranges and perform arithmetic operations efficiently. The solution involved initializing an array of scores, iterating through the questions, and updating the scores for the specified range of students. After processing all questions, the mean score was calculated by summing the scores and dividing by the number of students.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that the mean score was printed as an integer. The code was structured to read input in bulk for efficiency, especially given the constraints of up to 100,000 students and questions. \n\n    Key takeaways include the importance of efficient array manipulation and the need to consider performance when dealing with large datasets. The solution was straightforward and did not encounter unexpected errors, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem requirements. \n\n    Here is the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, M = case[0]  # Number of students and questions\n            scores = [10] * N  # Initialize scores for all students to 10\n        \n            for question in case[1]:  # Process each question\n                i, j, k = question  # Get the range and complexity\n                for student in range(i - 1, j):  # Update scores for students in range\n                    scores[student] *= k\n        \n            mean_score = sum(scores) // N  # Calculate the mean score\n            print(mean_score)  # Output the mean score\n\n    # Read input\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n\n    T = int(data[0])  # Number of test cases\n    test_cases = []\n    index = 1\n\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, M = map(int, data[index].split())\n        questions = []\n        for j in range(M):\n            i, j, k = map(int, data[index + 1 + j].split())\n            questions.append((i, j, k))\n        test_cases.append(((N, M), questions))\n        index += M + 1\n\n    # Call the function with the parsed input\n    calculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to generate a specific pattern of numbers based on an integer input K for multiple test cases. The expected output required printing K lines for each test case, where each line consisted of alternating 1s and 0s, starting with 1.\n\n    Initially, I misunderstood the pattern requirements and implemented a countdown pattern instead of the alternating sequence. This led to incorrect outputs that did not match the expected format. The key realization was that each line should consist of K characters, alternating between 1 and 0, with the first character determined by the line index.\n\n    The final solution correctly implemented the logic to generate the required pattern. The code iterated through each test case, generated the appropriate lines based on the input K, and ensured proper formatting between test cases. The successful code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def generate_pattern(T):\n        for t in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case\n            K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case\n            for i in range(K):  # For each line from 0 to K-1\n                line = \"\"  # Initialize an empty line\n                for j in range(K):  # Create a line of length K\n                    if j % 2 == 0:  # If the index is even\n                        line += \"1\"  # Append '1'\n                    else:  # If the index is odd\n                        line += \"0\"  # Append '0'\n                print(line)  # Print the generated line\n            if t < T - 1:  # If this is not the last test case, print a blank line\n                print()  # Print a blank line to separate test cases\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    generate_pattern(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the problem requirements and ensuring that the output format aligns with expectations.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify potential issues that could lead to test failures.\n\n1. **Input Handling:**\n   - The input is read as a single block and split into test cases. Each test case is separated by a blank line. The code uses `strip().split('\\n\\n')` to separate test cases, which seems correct. However, we need to ensure that we handle the input correctly, especially the first line which indicates the number of test cases.\n\n2. **Node Representation:**\n   - Each node is represented as a list where the first element indicates the type (0 for input, 1 for OR, 2 for AND) and the subsequent elements are the indices of the input nodes. This representation seems correct.\n\n3. **Probability Calculation:**\n   - The function `calculate_output_probability` computes the probability of the output node being 1 based on the type of each node. The logic for OR and AND gates appears to be correct:\n     - For an OR gate, the output is 1 if at least one input is 1.\n     - For an AND gate, the output is 1 only if both inputs are 1.\n   - However, we need to ensure that the indices used to access the `probabilities` list are correct (0-based indexing).\n\n4. **Binary Search Logic:**\n   - The binary search is set up to find the value of \\( p \\) such that the output probability is 1/2. The condition for adjusting `low` and `high` seems correct, but we need to ensure that the precision (`epsilon`) is appropriate for convergence.\n\n5. **Output Formatting:**\n   - The output is formatted to 5 decimal places, which is correct. However, we need to ensure that we are printing the result after the binary search completes.\n\n6. **Potential Issues:**\n   - The main issue could be related to how the probabilities are calculated or how the binary search converges. If the probabilities are not calculated correctly, the binary search may not find the correct value of \\( p \\).\n   - Additionally, if the input format is not handled correctly, it could lead to runtime errors.\n\n### Steps to Fix the Code:\n1. Ensure that the input is read correctly and that the number of test cases is handled properly.\n2. Verify that the indices used in the `calculate_output_probability` function are correct and that the probabilities are calculated accurately.\n3. Check the binary search logic to ensure it converges correctly to the desired probability.\n4. Make sure to print the output after processing all test cases.\n\nNow, let's implement these fixes in the code. \n\n```python\ndef calculate_output_probability(nodes, p):\n    # Calculate the probability of the output node being 1\n    probabilities = [0] * len(nodes)\n    \n    for i in range(len(nodes)):\n        if nodes[i][0] == 0:  # Input node\n            probabilities[i] = p\n        elif nodes[i][0] == 1:  # OR gate\n            a, b = nodes[i][1] - 1, nodes[i][2] - 1\n            probabilities[i] = 1 - (1 - probabilities[a]) * (1 - probabilities[b])\n        elif nodes[i][0] == 2:  # AND gate\n            a, b = nodes[i][1] - 1, nodes[i][2] - 1\n            probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]\n    \n    return probabilities[-1]  # Return the probability of the last node\n\ndef find_probability(test_cases):\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        n = int(test_case[0])  # Number of nodes\n        nodes = []\n        \n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            line = list(map(int, test_case[i].split()))\n            nodes.append(line)\n        \n        # Binary search for p\n        low = 0.0\n        high = 1.0\n        epsilon = 1e-7  # Precision for binary search\n        \n        while (high - low) > epsilon:\n            mid = (low + high) / 2\n            output_probability = calculate_output_probability(nodes, mid)\n            if output_probability < 0.5:\n                low = mid\n            else:\n                high = mid\n        \n        # Print the result formatted to 5 decimal places\n        print(f\"{(low + high) / 2:.5f}\")\n\n# Read input and call the function\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().strip().split('\\n\\n')\ntest_cases = [case.splitlines() for case in data if case.strip()]  # Ensure no empty cases\nfind_probability(test_cases)\n``` \n\nThis revised code ensures that we handle the input correctly, calculate probabilities accurately, and print the results as expected."

Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve. The challenge involved efficiently updating scores for potentially large numbers of students and questions.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate an array based on given ranges and perform arithmetic operations efficiently. The solution involved initializing an array of scores, iterating through the questions, and updating the scores for the specified range of students. After processing all questions, the mean score was calculated by summing the scores and dividing by the number of students.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that the mean score was printed as an integer. The code was structured to read input in bulk for efficiency, especially given the constraints of up to 100,000 students and questions. \n\n    Key takeaways include the importance of efficient array manipulation and the need to consider performance when dealing with large datasets. The solution was straightforward and did not encounter unexpected errors, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem requirements. \n\n    Here is the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, M = case[0]  # Number of students and questions\n            scores = [10] * N  # Initialize scores for all students to 10\n        \n            for question in case[1]:  # Process each question\n                i, j, k = question  # Get the range and complexity\n                for student in range(i - 1, j):  # Update scores for students in range\n                    scores[student] *= k\n        \n            mean_score = sum(scores) // N  # Calculate the mean score\n            print(mean_score)  # Output the mean score\n\n    # Read input\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n\n    T = int(data[0])  # Number of test cases\n    test_cases = []\n    index = 1\n\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, M = map(int, data[index].split())\n        questions = []\n        for j in range(M):\n            i, j, k = map(int, data[index + 1 + j].split())\n            questions.append((i, j, k))\n        test_cases.append(((N, M), questions))\n        index += M + 1\n\n    # Call the function with the parsed input\n    calculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to generate a specific pattern of numbers based on an integer input K for multiple test cases. The expected output required printing K lines for each test case, where each line consisted of alternating 1s and 0s, starting with 1.\n\n    Initially, I misunderstood the pattern requirements and implemented a countdown pattern instead of the alternating sequence. This led to incorrect outputs that did not match the expected format. The key realization was that each line should consist of K characters, alternating between 1 and 0, with the first character determined by the line index.\n\n    The final solution correctly implemented the logic to generate the required pattern. The code iterated through each test case, generated the appropriate lines based on the input K, and ensured proper formatting between test cases. The successful code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def generate_pattern(T):\n        for t in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case\n            K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case\n            for i in range(K):  # For each line from 0 to K-1\n                line = \"\"  # Initialize an empty line\n                for j in range(K):  # Create a line of length K\n                    if j % 2 == 0:  # If the index is even\n                        line += \"1\"  # Append '1'\n                    else:  # If the index is odd\n                        line += \"0\"  # Append '0'\n                print(line)  # Print the generated line\n            if t < T - 1:  # If this is not the last test case, print a blank line\n                print()  # Print a blank line to separate test cases\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    generate_pattern(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the problem requirements and ensuring that the output format aligns with expectations.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This object-oriented approach simplifies the management of nodes and their relationships.\n   - The recursive function `finder` effectively computes the output probability by traversing the nodes. It handles both input nodes and gates (OR and AND) in a clean manner, returning the computed probability based on the type of node.\n\n2. **Binary Search Implementation:**\n   - The official solution employs a binary search to find the probability \\( p \\) that results in the output being 1 with a probability of exactly 1/2.

This ensures that the search converges accurately to the desired probability.\n\n3. **Input Handling:**\n   - The official solution reads input in a structured way, initializing the node list and populating it based on the input format. This systematic approach helps avoid potential issues with input parsing that I encountered.\n\n4. **Efficiency and Clarity:**\n   - The official solution is more efficient in terms of space and time complexity due to its use of recursion and direct node manipulation. My approach, while functional, was less clear and potentially more error-prone due to the way probabilities were calculated and stored.\n\n5. **Output Formatting:**\n   - The official solution formats the output directly using string formatting, ensuring that the result is displayed with five decimal places, which aligns with the problem requirements.\n\nIn summary, the official solution's use of a class for node representation, a recursive approach for probability calculation, and a more precise binary search contributed to its effectiveness. My initial attempts lacked these structured elements, leading to issues in handling the problem correctly. This experience highlights the importance of clear data structures and efficient algorithms in solving complex problems."
