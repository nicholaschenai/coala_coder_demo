    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to find the length of the longest subsequence in a given list of integers where the numbers in the subsequence are in strictly increasing order. The input list can be unsorted, and we only need to return the length of this subsequence, not the subsequence itself.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We will create an array `d` where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. We will iterate through the input list and for each element, check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. The maximum value in the `d` array at the end will give us the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function lengthOfLIS(nums):\n       n = length of nums\n       if n is 0:\n           return 0\n       \n       create an array d of size n and initialize all elements to 1\n       \n       for i from 1 to n-1:\n           for j from 0 to i-1:\n               if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                   d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n       \n       return max value in d\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Get the length of the input list\n        n = len(nums)\n        \n        # If the list is empty, return 0\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Create an array d to store the length of the longest increasing subsequence\n        d = [1] * n\n        \n        # Iterate through the list to fill the d array\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            for j in range(i):\n                # If the current number is greater than the previous number\n                if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                    # Update the d array with the maximum length found\n                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n        # The length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in d\n        return max(d)\n```",
