    "summary": "### Summary of Attempts\n\nThe problem involved transforming a sequence of segments defined by pairs of integers using a series of operations (L+, R+, L-, R-). The goal was to achieve the transformation with the minimum number of operations while ensuring the operations were in lexicographically minimal order.\n\n#### Key Concepts:\n1. **Operations**: The operations allowed were shifting the left or right borders of the segments. The challenge was to determine the correct sequence of operations based on the differences between consecutive segments.\n2. **Lexicographical Order**: When generating operations, it was crucial to prioritize L+ over L- and R+ over R- to maintain the lexicographical order.\n\n#### Strategies and Issues:\n- The initial attempts failed to correctly concatenate operations when both left and right shifts were needed. The operations were generated separately, leading to incorrect sequences.\n- The total number of operations was calculated correctly, but the output format did not match the expected results due to the incorrect order of operations.\n\n#### Final Code:\nThe final solution correctly handled the transformation logic and ensured the operations were generated in the correct order. However, it still failed to pass all tests due to issues with operation concatenation and output formatting.\n\n```python\ndef transform_segments(T):\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        segments = []\n        for i in range(N):\n            L, R = map(int, input().split())\n            segments.append((L, R))\n        \n        operations = \"\"\n        total_operations = 0\n        \n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            L1, R1 = segments[i]\n            L2, R2 = segments[i + 1]\n            \n            # Calculate shifts needed\n            left_shift = L2 - L1\n            right_shift = R2 - R1\n            \n            # Handle left shifts\n            if left_shift > 0:\n                operations += \"L+\" * left_shift\n            elif left_shift < 0:\n                operations += \"L-\" * (-left_shift)\n            \n            # Handle right shifts\n            if right_shift > 0:\n                operations += \"R+\" * right_shift\n            elif right_shift < 0:\n                operations += \"R-\" * (-right_shift)\n            \n            # Update total operations\n            total_operations += abs(left_shift) + abs(right_shift)\n        \n        print(total_operations)\n        print(operations)\n\n# Read number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ntransform_segments(T)\n```\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing operation sequences and ensuring that the output format aligns with the problem requirements. Future attempts should focus on validating the output against expected results more rigorously.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\nIn my attempts to solve the problem, I focused on generating the sequence of operations to transform segments while ensuring the operations were in lexicographically minimal order. However, my approach failed to correctly prioritize the operations, leading to incorrect outputs for certain test cases. \n\nThe official solution effectively breaks down the transformation process into a loop that continues until the current segment matches the target segment. It prioritizes operations in a specific order: first attempting to decrease the left border (L-), then increasing it (L+), followed by increasing the right border (R+), and finally decreasing it (R-). This order ensures that the lexicographical requirements are met while also minimizing the number of operations.\n\nKey insights from the official solution include:\n1. **Prioritization of Operations**: The solution explicitly prioritizes L- and L+ before R+ and R-, which is crucial for maintaining the lexicographical order.\n2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The use of a while loop allows for continuous adjustment of the segment borders until they match the target, ensuring that all necessary operations are accounted for.\n3. **Efficiency**: The approach is efficient as it directly modifies the segment borders and appends the corresponding operations to a list, which is then printed in one go.\n\nIn contrast, my previous attempts did not adequately handle the prioritization of operations and failed to account for the conditions under which certain operations should be applied. This led to incorrect sequences and outputs. The official solution's structured approach provides a clearer and more effective method for solving the problem.",
