He wants to transform the first segment to the last one (with index N). His plan is to do this big deal with a number of transformations: firstly he will transform\n\nthe first segment to the second one, then to the third one, then to the fourth one, and so on till N-th one.\n\nChef can use operation of a single type: shift one segment border by one unit. So, if he has segment [L, R], he can transform it into one of the following segments: [L + 1, R] (we will denote such operation with string L+), [L, R + 1] (will be denoted as R+), [L - 1, R] (L-), [L, R - 1] (R-). Chef doesn't like empty segments, therefore he cannot use any operation that makes a segment empty (L = R).\n\nChef really wants to transform his segment as fast as possible. Please, help him. Find the sequence with minimal number of operations that transforms his segment. If there are multiple such sequences pick the lexicographically minimal one.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. \n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of segments Chef has. \n\nThe following N lines contain pairs of integers. The i-th line contains integers Li, Ri, denoting i-th Chef's segment.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case print an answer - two lines. The first line should contain the minimal number of operations. The second line should contain the sequence of operations\n\nwithout any whitespaces.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T, N \u2264 1000.\n- -1000 \u2264 Li < Ri \u2264 1000.\nThe total sum of N values for all test cases doesn't exceed 1000.\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n4\n3\n-1 0\n0 1\n3 5\n1\n0 1\n3\n-2 -1\n-2 -1\n-2 0\n4\n4 6\n3 5\n-1 1\n1 2\n\nOutput:\n9\nR+L+R+L+R+L+R+L+R+\n0\n\n1\nR+\n13\nL-R-L-L-L-L-R-R-R-R-L+R+L+\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The problem involved checking if Chef's position was on any wall and counting how many walls were above his maximum coordinate.\n\n    The core concept involved understanding the geometric representation of walls as line segments and how to efficiently determine the number of walls Chef would need to break through. The solution utilized a straightforward approach of iterating through wall positions and comparing them to Chef's coordinates.\n\n    The implemented solution successfully handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that if Chef's position was on a wall, it returned -1. Otherwise, it counted the walls that were above the maximum of Chef's x and y coordinates. The code was structured to read multiple test cases and queries efficiently.\n\n    Key takeaways include the importance of checking conditions before performing calculations and the efficiency of using simple comparisons to solve geometric problems. The solution was effective, and no unexpected errors occurred during implementation. The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def process_test_cases(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            walls = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            Q = int(input())\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                x_j, y_j = map(int, input().split())\n            \n                if x_j == y_j and x_j in walls:\n                    print(-1)\n                    continue\n            \n                count = 0\n                max_coord = max(x_j, y_j)\n            \n                for wall in walls:\n                    if wall > max_coord:\n                        count += 1\n            \n                print(count)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    process_test_cases(T)\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process and the final solution, which can be referenced for similar geometric problems in the future.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find a contiguous segment of railway stations such that the sum of their expected profits or losses is as close to zero as possible. The challenge involved efficiently tracking cumulative sums and identifying segments that yield the minimum absolute sum.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    1. **Cumulative Sum:** The use of a cumulative sum allows for efficient calculation of the sum of any segment of the array by leveraging previously computed sums.\n    2. **Hash Map for Indices:** Storing the first occurrence of each cumulative sum in a dictionary enables quick lookups to determine the length of segments that yield a specific cumulative sum.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - The initial approach involved checking if the cumulative sum was zero or if it had been seen before. However, the logic for updating the best segment was flawed, leading to incorrect outputs.\n    - The need to track both the minimum absolute sum and the longest segment with that sum was crucial but not implemented correctly in the initial attempts.\n\n    ### Errors and Fixes:\n    - The main error was in how the cumulative sums were compared and how the best segment was updated. The logic needed to ensure that when a cumulative sum was found, it correctly checked for both the absolute value and the length of the segment.\n    - The initialization of the cumulative sum index with zero at index -1 was necessary to handle cases where the cumulative sum itself was zero.\n\n    ### Final Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def find_closest_segment(N, profits):\n        cumulative_sum_index = {}\n        cumulative_sum = 0\n        min_abs_sum = float('inf')\n        best_start = -1\n        best_end = -1\n        max_length = 0\n\n        cumulative_sum_index[0] = -1\n\n        for i in range(N):\n            cumulative_sum += profits[i]\n\n            if cumulative_sum in cumulative_sum_index:\n                start_index = cumulative_sum_index[cumulative_sum]\n                length = i - start_index\n                if abs(cumulative_sum) < min_abs_sum or (abs(cumulative_sum) == min_abs_sum and length > max_length):\n                    min_abs_sum = abs(cumulative_sum)\n                    best_start = start_index + 1\n                    best_end = i\n                    max_length = length\n            else:\n                cumulative_sum_index[cumulative_sum] = i\n\n            if abs(cumulative_sum) < min_abs_sum:\n                min_abs_sum = abs(cumulative_sum)\n                best_start = 0\n                best_end = i\n                max_length = i + 1\n\n        return min_abs_sum, best_start + 1, best_end + 1\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of careful index management and the need to thoroughly test edge cases when dealing with cumulative sums and segments.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The solution involved iterating through each character, removing it, and then trying to insert it back into every possible position in the remaining string. This brute-force approach ensured that all configurations were considered.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the manipulation of strings and understanding of lexicographical order. The solution effectively utilized nested loops: the outer loop for character removal and the inner loop for reinsertion, which allowed for comprehensive exploration of possible outcomes.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases. The key takeaway was the importance of systematically exploring all possible configurations when dealing with string manipulations, especially in problems involving order and arrangement. The solution was efficient given the constraints, as the maximum string length was 50, making the brute-force approach feasible. \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):\n        smallest_string = S  \n        for i in range(len(S)):\n            char_to_move = S[i]  \n            remaining_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]  \n            for j in range(len(remaining_string) + 1):\n                new_string = remaining_string[:j] + char_to_move + remaining_string[j:]  \n                if new_string < smallest_string:\n                    smallest_string = new_string  \n        return smallest_string\n\n    def main():\n        T = int(input())  \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())  \n            S = input().strip()  \n            result = find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S)  \n            print(result)  \n\n    main()\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element `A[i]` by its index `i` any number of times. The key concepts involved were understanding the operations allowed and calculating the total sum of the sequence and the maximum possible reduction.\n\n    Initially, the logic incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it would always be possible to make the sequence good. This led to incorrect outputs, especially when the total sum was negative. The correct approach involved checking if the total sum was negative (in which case it was impossible to make it zero) and ensuring that if the total sum was positive, it could be reduced to zero using the maximum reduction available.\n\n    The final solution correctly implemented these checks:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            A = case[1]\n            total_sum = sum(A)\n            max_reduction = sum(i for i in range(1, N + 1))\n        \n            if total_sum < 0:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            elif total_sum <= max_reduction:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering edge cases and the implications of the operations allowed on the sequence.

The correct approach involved checking if the total sum was negative (in which case it was impossible to make it zero) and ensuring that if the total sum was positive, it could be reduced to zero using the maximum reduction available.\n\n    The final solution correctly implemented these checks:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            A = case[1]\n            total_sum = sum(A)\n            max_reduction = sum(i for i in range(1, N + 1))\n        \n            if total_sum < 0:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            elif total_sum <= max_reduction:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering edge cases and the implications of the operations allowed on the sequence. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming the correctness of the logic.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to compute the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to a given number \"N\" for multiple test cases. The solution involved recognizing that the multiples of 10 form an arithmetic series, which allowed for an efficient calculation using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\n\n    Key concepts included:\n    - Understanding how to derive the last term of the series as the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to \"N\".\n    - Using integer division to determine the number of terms in the series.\n    - Applying the arithmetic series sum formula to compute the total efficiently.\n\n    The implemented solution successfully handled the input and output requirements, iterating through each test case and calculating the required sum. The code snippet used was:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_sum_of_multiples_of_10(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            last_term = (N // 10) * 10\n            number_of_terms = N // 10\n        \n            if number_of_terms > 0:\n                total_sum = (number_of_terms * (10 + last_term)) // 2\n            else:\n                total_sum = 0\n        \n            print(total_sum)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    calculate_sum_of_multiples_of_10(T)\n    ```\n\n    The solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating a clear understanding of arithmetic series and effective use of basic arithmetic operations. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The goal was to achieve the transformation with the minimum number of operations while ensuring the operations were in lexicographically minimal order.\n\n#### Key Concepts:\n1. **Operations**: The operations allowed were shifting the left or right borders of the segments. The challenge was to determine the correct sequence of operations based on the differences between consecutive segments.\n2. **Lexicographical Order**: When generating operations, it was crucial to prioritize L+ over L- and R+ over R- to maintain the lexicographical order.\n\n#### Strategies and Issues:\n- The initial attempts failed to correctly concatenate operations when both left and right shifts were needed. The operations were generated separately, leading to incorrect sequences.\n- The total number of operations was calculated correctly, but the output format did not match the expected results due to the incorrect order of operations.\n\n#### Final Code:\nThe final solution correctly handled the transformation logic and ensured the operations were generated in the correct order. However, it still failed to pass all tests due to issues with operation concatenation and output formatting.\n\n```python\ndef transform_segments(T):\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        segments = []\n        for i in range(N):\n            L, R = map(int, input().split())\n            segments.append((L, R))\n        \n        operations = \"\"\n        total_operations = 0\n        \n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            L1, R1 = segments[i]\n            L2, R2 = segments[i + 1]\n            \n            # Calculate shifts needed\n            left_shift = L2 - L1\n            right_shift = R2 - R1\n            \n            # Handle left shifts\n            if left_shift > 0:\n                operations += \"L+\" * left_shift\n            elif left_shift < 0:\n                operations += \"L-\" * (-left_shift)\n            \n            # Handle right shifts\n            if right_shift > 0:\n                operations += \"R+\" * right_shift\n            elif right_shift < 0:\n                operations += \"R-\" * (-right_shift)\n            \n            # Update total operations\n            total_operations += abs(left_shift) + abs(right_shift)\n        \n        print(total_operations)\n        print(operations)\n\n# Read number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ntransform_segments(T)\n```\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing operation sequences and ensuring that the output format aligns with the problem requirements.

However, my approach failed to correctly prioritize the operations, leading to incorrect outputs for certain test cases. \n\nThe official solution effectively breaks down the transformation process into a loop that continues until the current segment matches the target segment. It prioritizes operations in a specific order: first attempting to decrease the left border (L-), then increasing it (L+), followed by increasing the right border (R+), and finally decreasing it (R-). This order ensures that the lexicographical requirements are met while also minimizing the number of operations.\n\nKey insights from the official solution include:\n1. **Prioritization of Operations**: The solution explicitly prioritizes L- and L+ before R+ and R-, which is crucial for maintaining the lexicographical order.\n2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The use of a while loop allows for continuous adjustment of the segment borders until they match the target, ensuring that all necessary operations are accounted for.\n3. **Efficiency**: The approach is efficient as it directly modifies the segment borders and appends the corresponding operations to a list, which is then printed in one go.\n\nIn contrast, my previous attempts did not adequately handle the prioritization of operations and failed to account for the conditions under which certain operations should be applied. This led to incorrect sequences and outputs. The official solution's structured approach provides a clearer and more effective method for solving the problem."
