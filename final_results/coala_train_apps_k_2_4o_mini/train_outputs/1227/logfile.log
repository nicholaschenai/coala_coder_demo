INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem requires us to determine if there are three adjacent sides of a cube that are painted the same color. Each test case provides the colors of the six sides of the cube, and we need to check for each test case if such a triplet of adjacent sides exists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to identify the sets of three sides that are adjacent to each other on a cube. The pairs of adjacent sides can be grouped as follows:
   - Front, Left, Top
   - Front, Right, Top
   - Back, Left, Top
   - Back, Right, Top
   - Front, Left, Bottom
   - Front, Right, Bottom
   - Back, Left, Bottom
   - Back, Right, Bottom

   For each test case, we will check if any of these groups of three sides have the same color. If we find at least one such group, we will output "YES"; otherwise, we will output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function check_adjacent_colors(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read colors for front, back, left, right, top, bottom
           check the following combinations:
               if (front == left == top) or
                  (front == right == top) or
                  (back == left == top) or
                  (back == right == top) or
                  (front == left == bottom) or
                  (front == right == bottom) or
                  (back == left == bottom) or
                  (back == right == bottom):
                   output "YES"
               else:
                   output "NO"
   ```

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts

    The problem involved coloring intervals on the X-axis to maximize the length of the green area, which occurs when blue and yellow intervals overlap. The main challenge was to ensure that overlapping intervals were colored differently to create green areas.

    **Key Concepts:**
    - **Overlap Detection:** The solution required checking for overlaps between intervals to determine how to color them.
    - **Color Alternation:** When overlaps were detected, the intervals needed to be colored alternately to maximize the green area.

    **Initial Strategies:**
    - The initial approach involved sorting the intervals and checking for overlaps with only the last colored interval. This led to incorrect results, as it did not account for multiple overlapping intervals effectively.

    **Errors and Fixes:**
    - The main error was in the overlap handling logic, which did not properly alternate colors for all overlapping intervals. The output for the test case `['1', '3', '3 7', '2 5', '6 9']` was expected to be `100`, but the implementation returned `101`.
    - The solution needed to maintain a list of active intervals and check against all of them for overlaps, ensuring that colors were assigned correctly.

    **Final Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
        results = []
    
        for intervals in test_cases:
            n = intervals[0]
            interval_list = intervals[1]
        
            indexed_intervals = sorted((L, R, i) for i, (L, R) in enumerate(interval_list))
        
            result = ['0'] * n  # Initialize all intervals as blue (0)
        
            active_intervals = []
        
            for i in range(n):
                L, R, index = indexed_intervals[i]
                overlap_found = False
            
                for j in range(len(active_intervals)):
                    active_L, active_R, active_index = active_intervals[j]
                    if R > active_L:  # There is an overlap
                        overlap_found = True
                        if result[active_index] == '0':
                            result[index] = '1'  # Color current interval yellow
                        else:
                            result[index] = '0'  # Color current interval blue
                        break
            
                if not overlap_found:
                    result[index] = '0'
            
                active_intervals.append((L, R, index))
        
            results.append(''.join(result))
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)
    ```

[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which candidate Chef hires for the distribution task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly, while the second candidate places all apples in the box with the least apples. 

    The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) is equal to the number of apples (N), both candidates will end up with the same distribution (all apples in one box). However, if K is less than N, the distributions can differ, leading to a "NO" answer. The solution involved checking these conditions for each test case.

    The implemented solution was straightforward, iterating through the test cases and applying the logic to determine the output. The final code effectively handled the input and output requirements without any errors. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case
            if K == N:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        test_cases.append((N, K))

    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and how they influence the solution's logic.

INFO - [Task id] 1227 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem involves checking if it is possible to select three adjacent sides of a cube that are painted the same color. Each cube has six sides, and the colors of these sides are provided as input. We need to determine for multiple test cases whether such a selection is possible.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to identify the three pairs of adjacent sides on a cube. The pairs are:
   - Front, Left, Top
   - Front, Right, Top
   - Back, Left, Top
   - Back, Right, Top
   - Front, Left, Bottom
   - Front, Right, Bottom
   - Back, Left, Bottom
   - Back, Right, Bottom

   For each test case, we will check if any of these combinations of sides have the same color. If at least one combination matches, we will output "YES"; otherwise, we will output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function check_adjacent_colors(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read colors of the six sides

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine if three pairwise adjacent sides of a cube could be painted the same color based on given inputs. The problem required checking specific combinations of sides for color matches. 

The core concept involved understanding the geometry of a cube and identifying which sides are adjacent. The combinations to check included pairs like Front-Left-Top and Back-Right-Bottom, among others. The solution efficiently iterated through the test cases and checked these combinations using simple equality checks.

The implemented solution was straightforward and utilized basic list indexing to access the colors of the cube's sides. The function `check_adjacent_colors` processed the input and printed "YES" or "NO" based on whether any of the specified combinations had the same color. 

The final code snippet effectively handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that it could process up to 50,000 test cases efficiently. No unexpected errors occurred during the implementation, and the solution passed all provided test cases. 

Key code snippet:
```python
if (colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # Front, Left, Top
    colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[4] or  # Front, Right, Top
    ...
    colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[5]):   # Back, Right, Bottom
    results.append("YES")
else:
    results.append("NO")
``` 

This experience reinforced the importance of understanding spatial relationships in problems involving geometric shapes and the efficiency of direct comparisons in solving such problems.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for _ in range(int(input())):
 l=list(map(str,input().split()))

   c=1
   break
 if c==1:
  print("YES")
 else:
  print("NO")


INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] The official solution effectively checks for three adjacent sides of a cube that are painted the same color by using a more compact and efficient approach. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Input Handling**: The solution reads the number of test cases and the colors of the cube sides in a single line, which is efficient for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Adjacent Side Combinations**: Instead of explicitly checking each combination of sides, the official solution uses a predefined list of tuples that represent the indices of the adjacent sides. This reduces redundancy and makes the code cleaner.

3. **Set for Uniqueness**: The solution uses a set to check if all three selected sides have the same color. By converting the list of colors to a set, it can easily determine if all elements are identical (i.e., the length of the set is 1).

4. **Early Exit**: The use of a break statement allows the loop to exit as soon as a valid combination is found, which can save time in cases where a match is found early.

5. **Output**: The solution prints "YES" or "NO" based on whether a valid combination was found, which is straightforward and efficient.

Overall, the official solution is more concise and leverages Python's data structures effectively to achieve the desired outcome with minimal code. This experience highlights the importance of considering data structures and control flow for optimizing code, especially in competitive programming scenarios.

the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"scenarios": {"description": "In what scenarios will this knowledge be useful? Answer in a paragraph.", "title": "Scenarios", "type": "string"}, "keywords": {"description": "List of keywords that are useful for searching this problem/solution pair", "items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Keywords", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["scenarios", "keywords"]}

[Problem]
    One day, Chef found a cube which has each of its sides painted in some color out of black, blue, red, green, yellow and orange.
    Now he asks you to check if he can choose three sides such that they are pairwise adjacent and painted in the same color.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
    - A single line of each test case contains six words denoting the colors of painted sides in the order: front, back, left, right, top and bottom, respectively.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, output a single line containing the word "YES" or "NO" (without quotes) corresponding to the answer of the problem.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤  50000 
    - Each color will be from the list {"black", "blue", "red", "green", "yellow", "orange"}

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask 1: (25 points)
    - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤  12000 
    - For each test case there will be at most three different colors

    Subtask 2: (75 points)
    - Original constraints

    -----Example-----
    Input:
    2
    blue yellow green orange black green
    green yellow green orange black green

    Output:
    NO
    YES

    -----Explanation-----

    Example case 1.
    There are no three sides with the same color.

    Example case 2.
    In this test case, the front, bottom and left sides are green (see picture).

    def check_adjacent_colors(test_cases):
        results = []
    
        for colors in test_cases:
            # Check the combinations of adjacent sides
            if (colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # Front, Left, Top
                colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[4] or  # Front, Right, Top
                colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # Back, Left, Top
                colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[4] or  # Back, Right, Top
                colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # Front, Left, Bottom
                colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[5] or  # Front, Right, Bottom
                colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # Back, Left, Bottom
                colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[5]):   # Back, Right, Bottom
                results.append("YES")
            else:
                results.append("NO")
    
        # Print all results for each test case
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    # Read input
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        colors = input().split()
        test_cases.append(colors)

    # Call the function with the test cases
    check_adjacent_colors(test_cases)
