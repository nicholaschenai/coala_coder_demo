The main challenge was to ensure that overlapping intervals were colored differently to create green areas.\n\n    **Key Concepts:**\n    - **Overlap Detection:** The solution required checking for overlaps between intervals to determine how to color them.\n    - **Color Alternation:** When overlaps were detected, the intervals needed to be colored alternately to maximize the green area.\n\n    **Initial Strategies:**\n    - The initial approach involved sorting the intervals and checking for overlaps with only the last colored interval. This led to incorrect results, as it did not account for multiple overlapping intervals effectively.\n\n    **Errors and Fixes:**\n    - The main error was in the overlap handling logic, which did not properly alternate colors for all overlapping intervals. The output for the test case `['1', '3', '3 7', '2 5', '6 9']` was expected to be `100`, but the implementation returned `101`.\n    - The solution needed to maintain a list of active intervals and check against all of them for overlaps, ensuring that colors were assigned correctly.\n\n    **Final Code Snippet:**\n    ```python\n    def maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):\n        results = []\n    \n        for intervals in test_cases:\n            n = intervals[0]\n            interval_list = intervals[1]\n        \n            indexed_intervals = sorted((L, R, i) for i, (L, R) in enumerate(interval_list))\n        \n            result = ['0'] * n  # Initialize all intervals as blue (0)\n        \n            active_intervals = []\n        \n            for i in range(n):\n                L, R, index = indexed_intervals[i]\n                overlap_found = False\n            \n                for j in range(len(active_intervals)):\n                    active_L, active_R, active_index = active_intervals[j]\n                    if R > active_L:  # There is an overlap\n                        overlap_found = True\n                        if result[active_index] == '0':\n                            result[index] = '1'  # Color current interval yellow\n                        else:\n                            result[index] = '0'  # Color current interval blue\n                        break\n            \n                if not overlap_found:\n                    result[index] = '0'\n            \n                active_intervals.append((L, R, index))\n        \n            results.append(''.join(result))\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n    ```\n\n    This summary encapsulates the core concepts, strategies, and errors encountered during the problem-solving process, providing a reference for future similar problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which candidate Chef hires for the distribution task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly, while the second candidate places all apples in the box with the least apples. \n\n    The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) is equal to the number of apples (N), both candidates will end up with the same distribution (all apples in one box). However, if K is less than N, the distributions can differ, leading to a \"NO\" answer. The solution involved checking these conditions for each test case.\n\n    The implemented solution was straightforward, iterating through the test cases and applying the logic to determine the output. The final code effectively handled the input and output requirements without any errors. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            if K == N:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        test_cases.append((N, K))\n\n    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and how they influence the solution's logic.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
