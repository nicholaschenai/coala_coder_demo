Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:\n- N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.\n- Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.\n- The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).\nHe has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.\nYou are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where i\u2264j$i \\leq j$.\nFor eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:\nc\nco\ncod\ncode\ncodec\ncodeco\ncodecod\ncodecode\ncodecodec\ncodecodeco\n...\n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line contains string S$S$ \u2014 consisting of lowercase English letters.\n- The second line contains string T$T$ \u2014 consisting of lowercase English letters.\n- Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ \u2014 the number of queries.\n- Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions.

Each row `N` contains `N` characters, starting with the first character of `S` and continuing in a cyclic manner through `S` until the row is filled. We also have another string `T`, and we need to answer several queries about how many times `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve the problem, we need to determine the content of the `N`-th row of the pyramid. The row will consist of the first `N` characters of `S`, repeated cyclically. We can calculate the characters in the row using the modulo operation to wrap around the string `S`. Once we have the row, we can count how many times the string `T` appears in it. Given the constraints, we need to ensure our solution is efficient, especially since `N` can be very large (up to 10^9).\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n       length_S = length of S\n       length_T = length of T\n       results = []\n       \n       for each N in queries:\n           # Create the N-th row\n           row = \"\"\n           for i from 0 to N-1:\n               row += S[i % length_S]\n           \n           # Count occurrences of T in row\n           count = 0\n           for i from 0 to (N - length_T):\n               if row[i:i + length_T] == T:\n                   count += 1\n           \n           results.append(count)\n       \n       return results\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n    # Get the lengths of S and T\n    length_S = len(S)\n    length_T = len(T)\n    results = []\n    \n    # Process each query\n    for N in queries:\n        # Create the N-th row using cyclic pattern\n        row = \"\"\n        for i in range(N):\n            row += S[i % length_S]\n        \n        # Count occurrences of T in the row\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(N - length_T + 1):\n            if row[i:i + length_T] == T:\n                count += 1\n        \n        # Store the result for this query\n        results.append(count)\n    \n    return results\n\n# Read input\nS = input().strip()\nT = input().strip()\nQ = int(input().strip())\nqueries = [int(input().strip()) for _ in range(Q)]\n\n# Get the results\nresults = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)\n\n# Print the results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```"

The series is based on the sum of squares of the first (N-1) integers, which I failed to recognize at first.\n\n    The correct approach involves calculating the sum of squares up to (N-1). The formula for the N'th term can be derived as follows: T(N) = sum(i^2) for i from 0 to N-1. This realization led to the correct implementation of the function.\n\n    The final working code correctly computes the N'th term using a loop to sum the squares:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_series(N):\n        sum_of_squares = 0\n        for i in range(N):\n            sum_of_squares += i * i\n        return sum_of_squares\n\n    T = int(input())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        result = calculate_series(N)\n        print(result)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing the series and recognizing patterns, as well as the need to validate the derived formulas against sample outputs.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The key challenge was efficiently handling potentially large row numbers (up to 10^9) without actually constructing the entire row, as this would be computationally infeasible.\n\nThe solution involved creating a function to construct the N-th row by cyclically repeating `S` until the desired length was reached. I then counted the occurrences of `T` in this constructed row by checking every possible starting position for matches. This approach worked well for the provided test cases, and the implementation was straightforward.\n\nOne important aspect was ensuring that the substring search was done correctly, accounting for all possible starting indices. The solution passed all tests, indicating that the logic for counting occurrences was sound. \n\nOverall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding string manipulation and efficient counting techniques, especially when dealing with large inputs.

        "content": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach to solve the problem of counting occurrences of string `T` in the N-th row of the pyramid formed by string `S`. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **KMP Algorithm for Pattern Matching**: The solution uses the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm to efficiently find occurrences of the pattern `T` in the cyclically repeated string `S`. The KMP algorithm preprocesses the pattern to create a longest prefix-suffix (LPS) array, which allows for faster searching.\n\n2. **Cyclic Nature of the Pyramid**: Instead of constructing the N-th row explicitly, the solution recognizes that the row can be derived from the cyclic repetition of `S`. By doubling the string `S` (i.e., `S + S`), the solution can handle the wrap-around cases when searching for `T`.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Occurrences**: The solution uses a binary search to count how many times `T` can fit into the N-th row. It calculates how many complete cycles of `S` fit into the row and how many additional characters are needed from the next cycle.\n\n4. **Efficient Counting**: The count of occurrences is derived from:\n   - The number of complete cycles of `S` that fit into the row.\n   - The occurrences found in the first and second parts of the doubled string.\n   - The contribution from complete cycles of `S` that can fit into the row.\n\n5. **Handling Multiple Queries**: The solution efficiently handles multiple queries by precomputing the necessary information and using it to quickly answer each query.\n\nOverall, the official solution is significantly more efficient than the initial approach, especially given the constraints where `N` can be as large as \\(10^9\\). The use of KMP for substring searching and the clever handling of cyclic patterns allows it to avoid the need for constructing large strings directly, which would be infeasible for large values of `N`. \n\nThis experience highlights the importance of considering algorithmic efficiency and the potential for leveraging established algorithms like KMP in string processing tasks."

        "content": "\n[description for function: main]\nThis function reads input data consisting of two strings and a series of queries from standard input. It constructs a list of queries based on the input, where each query specifies a length for a cyclically repeated string. The function then counts the occurrences of a specified substring within the constructed string for each query. Finally, it prints the count of occurrences for each query on a new line. The overall purpose is to analyze how many times a substring appears in a cyclically generated string of a given length. The function effectively handles multiple queries in a single execution.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to analyze patterns in cyclic strings, particularly in competitive programming or algorithm design. It can be applied in problems involving substring search within generated sequences, especially when the sequences are infinite or very large. Understanding how to efficiently construct and search within these cyclic patterns can help optimize solutions for large input sizes and multiple queries, making it relevant in fields like text processing, data compression, and string matching algorithms."
