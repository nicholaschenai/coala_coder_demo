    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We have a string `S` that is used to create an infinite pyramid of rows, where the N-th row contains N characters formed by repeating the string `S` cyclically. We also have another string `T`, and we need to answer multiple queries about how many times `T` appears as a substring in the N-th row of the pyramid.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Determine the length of the N-th row, which is simply N.\n   - Construct the N-th row by taking the first N characters from the cyclic repetition of `S`.\n   - Count the occurrences of the string `T` in this row. This can be done by checking every possible starting position in the row and seeing if the substring matches `T`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n       for each query N:\n           row_length = N\n           row_string = construct_row(S, row_length)\n           count = 0\n           for i from 0 to row_length - len(T):\n               if row_string[i:i+len(T)] == T:\n                   count += 1\n           print count\n\n   function construct_row(S, length):\n       # Create the row by repeating S cyclically\n       row = \"\"\n       while len(row) < length:\n           row += S\n       return row[:length]\n\n   function main():\n       read S\n       read T\n       read Q\n       for each query:\n           read N\n           count_occurrences(S, T, N)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef construct_row(S, length):\n    # Create the row by repeating S cyclically until we reach the desired length\n    row = \"\"\n    while len(row) < length:\n        row += S\n    return row[:length]  # Return only the first 'length' characters\n\ndef count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n    results = []\n    for N in queries:\n        row_length = N\n        row_string = construct_row(S, row_length)  # Construct the N-th row\n        count = 0\n        # Count occurrences of T in the row_string\n        for i in range(row_length - len(T) + 1):\n            if row_string[i:i + len(T)] == T:\n                count += 1\n        results.append(count)  # Store the result for this query\n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    S = data[0]  # Read string S\n    T = data[1]  # Read string T\n    Q = int(data[2])  # Read number of queries\n    queries = [int(data[i]) for i in range(3, 3 + Q)]  # Read all queries\n    \n    results = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)  # Get results for all queries\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)  # Print each result on a new line\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n```",
