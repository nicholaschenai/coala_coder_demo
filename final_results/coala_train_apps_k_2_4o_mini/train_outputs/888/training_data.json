    "summary": "In this task, I was required to construct a pyramid of strings based on a given string `S` and answer multiple queries about the occurrences of another string `T` in specific rows of the pyramid. The key challenge was efficiently handling potentially large row numbers (up to 10^9) without actually constructing the entire row, as this would be computationally infeasible.\n\nThe solution involved creating a function to construct the N-th row by cyclically repeating `S` until the desired length was reached. I then counted the occurrences of `T` in this constructed row by checking every possible starting position for matches. This approach worked well for the provided test cases, and the implementation was straightforward.\n\nOne important aspect was ensuring that the substring search was done correctly, accounting for all possible starting indices. The solution passed all tests, indicating that the logic for counting occurrences was sound. \n\nOverall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding string manipulation and efficient counting techniques, especially when dealing with large inputs. The final code snippet effectively encapsulated the solution, demonstrating a clear structure with helper functions for row construction and counting occurrences.",
    "reflection": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach to solve the problem of counting occurrences of string `T` in the N-th row of the pyramid formed by string `S`. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **KMP Algorithm for Pattern Matching**: The solution uses the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm to efficiently find occurrences of the pattern `T` in the cyclically repeated string `S`. The KMP algorithm preprocesses the pattern to create a longest prefix-suffix (LPS) array, which allows for faster searching.\n\n2. **Cyclic Nature of the Pyramid**: Instead of constructing the N-th row explicitly, the solution recognizes that the row can be derived from the cyclic repetition of `S`. By doubling the string `S` (i.e., `S + S`), the solution can handle the wrap-around cases when searching for `T`.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Occurrences**: The solution uses a binary search to count how many times `T` can fit into the N-th row. It calculates how many complete cycles of `S` fit into the row and how many additional characters are needed from the next cycle.\n\n4. **Efficient Counting**: The count of occurrences is derived from:\n   - The number of complete cycles of `S` that fit into the row.\n   - The occurrences found in the first and second parts of the doubled string.\n   - The contribution from complete cycles of `S` that can fit into the row.\n\n5. **Handling Multiple Queries**: The solution efficiently handles multiple queries by precomputing the necessary information and using it to quickly answer each query.\n\nOverall, the official solution is significantly more efficient than the initial approach, especially given the constraints where `N` can be as large as \\(10^9\\). The use of KMP for substring searching and the clever handling of cyclic patterns allows it to avoid the need for constructing large strings directly, which would be infeasible for large values of `N`. \n\nThis experience highlights the importance of considering algorithmic efficiency and the potential for leveraging established algorithms like KMP in string processing tasks.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThis function reads input data consisting of two strings and a series of queries from standard input. It constructs a list of queries based on the input, where each query specifies a length for a cyclically repeated string. The function then counts the occurrences of a specified substring within the constructed string for each query. Finally, it prints the count of occurrences for each query on a new line. The overall purpose is to analyze how many times a substring appears in a cyclically generated string of a given length. The function effectively handles multiple queries in a single execution.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to analyze patterns in cyclic strings, particularly in competitive programming or algorithm design. It can be applied in problems involving substring search within generated sequences, especially when the sequences are infinite or very large. Understanding how to efficiently construct and search within these cyclic patterns can help optimize solutions for large input sizes and multiple queries, making it relevant in fields like text processing, data compression, and string matching algorithms."
