programming}\n\n    \\key{Dynamic programming}\n    is a technique that combines the correctness\n    of complete search and the efficiency\n    of greedy algorithms.\n    Dynamic programming can be applied if the\n    problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems\n    that can be solved independently.\n\n    There are two uses for dynamic programming:\n\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item\n    \\key{Finding an optimal solution}:\n    We want to find a solution that is\n    as large as possible or as small as possible.\n    \\item\n    \\key{Counting the number of solutions}:\n    We want to calculate the total number of\n    possible solutions.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    We will first see how dynamic programming can\n    be used to find an optimal solution,\n    and then we will use the same idea for\n    counting the solutions.\n\n    Understanding dynamic programming is a milestone\n    in every competitive programmer's career.\n    While the basic idea is simple,\n    the challenge is how to apply\n    dynamic programming to different problems.\n    This chapter introduces a set of classic problems\n    that are a good starting point.\n\n    \\section{Coin problem}\n\n    We first focus on a problem that we\n    have already seen in Chapter 6:\n    Given a set of coin values $\\texttt{coins} = \\{c_1,c_2,\\ldots,c_k\\}$\n    and a target sum of money $n$, our task is to\n    form the sum $n$ using as few coins as possible.\n\n    In Chapter 6, we solved the problem using a\n    greedy algorithm that always chooses the largest\n    possible coin.\n    The greedy algorithm works, for example,\n    when the coins are the euro coins,\n    but in the general case the greedy algorithm\n    does not necessarily produce an optimal solution.\n\n    Now is time to solve the problem efficiently\n    using dynamic programming, so that the algorithm\n    works for any coin set.\n    The dynamic programming\n    algorithm is based on a recursive function\n    that goes through all possibilities how to\n    form the sum, like a brute force algorithm.\n    However, the dynamic programming\n    algorithm is efficient because\n    it uses \\emph{memoization} and\n    calculates the answer to each subproblem only once.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Recursive formulation}\n\n    The idea in dynamic programming is to\n    formulate the problem recursively so\n    that the solution to the problem can be\n    calculated from solutions to smaller\n    subproblems.\n    In the coin problem, a natural recursive\n    problem is as follows:\n    what is the smallest number of coins\n    required to form a sum $x$?\n\n    Let $\\texttt{solve}(x)$\n    denote the minimum\n    number of coins required for a sum $x$.\n    The values of the function depend on the\n    values of the coins.\n    For example, if $\\texttt{coins} = \\{1,3,4\\}$,\n    the first values of the function are as follows:\n\n    \\[\n    \\begin{array}{lcl}\n    \\texttt{solve}(0) & = & 0 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(1) & = & 1 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(2) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(3) & = & 1 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(4) & = & 1 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(5) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(6) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(7) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(8) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(9) & = & 3 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(10) & = & 3 \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    \\]\n\n    For example, $\\texttt{solve}(10)=3$,\n    because at least 3 coins are needed\n    to form the sum 10.\n    The optimal solution is $3+3+4=10$.\n\n    The essential property of $\\texttt{solve}$ is\n    that its values can be\n    recursively calculated from its smaller values.\n    The idea is to focus on the \\emph{first}\n    coin that we choose for the sum.\n    For example, in the above scenario,\n    the first coin can be either 1, 3 or 4.\n    If we first choose coin 1,\n    the remaining task is to form the sum 9\n    using the minimum number of coins,\n    which is a subproblem of the original problem.\n    Of course, the same applies to coins 3 and 4.\n    Thus, we can use the following recursive formula\n    to calculate the minimum number of coins:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n    \\begin{split}\n    \\texttt{solve}(x) = \\min( & \\texttt{solve}(x-1)+1, \\\\\n                               & \\texttt{solve}(x-3)+1, \\\\\n                               & \\texttt{solve}(x-4)+1).\n    \\end{split}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    The base case of the recursion is $\\texttt{solve}(0)=0$,\n    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.\n    For example,\n    \\[ \\texttt{solve}(10) = \\texttt{solve}(7)+1 = \\texttt{solve}(4)+2 = \\texttt{solve}(0)+3 = 3.\\]\n\n    Now we are ready to give a general recursive function\n    that calculates the minimum number of\n    coins needed to form a sum $x$:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        \\texttt{solve}(x) = \\begin{cases}\n                   \\infty               & x < 0\\\\\n                   0               & x = 0\\\\\n                   \\min_{c \\in \\texttt{coins}} \\texttt{solve}(x-c)+1 & x > 0 \\\\\n               \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation*}\n\n    First, if $x<0$, the value is $\\infty$,\n    because it is impossible to form a negative\n    sum of money.\n    Then, if $x=0$, the value is $0$,\n    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.\n    Finally, if $x>0$, the variable $c$ goes through\n    all possibilities how to choose the first coin\n    of the sum.\n\n    Once a recursive function that solves the problem\n    has been found,\n    we can directly implement a solution in C++\n    (the constant \\texttt{INF} denotes infinity):\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int solve(int x) {\n        if (x < 0) return INF;\n        if (x == 0) return 0;\n        int best = INF;\n        for (auto c : coins) {\n            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);\n        }\n        return best;\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Still, this function is not efficient,\n    because there may be an exponential number of ways\n    to construct the sum.\n    However, next we will see how to make the\n    function efficient using a technique called memoization.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Using memoization}\n\n    \\index{memoization}\n\n    The idea of dynamic programming is to use\n    \\key{memoization} to efficiently calculate\n    values of a recursive function.\n    This means that the values of the function\n    are stored in an array after calculating them.\n    For each parameter, the value of the function\n    is calculated recursively only once, and after this,\n    the value can be directly retrieved from the array.\n\n    In this problem, we use arrays\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    bool ready[N];\n    int value[N];\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    where $\\texttt{ready}[x]$ indicates\n    whether the value of $\\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been calculated,\n    and if it is, $\\texttt{value}[x]$\n    contains this value.\n    The constant $N$ has been chosen so\n    that all required values fit in the arrays.\n\n    Now the function can be efficiently\n    implemented as follows:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int solve(int x) {\n        if (x < 0) return INF;\n        if (x == 0) return 0;\n        if (ready[x]) return value[x];\n        int best = INF;\n        for (auto c : coins) {\n            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);\n        }\n        value[x] = best;\n        ready[x] = true;\n        return best;\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The function handles the base cases\n    $x<0$ and $x=0$ as previously.\n    Then the function checks from\n    $\\texttt{ready}[x]$ if\n    $\\texttt{solve}(x)$ has already been stored\n    in $\\texttt{value}[x]$,\n    and if it is, the function directly returns it.\n    Otherwise the function calculates the value\n    of $\\texttt{solve}(x)$\n    recursively and stores it in $\\texttt{value}[x]$.\n\n    This function works efficiently,\n    because the answer for each parameter $x$\n    is calculated recursively only once.\n    After a value of $\\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been stored in $\\texttt{value}[x]$,\n    it can be efficiently retrieved whenever the\n    function will be called again with the parameter $x$.\n    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(nk)$,\n    where $n$ is the target sum and $k$ is the number of coins.\n\n    Note that we can also \\emph{iteratively}\n    construct the array \\texttt{value} using\n    a loop that simply calculates all the values\n    of $\\texttt{solve}$ for parameters $0 \\ldots n\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Dynamic programming\n    Section: Knapsack problems\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Knapsack problems}\n\n    \\index{knapsack}\n\n    The term \\key{knapsack} refers to problems where\n    a set of objects is given, and \n    subsets with some properties\n    have to be found.\n    Knapsack problems can often be solved\n    using dynamic programming.\n\n    In this section, we focus on the following\n    problem: Given a list of weights\n    $[w_1,w_2,\\ldots,w_n]$,\n    determine all\n    sums that can be constructed using the weights.\n    For example, if the weights are\n    $[1,3,3,5]$, the following sums are possible:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rrrrrrrrrrrrr}\n     0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\\\\n    \\hline\n     X & X & & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & & X & X \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    In this case, all sums between $0 \\ldots 12$\n    are possible, except 2 and 10.\n    For example, the sum 7 is possible because we\n    can select the weights $[1,3,3]$.\n\n    To solve the problem, we focus on subproblems\n    where we only use the first $k$ weights\n    to construct sums.\n    Let $\\texttt{possible}(x,k)=\\textrm{true}$ if\n    we can construct a sum $x$\n    using the first $k$ weights,\n    and otherwise $\\texttt{possible}(x,k)=\\textrm{false}$.\n    The values of the function can be recursively\n    calculated as follows:\n    \\[ \\texttt{possible}(x,k) = \\texttt{possible}(x-w_k,k-1) \\lor \\texttt{possible}(x,k-1) \\]\n    The formula is based on the fact that we can\n    either use or not use the weight $w_k$ in the sum.\n    If we use $w_k$, the remaining task is to\n    form the sum $x-w_k$ using the first $k-1$ weights,\n    and if we do not use $w_k$,\n    the remaining task is to form the sum $x$\n    using the first $k-1$ weights.\n    As the base cases,\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        \\texttt{possible}(x,0) = \\begin{cases}\n                   \\textrm{true}    & x = 0\\\\\n                   \\textrm{false}   & x \\neq 0 \\\\\n               \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    because if no weights are used,\n    we can only form the sum 0.\n\n    The following table shows all values of the function\n    for the weights $[1,3,3,5]$ (the symbol ''X''\n    indicates the true values):\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{r|rrrrrrrrrrrrr}\n    $k \\backslash x$ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\\\\n    \\hline\n     0 & X & \\\\\n     1 & X & X \\\\\n     2 & X & X & & X & X \\\\\n     3 & X & X & & X & X & & X & X \\\\\n     4 & X & X & & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & & X & X \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    After calculating those values, $\\texttt{possible}(x,n)$\n    tells us whether we can construct a\n    sum $x$ using \\emph{all} weights.\n\n    Let $W$ denote the total sum of the weights.\n    The following $O(nW)$ time\n    dynamic programming solution\n    corresponds to the recursive function:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    possible[0][0] = true;\n    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {\n        for (int x = 0; x <= W; x++) {\n            if (x-w[k] >= 0) possible[x][k] |= possible[x-w[k]][k-1];\n            possible[x][k] |= possible[x][k-1];\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    However, here is a better implementation that only uses\n    a one-dimensional array $\\texttt{possible}[x]$\n    that indicates whether we can construct a subset with sum $x$.\n    The trick is to update the array from right to left for\n    each new weight:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    possible[0] = true;\n    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {\n        for (int x = W; x >= 0; x--) {\n            if (possible[x]) possible[x+w[k]] = true;\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Note that the general idea presented here can be used\n    in many knapsack problems.\n    For example, if we are given objects with weights and values,\n    we can determine for each weight sum the maximum value\n    sum of a subset.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The code efficiently computes the result without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints of the problem. \n\nHere\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:\n        total_weight = sum(stones)\n        target = total_weight // 2\n        \n        dp = [False] * (target + 1)\n        dp[0] = True\n        \n        for weight in stones:\n            for j in range(target, weight - 1, -1):\n                dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - weight]\n        \n        for j in range(target, -1, -1):\n            if dp[j]:\n                return total_weight - 2 * j\n``` \n\nThis summary encapsulates the core concepts, the strategy used, and the successful implementation of the solution."

        "content": "The official solution employs a set-based dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of minimizing the weight of the last remaining rock. The key insights from this solution are as follows:\n\n1. **Set for Achievable Sums**: Instead of using a boolean array to track achievable sums, the official solution uses a set `dp` to store all possible sums that can be formed with the given rock weights. This allows for more flexibility and avoids the need for a fixed size array.\n\n2. **Iterative Sum Calculation**: For each rock weight, the solution updates the set `dp` by adding the current stone's weight to each of the sums already in the set. This effectively generates all possible sums that can be formed with the rocks processed so far.\n\n3. **Final Calculation**: After processing all rocks, the solution calculates the minimum possible weight of the last stone by evaluating the absolute difference between the total weight and twice each sum in the set. This is based on the idea that the remaining weight can be derived from the difference between the total weight and the sum of one of the partitions.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The use of a set allows for dynamic growth of achievable sums without the constraints of a fixed array size, making the solution both space-efficient and straightforward.\n\nIn contrast, my initial approach used a boolean array which, while effective, could be less efficient in terms of space and did not leverage the flexibility of a set to dynamically track achievable sums. The official solution's method of directly calculating the minimum weight from the set of sums is also more elegant and concise. Overall, the official solution provides a more optimal and clear approach to the problem."

        "content": "\n[description]\nThis function calculates the minimum possible weight of the last stone after performing a series of operations on a list of stone weights. It first computes the total weight of all stones and determines a target weight that represents half of this total. A dynamic programming approach is used to track achievable sums up to this target weight. For each stone, it updates the possible sums that can be formed. Finally, it identifies the largest achievable sum and computes the minimum weight of the last stone based on this value. The result is returned as the difference between the total weight and twice the largest achievable sum.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios involving optimization problems where you need to minimize or maximize a certain value based on a set of constraints. It can be applied in resource allocation, game theory, and dynamic programming problems where you need to make decisions based on previous outcomes. Understanding how to manipulate weights and achieve a target sum can also be beneficial in fields like operations research and logistics, where balancing loads or minimizing costs is essential."
