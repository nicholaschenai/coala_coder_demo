    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We have a collection of rocks, each with a positive integer weight. When we smash two rocks together, if they have the same weight, they both get destroyed. If they have different weights, the lighter rock is destroyed, and the heavier rock's weight is reduced by the weight of the lighter rock. The goal is to determine the smallest possible weight of the remaining rock after performing all possible smash operations.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution**: \n   The problem can be approached using dynamic programming. The idea is to find a way to partition the rocks into two groups such that the difference in their total weights is minimized. This is similar to the \"subset sum problem\" where we want to find a subset of numbers that adds up to a specific value. By calculating the total weight of all rocks and trying to find the closest possible sum to half of that total, we can determine the smallest possible weight of the remaining rock.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Calculate the total weight of all rocks.\n   - Initialize a boolean array `dp` where `dp[i]` indicates whether a sum `i` can be formed using the weights of the rocks.\n   - Set `dp[0]` to `True` (sum of 0 can always be formed).\n   - For each rock weight, update the `dp` array from the back to the front.\n   - After processing all rocks, find the largest `j` such that `dp[j]` is `True` and `j` is less than or equal to half of the total weight.\n   - The result will be the total weight minus twice `j`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:\n        total_weight = sum(stones)\n        target = total_weight // 2\n        \n        # Initialize a dp array to keep track of achievable sums\n        dp = [False] * (target + 1)\n        dp[0] = True  # We can always form the sum 0\n        \n        # Process each stone\n        for weight in stones:\n            for j in range(target, weight - 1, -1):\n                dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - weight]\n        \n        # Find the largest j such that dp[j] is True\n        for j in range(target, -1, -1):\n            if dp[j]:\n                return total_weight - 2 * j  # The minimum possible weight of the last stone\n```",
