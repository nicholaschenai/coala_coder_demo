INFO - [Task id] 495 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a collection of rocks, each with a positive weight. When we smash two rocks together, if they have the same weight, they both get destroyed. If they have different weights, the lighter one gets destroyed, and the heavier one loses weight equal to the lighter one. Our goal is to determine the smallest possible weight of the remaining rock after performing a series of these smash operations.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can think of it as a variation of the "subset sum" problem. We want to find a way to partition the rocks into two groups such that the difference in their total weights is minimized. The smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock will be half of the total weight of all rocks minus the weight of the closest subset we can form to that half. This can be approached using dynamic programming to keep track of possible weights we can achieve with the given rocks.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   1. Calculate the total weight of all rocks.
   2. Initialize a boolean array dp of size (total_weight // 2 + 1) to keep track of achievable weights.
   3. Set dp[0] to True (0 weight is always achievable).
   4. For each rock in the list:
      a. Update the dp array from back to front (to avoid using the same rock multiple times).
   5. Find the largest weight that can be achieved which is less than or equal to total_weight // 2.
   6. The result will be total_weight - 2 * closest_weight.
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        # Step 2: Initialize a boolean array to track achievable weights
        dp = [False] * (total_weight // 2 + 1)
        dp[0] = True  # 0 weight is always achievable

    \chapter{Dynamic programming}

    \index{dynamic programming}

    \key{Dynamic programming}
    is a technique that combines the correctness
    of complete search and the efficiency
    of greedy algorithms.
    Dynamic programming can be applied if the
    problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems
    that can be solved independently.

    There are two uses for dynamic programming:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    \key{Finding an optimal solution}:
    We want to find a solution that is
    as large as possible or as small as possible.
    \item
    \key{Counting the number of solutions}:
    We want to calculate the total number of
    possible solutions.
    \end{itemize}

    We will first see how dynamic programming can
    be used to find an optimal solution,
    and then we will use the same idea for
    counting the solutions.

    Understanding dynamic programming is a milestone
    in every competitive programmer's career.
    While the basic idea is simple,
    the challenge is how to apply
    dynamic programming to different problems.
    This chapter introduces a set of classic problems
    that are a good starting point.

    \section{Coin problem}

    We first focus on a problem that we
    have already seen in Chapter 6:
    Given a set of coin values $\texttt{coins} = \{c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_k\}$
    and a target sum of money $n$, our task is to
    form the sum $n$ using as few coins as possible.

    In Chapter 6, we solved the problem using a
    greedy algorithm that always chooses the largest
    possible coin.
    The greedy algorithm works, for example,
    when the coins are the euro coins,
    but in the general case the greedy algorithm
    does not necessarily produce an optimal solution.

    Now is time to solve the problem efficiently
    using dynamic programming, so that the algorithm
    works for any coin set.
    The dynamic programming
    algorithm is based on a recursive function
    that goes through all possibilities how to
    form the sum, like a brute force algorithm.
    However, the dynamic programming
    algorithm is efficient because
    it uses \emph{memoization} and
    calculates the answer to each subproblem only once.

    \subsubsection{Recursive formulation}

    The idea in dynamic programming is to
    formulate the problem recursively so
    that the solution to the problem can be
    calculated from solutions to smaller
    subproblems.
    In the coin problem, a natural recursive
    problem is as follows:
    what is the smallest number of coins
    required to form a sum $x$?

    Let $\texttt{solve}(x)$
    denote the minimum
    number of coins required for a sum $x$.
    The values of the function depend on the
    values of the coins.
    For example, if $\texttt{coins} = \{1,3,4\}$,
    the first values of the function are as follows:

    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    \texttt{solve}(0) & = & 0 \\
    \texttt{solve}(1) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{solve}(2) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(3) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{solve}(4) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{solve}(5) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(6) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(7) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(8) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(9) & = & 3 \\
    \texttt{solve}(10) & = & 3 \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    For example, $\texttt{solve}(10)=3$,
    because at least 3 coins are needed
    to form the sum 10.
    The optimal solution is $3+3+4=10$.

    The essential property of $\texttt{solve}$ is
    that its values can be
    recursively calculated from its smaller values.
    The idea is to focus on the \emph{first}
    coin that we choose for the sum.
    For example, in the above scenario,
    the first coin can be either 1, 3 or 4.
    If we first choose coin 1,
    the remaining task is to form the sum 9
    using the minimum number of coins,
    which is a subproblem of the original problem.
    Of course, the same applies to coins 3 and 4.
    Thus, we can use the following recursive formula
    to calculate the minimum number of coins:
    \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
    \texttt{solve}(x) = \min( & \texttt{solve}(x-1)+1, \\
                               & \texttt{solve}(x-3)+1, \\
                               & \texttt{solve}(x-4)+1).
    \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    The base case of the recursion is $\texttt{solve}(0)=0$,
    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.
    For example,
    \[ \texttt{solve}(10) = \texttt{solve}(7)+1 = \texttt{solve}(4)+2 = \texttt{solve}(0)+3 = 3.\]

    Now we are ready to give a general recursive function
    that calculates the minimum number of
    coins needed to form a sum $x$:
    \begin{equation*}
        \texttt{solve}(x) = \begin{cases}
                   \infty               & x < 0\\
                   0               & x = 0\\
                   \min_{c \in \texttt{coins}} \texttt{solve}(x-c)+1 & x > 0 \\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    First, if $x<0$, the value is $\infty$,
    because it is impossible to form a negative
    sum of money.
    Then, if $x=0$, the value is $0$,
    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.
    Finally, if $x>0$, the variable $c$ goes through
    all possibilities how to choose the first coin
    of the sum.

    Once a recursive function that solves the problem
    has been found,
    we can directly implement a solution in C++
    (the constant \texttt{INF} denotes infinity):

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int solve(int x) {
        if (x < 0) return INF;
        if (x == 0) return 0;
        int best = INF;
        for (auto c : coins) {
            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);
        }
        return best;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Still, this function is not efficient,
    because there may be an exponential number of ways
    to construct the sum.
    However, next we will see how to make the
    function efficient using a technique called memoization.

    \subsubsection{Using memoization}

    \index{memoization}

    The idea of dynamic programming is to use
    \key{memoization} to efficiently calculate
    values of a recursive function.
    This means that the values of the function
    are stored in an array after calculating them.
    For each parameter, the value of the function
    is calculated recursively only once, and after this,
    the value can be directly retrieved from the array.

    In this problem, we use arrays
    \begin{lstlisting}
    bool ready[N];
    int value[N];
    \end{lstlisting}

    where $\texttt{ready}[x]$ indicates
    whether the value of $\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been calculated,
    and if it is, $\texttt{value}[x]$
    contains this value.
    The constant $N$ has been chosen so
    that all required values fit in the arrays.

    Now the function can be efficiently
    implemented as follows:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int solve(int x) {
        if (x < 0) return INF;
        if (x == 0) return 0;
        if (ready[x]) return value[x];
        int best = INF;
        for (auto c : coins) {
            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);
        }
        value[x] = best;
        ready[x] = true;
        return best;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The function handles the base cases
    $x<0$ and $x=0$ as previously.
    Then the function checks from
    $\texttt{ready}[x]$ if
    $\texttt{solve}(x)$ has already been stored
    in $\texttt{value}[x]$,
    and if it is, the function directly returns it.
    Otherwise the function calculates the value
    of $\texttt{solve}(x)$
    recursively and stores it in $\texttt{value}[x]$.

    This function works efficiently,
    because the answer for each parameter $x$
    is calculated recursively only once.
    After a value of $\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been stored in $\texttt{value}[x]$,
    it can be efficiently retrieved whenever the
    function will be called again with the parameter $x$.
    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(nk)$,
    where $n$ is the target sum and $k$ is the number of coins.

    Note that we can also \emph{iteratively}
    construct the array \texttt{value} using
    a loop that simply calculates all the values
    of $\texttt{solve}$ for parameters $0 \ldots n

    Section: Knapsack problems
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Knapsack problems}

    \index{knapsack}

    The term \key{knapsack} refers to problems where
    a set of objects is given, and 
    subsets with some properties
    have to be found.
    Knapsack problems can often be solved
    using dynamic programming.

    In this section, we focus on the following
    problem: Given a list of weights
    $[w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_n]$,
    determine all
    sums that can be constructed using the weights.
    For example, if the weights are
    $[1,3,3,5]$, the following sums are possible:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrrrrrrrrrrr}
     0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
    \hline
     X & X & & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & & X & X \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    In this case, all sums between $0 \ldots 12$
    are possible, except 2 and 10.
    For example, the sum 7 is possible because we
    can select the weights $[1,3,3]$.

    To solve the problem, we focus on subproblems
    where we only use the first $k$ weights
    to construct sums.
    Let $\texttt{possible}(x,k)=\textrm{true}$ if
    we can construct a sum $x$
    using the first $k$ weights,
    and otherwise $\texttt{possible}(x,k)=\textrm{false}$.
    The values of the function can be recursively
    calculated as follows:
    \[ \texttt{possible}(x,k) = \texttt{possible}(x-w_k,k-1) \lor \texttt{possible}(x,k-1) \]
    The formula is based on the fact that we can
    either use or not use the weight $w_k$ in the sum.
    If we use $w_k$, the remaining task is to
    form the sum $x-w_k$ using the first $k-1$ weights,
    and if we do not use $w_k$,
    the remaining task is to form the sum $x$
    using the first $k-1$ weights.
    As the base cases,
    \begin{equation*}
        \texttt{possible}(x,0) = \begin{cases}
                   \textrm{true}    & x = 0\\
                   \textrm{false}   & x \neq 0 \\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    because if no weights are used,
    we can only form the sum 0.

    The following table shows all values of the function
    for the weights $[1,3,3,5]$ (the symbol ''X''
    indicates the true values):

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{r|rrrrrrrrrrrrr}
    $k \backslash x$ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
    \hline
     0 & X & \\
     1 & X & X \\
     2 & X & X & & X & X \\
     3 & X & X & & X & X & & X & X \\
     4 & X & X & & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & & X & X \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    After calculating those values, $\texttt{possible}(x,n)$
    tells us whether we can construct a
    sum $x$ using \emph{all} weights.

    Let $W$ denote the total sum of the weights.
    The following $O(nW)$ time
    dynamic programming solution
    corresponds to the recursive function:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    possible[0][0] = true;
    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
        for (int x = 0; x <= W; x++) {
            if (x-w[k] >= 0) possible[x][k] |= possible[x-w[k]][k-1];
            possible[x][k] |= possible[x][k-1];
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    However, here is a better implementation that only uses
    a one-dimensional array $\texttt{possible}[x]$
    that indicates whether we can construct a subset with sum $x$.
    The trick is to update the array from right to left for
    each new weight:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    possible[0] = true;
    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
        for (int x = W; x >= 0; x--) {
            if (possible[x]) possible[x+w[k]] = true;
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Note that the general idea presented here can be used
    in many knapsack problems.
    For example, if we are given objects with weights and values,
    we can determine for each weight sum the maximum value
    sum of a subset.

INFO - [Task id] 495 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We have a collection of rocks, each with a positive integer weight. When we smash two rocks together, if they have the same weight, they both get destroyed. If they have different weights, the lighter rock is destroyed, and the heavier rock's weight is reduced by the weight of the lighter rock. The goal is to determine the smallest possible weight of the remaining rock after performing all possible smash operations.

2. **Conceptualize a solution**: 
   The problem can be approached using dynamic programming. The idea is to find a way to partition the rocks into two groups such that the difference in their total weights is minimized. This is similar to the "subset sum problem" where we want to find a subset of numbers that adds up to a specific value. By calculating the total weight of all rocks and trying to find the closest possible sum to half of that total, we can determine the smallest possible weight of the remaining rock.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Calculate the total weight of all rocks.
   - Initialize a boolean array `dp` where `dp[i]` indicates whether a sum `i` can be formed using the weights of the rocks.
   - Set `dp[0]` to `True` (sum of 0 can always be formed).
   - For each rock weight, update the `dp` array from the back to the front.
   - After processing all rocks, find the largest `j` such that `dp[j]` is `True` and `j` is less than or equal to half of the total weight.
   - The result will be the total weight minus twice `j`.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.
Each turn, we choose any two rocks and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.

At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the smallest possible weight of this stone (the weight is 0 if there are no stones left.)
 
Example 1:
Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,
we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the optimal value.

INFO - [Task id] 495 [generation text] The problem involves determining the smallest possible weight of a remaining rock after a series of smash operations on a collection of rocks with positive integer weights. The key insight is that this can be framed as a dynamic programming problem similar to the subset sum problem, where the goal is to partition the rocks into two groups with minimal weight difference.

The solution involves calculating the total weight of the rocks and using a boolean array to track achievable sums up to half of that total weight. By iterating through each rock and updating the achievable sums, we can find the largest sum that can be formed, which helps in determining the minimum weight of the last remaining rock.

The final implementation successfully passed the provided test case, demonstrating that the approach is effective. The code efficiently computes the result without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints of the problem. 

Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

```python
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        total_weight = sum(stones)
        target = total_weight // 2

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = {0}
        total = sum(stones)
        for stone in stones:
            dp |= {_sum + stone for _sum in dp}
        return min(abs(total - _sum - _sum) for _sum in dp)

INFO - [Task id] 495 [generation text] The official solution employs a set-based dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of minimizing the weight of the last remaining rock. The key insights from this solution are as follows:

1. **Set for Achievable Sums**: Instead of using a boolean array to track achievable sums, the official solution uses a set `dp` to store all possible sums that can be formed with the given rock weights. This allows for more flexibility and avoids the need for a fixed size array.

2. **Iterative Sum Calculation**: For each rock weight, the solution updates the set `dp` by adding the current stone's weight to each of the sums already in the set. This effectively generates all possible sums that can be formed with the rocks processed so far.

3. **Final Calculation**: After processing all rocks, the solution calculates the minimum possible weight of the last stone by evaluating the absolute difference between the total weight and twice each sum in the set. This is based on the idea that the remaining weight can be derived from the difference between the total weight and the sum of one of the partitions.

4. **Efficiency**: The use of a set allows for dynamic growth of achievable sums without the constraints of a fixed array size, making the solution both space-efficient and straightforward.

In contrast, my initial approach used a boolean array which, while effective, could be less efficient in terms of space and did not leverage the flexibility of a set to dynamically track achievable sums. The official solution's method of directly calculating the minimum weight from the set of sums is also more elegant and concise. Overall, the official solution provides a more optimal and clear approach to the problem.

    We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.
    Each turn, we choose any two rocks and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:

    If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
    If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.

    At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the smallest possible weight of this stone (the weight is 0 if there are no stones left.)
 
    Example 1:
    Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: 
    We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,
    we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
    we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
    we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the optimal value.

 
    Note:

    1 <= stones.length <= 30
    1 <= stones[i] <= 100

[Solution]

    class Solution:
        def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
            total_weight = sum(stones)
            target = total_weight // 2
        
            # Initialize a dp array to keep track of achievable sums
            dp = [False] * (target + 1)
            dp[0] = True  # We can always form the sum 0
        
            # Process each stone
            for weight in stones:
                for j in range(target, weight - 1, -1):
                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - weight]
        
            # Find the largest j such that dp[j] is True
            for j in range(target, -1, -1):
                if dp[j]:
                    return total_weight - 2 * j  # The minimum possible weight of the last stone
