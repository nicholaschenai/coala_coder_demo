Print the LIS lengths for each vertex.\n\nHere\u2019s the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef longest_increasing_subsequence(sequence):\n    if not sequence:\n        return 0\n    d = [1] * len(sequence)\n    for i in range(1, len(sequence)):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if sequence[j] < sequence[i]:\n                d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n    return max(d)\n\ndef dfs(tree, vertex, visited, path, values):\n    visited[vertex] = True\n    path.append(values[vertex - 1])  # Store the value of the current vertex\n    for neighbor in tree[vertex]:\n        if not visited[neighbor]:\n            dfs(tree, neighbor, visited, path, values)\n    return path\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    values = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    \n    # Create the adjacency list for the tree\n    tree = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]\n    for i in range(2, N + 1):\n        u, v = map(int, data[i].split())\n        tree[u].append(v)\n        tree[v].append(u)\n    \n    # For each vertex from 1 to N, find the path from 1 to k\n    for k in range(1, N + 1):\n        visited = [False] * (N + 1)\n        path = []\n        dfs(tree, 1, visited, path, values)\n        # Now we need to find the path to vertex k\n        if k in path:\n            lis_length = longest_increasing_subsequence(path)\n            print(lis_length)\n        else:\n            print(0)  # If no path found, though this shouldn't happen in a tree\n\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **DFS Logic**: The `dfs` function now correctly appends the value of the current vertex to the path.\n2. **LIS Calculation**: The LIS is calculated for the path collected during the DFS traversal.\n3. **Output**: The lengths of the LIS for each vertex are printed directly.\n\nThis code should now correctly compute the required outputs for the problem statement, ensuring that the paths are correctly traversed and the LIS is calculated for each vertex from vertex 1.",
