    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of values along the shortest path from vertex 1 to each vertex k in a tree structure. The main challenges included correctly traversing the tree to find paths and accurately calculating the LIS for those paths.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n1. **Tree Representation**: The tree was represented using an adjacency list, which is efficient for traversal.\n2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: DFS was used to explore paths from the root vertex (1) to each target vertex (k). This required careful management of visited nodes to avoid cycles and ensure correct path retrieval.\n3. **Dynamic Programming for LIS**: The LIS was calculated using a dynamic programming approach, which involved maintaining an array to track the longest subsequence lengths.\n\n### Strategies and Issues:\n- Initial attempts to collect paths using a single DFS function did not yield the correct paths for each vertex. The function needed to be modified to backtrack correctly and ensure paths were stored for each target vertex.\n- The output handling was also problematic; the main function needed to ensure that results were printed correctly after calculating the LIS for each path.\n\n### Code Snippet:\nHere\u2019s a simplified version of the core logic used to find the LIS along the paths:\n\n```python\ndef longest_increasing_subsequence(sequence):\n    d = [1] * len(sequence)\n    for i in range(1, len(sequence)):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if sequence[j] < sequence[i]:\n                d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n    return max(d)\n\ndef find_path(tree, current, target, visited, path, values):\n    visited[current] = True\n    path.append(values[current - 1])  # Store the value of the current vertex\n    if current == target:\n        return True\n    for neighbor in tree[current]:\n        if not visited[neighbor]:\n            if find_path(tree, neighbor, target, visited, path, values):\n                return True\n    path.pop()  # Backtrack if not found\n    return False\n```\n\n### Lessons Learned:\n- Ensure that the path-finding logic correctly handles backtracking and path storage.\n- Always verify that the output format matches the expected results, especially when dealing with multiple outputs.\n- Testing edge cases and understanding the tree structure is crucial for ensuring the correctness of the traversal and LIS calculations.",
    "reflection": "In this problem-solving experience, I attempted to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) along the paths from vertex 1 to each vertex k in a tree. My initial approach involved using depth-first search (DFS) to find paths and then calculating the LIS for each path. However, my solution failed to pass the test cases due to incorrect path handling and output formatting.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n1. **Efficient Path Traversal**: The official solution uses a recursive DFS approach to traverse the tree, which is efficient for this type of problem. It maintains a global state for the LIS calculation, allowing it to update the LIS dynamically as it traverses the tree.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming with Binary Search**: The official solution employs a dynamic programming array (`dp`) to keep track of the smallest ending values of increasing subsequences of various lengths. It uses the `bisect` module to efficiently find the position to update in the `dp` array, which allows for logarithmic time complexity in updating the LIS.\n\n3. **Backtracking**: The solution also includes a mechanism to backtrack and restore the previous state of the `dp` array after exploring each vertex, ensuring that the state remains consistent for other branches of the DFS.\n\n4. **Output Handling**: The results are stored in an array (`ans`) that is printed at the end, ensuring that the output format matches the requirements.\n\n### Comparison to My Approach:\n- My approach was straightforward but lacked the efficiency of using binary search for LIS updates. The use of a simple list to store paths led to unnecessary complexity and inefficiency.\n- The official solution's use of a global state for the LIS calculation during the DFS traversal is a more elegant and efficient method than my path collection approach.\n- I did not effectively manage the state of the LIS during the traversal, which led to incorrect results.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe official solution demonstrates a more efficient and effective way to solve the problem by combining DFS with dynamic programming and binary search. This experience highlights the importance of considering state management and efficiency in algorithm design, especially in tree traversal problems.",
