    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**:\n   We have a tree structure with N vertices, where each vertex has an integer value associated with it. For each vertex from 1 to N, we need to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of the values along the shortest path from vertex 1 to that vertex.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**:\n   - First, we need to represent the tree using an adjacency list based on the edges provided.\n   - We will perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) starting from vertex 1 to find the shortest path to each vertex.\n   - For each path found, we will extract the values associated with the vertices in that path.\n   - Finally, we will compute the length of the longest increasing subsequence for each path using a dynamic programming approach.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function longest_increasing_subsequence(sequence):\n       initialize an array d of size len(sequence) with all elements as 1\n       for i from 1 to len(sequence) - 1:\n           for j from 0 to i - 1:\n               if sequence[j] < sequence[i]:\n                   d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n       return max(d)\n\n   function find_paths_from_root(tree, root):\n       initialize a list to store paths\n       perform DFS or BFS to find paths from root to all other vertices\n       return the list of paths\n\n   function main():\n       read N\n       read values a\n       read edges to form the tree\n       tree = create adjacency list from edges\n       paths = find_paths_from_root(tree, 1)\n       for each path in paths:\n           lis_length = longest_increasing_subsequence(path)\n           print(lis_length)\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef longest_increasing_subsequence(sequence):\n    # Initialize the dp array where each element is 1\n    d = [1] * len(sequence)\n    # Calculate the length of the longest increasing subsequence\n    for i in range(1, len(sequence)):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if sequence[j] < sequence[i]:\n                d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n    return max(d)\n\ndef dfs(tree, vertex, visited, path, values):\n    visited[vertex] = True\n    path.append(values[vertex])\n    for neighbor in tree[vertex]:\n        if not visited[neighbor]:\n            dfs(tree, neighbor, visited, path, values)\n    return path\n\ndef find_paths_from_root(tree, root, values):\n    visited = [False] * len(tree)\n    return dfs(tree, root, visited, [], values)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    values = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    \n    # Create the adjacency list for the tree\n    tree = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]\n    for i in range(2, N + 1):\n        u, v = map(int, data[i].split())\n        tree[u].append(v)\n        tree[v].append(u)\n    \n    # For each vertex from 1 to N, find the path from 1 to k\n    for k in range(1, N + 1):\n        path = find_paths_from_root(tree, 1, values)\n        lis_length = longest_increasing_subsequence(path)\n        print(lis_length)\n\n```",
