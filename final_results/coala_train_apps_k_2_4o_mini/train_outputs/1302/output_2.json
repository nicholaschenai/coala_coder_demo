    "raw_msg": "Given the previous insights and the understanding of the problem, I will correct the solution to ensure it accurately counts the total number of rooms that can be tiled completely based on the number of perfect squares up to `N`.\n\n### Key Points to Address:\n1. Each box `i` can only tile rooms if `i` is a perfect square.\n2. The number of perfect squares up to `N` is given by `floor(sqrt(N))`.\n3. Each perfect square contributes two rooms (one in each house).\n\n### Corrected Code:\nHere\u2019s the final Python code that implements the correct logic:\n\n```python\n# Function to count the total number of rooms that can be tiled completely\ndef count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n    for N in test_cases:\n        # Calculate the largest integer k such that k*k <= N\n        k = int(N**0.5)  # Using exponentiation to find the integer square root\n        # Each perfect square contributes 2 rooms (one in each house)\n        total_rooms = 2 * k  # This is correct as each perfect square can tile two rooms\n        print(total_rooms)\n\n# Read number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\n\n# Read each test case\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())\n    test_cases.append(N)\n\n# Call the function to process the test cases\ncount_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `count_tiled_rooms` takes the number of test cases `T` and a list of test cases `test_cases`.\n2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it calculates the largest integer `k` such that `k*k` is less than or equal to `N` using `int(N**0.5)`.\n3. **Calculate Total Rooms**: Each perfect square contributes two rooms (one in each house), so the total number of rooms is `2 * k`.\n4. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and each value of `N` from standard input.\n5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the total number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.\n\nThis code should now work correctly for the given problem statement and pass all tests.",
