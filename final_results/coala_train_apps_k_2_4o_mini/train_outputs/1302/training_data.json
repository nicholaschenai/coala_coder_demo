    "summary": "### Summary of Attempts\n\nThe problem involved calculating how many rooms in two houses can be completely tiled using tiles from boxes, where each box `i` contains `i` tiles. The key insight was that only perfect squares can tile rooms completely, as each room requires `i*i` tiles.\n\n**Core Concepts**:\n- The number of perfect squares up to `N` is given by `floor(sqrt(N))`.\n- Each perfect square contributes two rooms (one in each house).\n\n**Mistakes Made**:\n- Initially, I misinterpreted the output requirement. I calculated the total number of rooms as `2 * k`, where `k` is the number of perfect squares, but I failed to recognize that the problem specifically required counting the number of rooms that can be tiled completely from the boxes, which is `k` (the number of perfect squares) rather than `2 * k`.\n\n**Corrected Understanding**:\n- The correct output for each test case should be the number of perfect squares up to `N`, which directly translates to the number of rooms that can be tiled completely.\n\n**Final Code**:\n```python\n# Function to count the total number of rooms that can be tiled completely\ndef count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n    for N in test_cases:\n        # Calculate the largest integer k such that k*k <= N\n        k = int(N**0.5)  # Using exponentiation to find the integer square root\n        # Each perfect square contributes 1 room (one in each house)\n        total_rooms = k  # Correctly reflecting the number of rooms tiled\n        print(total_rooms)\n\n# Read number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\n\n# Read each test case\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())\n    test_cases.append(N)\n\n# Call the function to process the test cases\ncount_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n```\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of carefully interpreting problem requirements and ensuring that the output matches the expected format.",
    "reflection": "In my attempts to solve the problem, I initially misunderstood the relationship between the number of tiles in the boxes and the rooms that could be tiled. My approach focused on counting perfect squares up to `N` and multiplying that count by 2, which led to incorrect outputs. The key insight I missed was that the number of tiles in each box directly relates to the number of rooms that can be tiled, specifically that each box can only tile rooms if the number of tiles is a perfect square.\n\nThe official solution simplifies the problem significantly by recognizing that the number of rooms that can be tiled is directly related to half of `N`. By dividing `N` by 2, it effectively counts how many boxes can contribute to tiling rooms. The calculation of `k` as `2 * int(n**0.5)` directly gives the total number of rooms that can be tiled, as each perfect square contributes two rooms.\n\nThis approach is more efficient and straightforward, as it avoids unnecessary complexity in counting perfect squares individually. The official solution works because it leverages the mathematical properties of perfect squares and the relationship between the number of tiles and the rooms, leading to a correct and efficient calculation. \n\nKey takeaway: When dealing with problems involving perfect squares and distributions, it's crucial to clearly understand how the quantities relate to each other and to simplify the problem where possible.",
