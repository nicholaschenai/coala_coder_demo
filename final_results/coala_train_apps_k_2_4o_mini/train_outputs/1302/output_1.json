    "raw_msg": "Based on the insights and corrections discussed, here is the final Python code to solve the original problem regarding the tiling of rooms using tiles from boxes. The code will correctly compute the total number of rooms that can be tiled completely based on the number of perfect squares up to `N`.\n\n```python\n# Function to count the total number of rooms that can be tiled completely\ndef count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n    for N in test_cases:\n        # Calculate the largest integer k such that k*k <= N\n        k = int(N**0.5)  # Using exponentiation to find the integer square root\n        # Each perfect square contributes 2 rooms (one in each house)\n        total_rooms = 2 * k\n        print(total_rooms)\n\n# Read number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\n\n# Read each test case\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())\n    test_cases.append(N)\n\n# Call the function to process the test cases\ncount_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `count_tiled_rooms` takes the number of test cases `T` and a list of test cases `test_cases`.\n2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it calculates the largest integer `k` such that `k*k` is less than or equal to `N` using `int(N**0.5)`.\n3. **Calculate Total Rooms**: Each perfect square contributes two rooms (one in each house), so the total number of rooms is `2 * k`.\n4. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and each value of `N` from standard input.\n5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the total number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.\n\nThis code should now work correctly for the given problem statement.",
