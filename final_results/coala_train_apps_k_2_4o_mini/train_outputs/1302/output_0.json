    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The Chef has a number of boxes, each containing a specific number of tiles equal to the box number. He has two houses, each with rooms that have square floors. The goal is to determine how many rooms in both houses can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes, ensuring that the same number of tiles from a box is used for two rooms (one in each house).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   For each box containing `i` tiles, we can only tile rooms if `i` is a perfect square. This is because each room has an area of `i*i`, and we need to use all tiles from the box to tile two rooms completely. Therefore, we need to count how many perfect squares exist from `1` to `N`. The number of perfect squares up to `N` is given by the largest integer `k` such that `k*k <= N`, which is simply the integer part of the square root of `N`. Each perfect square contributes two rooms (one in each house), so the total number of rooms tiled will be `2 * k`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           N = test_case\n           k = floor(sqrt(N))  // Calculate the largest integer k such that k*k <= N\n           total_rooms = 2 * k  // Each perfect square contributes 2 rooms\n           print(total_rooms\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Function to count the total number of rooms that can be tiled completely\ndef count_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases):\n    for N in test_cases:\n        # Calculate the largest integer k such that k*k <= N\n        k = int(math.isqrt(N))  # Using isqrt for integer square root\n        # Each perfect square contributes 2 rooms (one in each house)\n        total_rooms = 2 * k\n        print(total_rooms)\n\n# Read number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\n\n# Read each test case\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())\n    test_cases.append(N)\n\n# Call the function to process the test cases\ncount_tiled_rooms(T, test_cases)\n```",
