    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We have a series of hills, each with a specific height. Participants in a jumping competition will start at a given hill and attempt to jump to the next higher hill to the right. They can jump a specified number of times. If there is no higher hill within a distance of 100 hills, they will remain on their current hill. Additionally, we can modify the heights of a range of hills by a specified amount. The task is to implement a program that can handle these operations efficiently.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   We will maintain a list of hill heights and process two types of operations:\n   - For the first type of operation, we will simulate the jumps starting from a specified hill and count how many jumps can be made to higher hills to the right. We will stop if we reach the maximum number of jumps or if there are no valid hills to jump to.\n   - For the second type of operation, we will update the heights of a specified range of hills by a given amount. This will be done directly on the list of heights.\n   We need to ensure that both operations are efficient, especially since the number of hills and operations can be large.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function jump_to_hill(heights, start_index, jumps):\n       current_index = start_index\n       for jump in range(jumps):\n           next_index = current_index + 1\n           found = False\n           while next_index < len(heights) and next_index <= current_index + 100:\n               if heights[next_index] > heights[current_index]:\n                   current_index = next_index\n                   found = True\n                   break\n               next_index += 1\n           if not found:\n               break\n       return current_index\n\n   function update_heights(heights, L, R, X):\n       for i in range(L-1, R):\n           heights[i] += X\n\n   function process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):\n       for operation in operations:\n           if operation[0] == 1:\n               i = operation[1] - 1\n               k = operation[2]\n               result = jump_to_hill(heights, i, k)\n               print(result + 1)  # Convert to 1-based index\n           elif operation[0] == 2:\n               L = operation[1]\n               R = operation[2]\n               X = operation[3]\n               update_heights(heights, L, R, X)\n\n   read N, Q\n   heights = read list of N integers\n   operations = read Q operations\n   process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef jump_to_hill(heights, start_index, jumps):\n    # Start from the given hill index\n    current_index = start_index\n    for jump in range(jumps):\n        next_index = current_index + 1\n        found = False\n        # Look for the next higher hill within the next 100 hills\n        while next_index < len(heights) and next_index <= current_index + 100:\n            if heights[next_index] > heights[current_index]:\n                current_index = next_index\n                found = True\n                break\n            next_index += 1\n        if not found:\n            break\n    return current_index\n\ndef update_heights(heights, L, R, X):\n    # Update the heights of hills from L to R by X\n    for i in range(L-1, R):\n        heights[i] += X\n\ndef process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):\n    for operation in operations:\n        if operation[0] == 1:\n            i = operation[1] - 1  # Convert to 0-based index\n            k = operation[2]\n            result = jump_to_hill(heights, i, k)\n            print(result + 1)  # Convert back to 1-based index for output\n        elif operation[0] == 2:\n            L = operation[1]\n            R = operation[2]\n            X = operation[3]\n            update_heights(heights, L, R, X)\n\n# Read input values\nN, Q = map(int, input().split())\nheights = list(map(int, input().split()))\noperations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(Q)]\nprocess_operations(N, Q, heights, operations)\n```",
