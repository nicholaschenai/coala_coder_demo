    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We have two jugs with specific capacities (x and y liters) and we want to find out if we can measure exactly z liters of water using these jugs. We can fill the jugs, empty them, or pour water from one jug to another.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if we can measure exactly z liters, we can use the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD). The key insight is that we can measure z liters if and only if:\n   - z is less than or equal to the total capacity of the two jugs (x + y).\n   - z is a multiple of the GCD of x and y. This is because any measurable amount of water using the two jugs must be a multiple of the GCD of their capacities.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function canMeasureWater(x, y, z):\n       if z > x + y:\n           return False\n       if z is a multiple of gcd(x, y):\n           return True\n       return False\n\n   function gcd(a, b):\n       while b is not 0:\n           a, b = b, a % b\n       return a\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    # Helper function to calculate GCD\n    def gcd(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:\n        while b != 0:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n\n    # Main function to determine if z liters can be measured\n    def canMeasureWater(self, x: int, y: int, z: int) -> bool:\n        # Check if z is greater than the total capacity of both jugs\n        if z > x + y:\n            return False\n        # Check if z is a multiple of the GCD of x and y\n        if z % self.gcd(x, y) == 0:\n            return True\n        return False\n```",
