## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given a stringÂ s, a kÂ duplicate removalÂ consists of choosing kÂ adjacent and equal letters fromÂ s and removingÂ them causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.
We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.
Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
Example 2:
Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
Output: "aa"
Explanation: 
First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
Example 3:
Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
Output: "ps"

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 10^5
2 <= k <= 10^4
s only contains lower case English letters.

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to take a string `s` and repeatedly remove groups of `k` adjacent identical characters until no more such groups can be found. The goal is to return the final version of the string after all possible removals.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   We can use a stack to keep track of characters and their counts. As we iterate through the string, we will push characters onto the stack. If we encounter the same character again, we will increment its count. If the count reaches `k`, we will pop that character from the stack, effectively removing it from our result. At the end of the iteration, we will reconstruct the string from the stack.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize an empty stack
   For each character in the string:
       If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the same character:
           Increment the count of that character
           If the count reaches k:
               Remove the character from the stack
       Else:
           Push the character onto the stack with a count of 1
   Construct the final string from the stack
   Return the final string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:

        stack = []

        for char in s:
            # If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the same character
            if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:
                # Increment the count of that character
                stack[-1][1] += 1
                # If the count reaches k, remove the character from the stack
                if stack[-1][1] == k:
                    stack.pop()
            else:
                # Push the character onto the stack with a count of 1
                stack.append([char, 1])
        
        # Construct the final string from the stack
        result = ''.join(char * count for char, count in stack)

[Summary]:
    The problem involved decoding a string formatted with patterns like `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times the `encoded_string` should be repeated. The solution required careful traversal of the string, handling digits, brackets, and characters appropriately.

    Key concepts included using a stack to manage nested structures and building the current number and string dynamically as we parsed the input. The approach effectively handled multiple digits and nested encodings by pushing the current state onto the stack when encountering an opening bracket and popping it when encountering a closing bracket.

    The final implementation successfully decoded the string by iterating through each character, updating the current number and string, and utilizing the stack to manage the context of nested encodings. The code snippet provided was:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
            stack = []  # Initialize a stack to keep track of numbers and strings
            current_num = 0  # To build the current number
            current_string = ""  # To build the current decoded string

            for char in s:  # Iterate through each character in the string
                if char.isdigit():  # Check if the character is a digit
                    current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)  # Build the number
                elif char == '[':  # Check for opening bracket
                    stack.append((current_string, current_num))  # Push current string and number onto stack
                    current_string = ""  # Reset current string
                    current_num = 0  # Reset current number
                elif char == ']':  # Check for closing bracket
                    last_string, num = stack.pop()  # Pop from stack
                    current_string = last_string + current_string * num  # Repeat current string and append
                else:  # If it's a regular character
                    current_string += char  # Append the character to the current string

            return current_string  # Return the fully decoded string
    ```

    The solution passed all tests, indicating that the approach was effective and correctly implemented. No unexpected errors were encountered during the process.
[/Summary]


[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.


        The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.


        You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

        Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].


        Examples:

        s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
        s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
        s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
           The task is to decode a string that contains encoded patterns. The encoding format is `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times the `encoded_string` should be repeated. The goal is to return the fully decoded string.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
           - We need to traverse the string character by character.
           - When we encounter a digit, we need to determine the full number (which could be more than one digit).
           - When we encounter an opening bracket `[`, we need to push the current number and the current decoded string onto a stack.
           - When we encounter a closing bracket `]`, we pop from the stack to get the last number and the last decoded string, then repeat the current string that many times and append it to the last decoded string.
           - Finally, we return the fully decoded string.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
           ```
           function decodeString(s):
               stack = []  # Initialize a stack to keep track of numbers and strings
               current_num = 0  # To build the current number
               current_string = ""  # To build the current decoded string

               for char in s:
                   if char is a digit:
                       current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)  # Build the number
                   elif char is '[':
                       stack.append((current_string, current_num))  # Push current string and number onto stack
                       current_string = ""  # Reset current string
                       current_num = 0  # Reset current number
                   elif char is ']':
                       last_string, num = stack.pop()  # Pop from stack
                       current_string = last_string + current_string * num  # Repeat current string and append
                   else:
                       current_string += char  # Append the character to the current string

               return current_string  # Return the fully decoded string

INFO - [Task id] 149 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to remove adjacent characters from a string that appear consecutively `k` times. We need to keep removing such groups until no more can be removed, and then return the final string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will use a stack to keep track of characters and their counts as we traverse the string.
   - For each character, we will check if it matches the top character in the stack. If it does, we increment the count.
   - If the count reaches `k`, we pop that character from the stack (effectively removing it).
   - If it does not match, we push the character onto the stack with a count of 1.
   - At the end, we will reconstruct the string from the stack.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.

    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] The problem involved removing adjacent characters from a string that appear consecutively `k` times until no more such groups can be removed. The solution utilized a stack to efficiently track characters and their counts as we processed the string. 

The core concept was to maintain a stack where each entry consists of a character and its count. As we iterated through the string, we checked if the current character matched the top of the stack. If it did, we incremented the count; if the count reached `k`, we removed that character from the stack. If it didn't match, we pushed the character onto the stack with an initial count of 1. Finally, we reconstructed the result string from the stack.

The implemented solution was effective and passed all test cases, demonstrating that the stack-based approach is a suitable strategy for this type of problem. The key takeaway is the utility of stacks for managing counts of consecutive elements, which can simplify the logic for problems involving grouping and removal.

INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] The official solution effectively utilizes a stack to manage character counts, similar to my approach. However, it simplifies the stack initialization by starting with a placeholder character and count, which helps avoid edge cases when checking for the top character. This design choice ensures that the first character can always be compared without additional checks for an empty stack.

Key insights from the official solution include:
1. **Stack Initialization**: The stack is initialized with a placeholder (`['*', 0]`), which allows for seamless comparisons without needing to check if the stack is empty.
2. **Character Comparison**: The solution checks if the current character is different from the top of the stack. If it is, it appends a new entry; if not, it increments the count.
3. **Count Management**: When the count reaches `k`, the character is removed from the stack, effectively handling the removal in a single step.
4. **Result Construction**: The final string is constructed by iterating through the stack and multiplying characters by their counts, which is efficient and straightforward.

Overall, the official solution is concise and maintains clarity while ensuring that all edge cases are handled effectively. My approach was similar but could have benefited from the initial stack setup to streamline the logic.
