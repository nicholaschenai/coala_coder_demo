    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The task is to remove adjacent characters from a string that appear consecutively `k` times. We need to keep removing such groups until no more can be removed, and then return the final string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - We will use a stack to keep track of characters and their counts as we traverse the string.\n   - For each character, we will check if it matches the top character in the stack. If it does, we increment the count.\n   - If the count reaches `k`, we pop that character from the stack (effectively removing it).\n   - If it does not match, we push the character onto the stack with a count of 1.\n   - At the end, we will reconstruct the string from the stack.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function removeDuplicates(s, k):\n       stack = []  # Initialize a stack to keep track of characters and their counts\n\n       for char in s:  # Iterate through each character in the string\n           if stack is not empty and stack top character is the same as char:\n               increment the count of the top character in the stack\n               if count reaches k:\n                   pop the top character from the stack\n           else:\n               push char onto the stack with count 1\n\n       result = \"\"  # Initialize an empty result string\n       for each character and count in the stack:\n           append character * count to result\n\n       return result  # Return the final reconstructed string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n        stack = []  # Initialize a stack to keep track of characters and their counts\n\n        for char in s:  # Iterate through each character in the string\n            if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:  # Check if the top character is the same as the current character\n                stack[-1][1] += 1  # Increment the count of the top character\n                if stack[-1][1] == k:  # If the count reaches k\n                    stack.pop()  # Remove the character from the stack\n            else:\n                stack.append([char, 1])  # Push the character onto the stack with count 1\n\n        result = \"\"  # Initialize an empty result string\n        for char, count in stack:  # Reconstruct the string from the stack\n            result += char * count  # Append character * count to result\n\n        return result  # Return the final reconstructed string\n```",
