The key insight is that this can be framed as a dynamic programming problem similar to the subset sum problem, where the goal is to partition the rocks into two groups with minimal weight difference.\n\n    The solution involves calculating the total weight of the rocks and using a boolean array to track achievable sums up to half of that total weight. By iterating through each rock and updating the achievable sums, we can find the largest sum that can be formed, which helps in determining the minimum weight of the last remaining rock.\n\n    The final implementation successfully passed the provided test case, demonstrating that the approach is effective. The code efficiently computes the result without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints of the problem. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:\n            total_weight = sum(stones)\n            target = total_weight // 2\n        \n            dp = [False] * (target + 1)\n            dp[0] = True\n        \n            for weight in stones:\n                for j in range(target, weight - 1, -1):\n                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - weight]\n        \n            for j in range(target, -1, -1):\n                if dp[j]:\n                    return total_weight - 2 * j\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the core concepts, the strategy used, and the successful implementation of the solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine the number of valid paths Ryan can take through a network of cities over a specified number of seconds while satisfying certain conditions about which cities he must be in at specific times. The approach involved using dynamic programming to track the number of ways to reach each city at each second.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Dynamic Programming (DP):** A 2D DP table was used where `dp[t][city]` represents the number of ways to be in `city` at time `t`. The table was filled by considering adjacent cities and the option to stay in the same city.\n    - **Condition Handling:** The conditions specified which city Ryan must be in at certain times, and the solution needed to account for these conditions simultaneously.\n\n    ### Strategies and Issues:\n    - The initial implementation correctly filled the DP table but failed to properly handle the conditions. The logic for counting valid trips simply multiplied the counts for each condition, which did not account for the need to satisfy all conditions together.\n    - The output format was also a concern, as the results needed to be formatted correctly for the environment.\n\n    ### Lessons Learned:\n    - It is crucial to ensure that the logic for handling multiple conditions is robust and considers the interactions between them.\n    - The final count of valid paths must reflect the simultaneous satisfaction of all conditions rather than treating them independently.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    Here is the core logic for filling the DP table and counting valid trips:\n\n    ```python\n    def count_trips(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        graph = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]\n        for u, v in roads:\n            graph[u].append(v)\n            graph[v].append(u)\n\n        dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]\n        dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0\n\n        for t in range(K):\n            for city in range(1, N + 1):\n                if dp[t][city] > 0:\n                    for neighbor in graph[city]:\n                        dp[t + 1][neighbor] = (dp[t + 1][neighbor] + dp[t][city]) % MOD\n                    dp[t + 1][city] = (dp[t + 1][city] + dp[t][city]) % MOD\n\n        valid_trips = 1\n        for a, b in conditions:\n            if b <= K:\n                valid_trips = (valid_trips * dp[b][a]) % MOD\n            else:\n                valid_trips = 0\n\n        return valid_trips\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering how conditions interact in dynamic programming problems and ensuring that the final results reflect all constraints accurately.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The right bound is calculated as the total weight divided by the number of days, which provides an upper limit on the capacity needed.\n\n2. **Binary Search Logic**: The solution iteratively narrows down the possible capacities by checking the mid-point. If the current capacity (mid) allows shipping within the given days, it attempts to find a smaller capacity by adjusting the right bound. If it exceeds the days, it increases the left bound.\n\n3. **Counting Days**: The inner loop counts how many days are needed to ship the packages with the current capacity. If the cumulative weight exceeds the mid capacity, it increments the day count and resets the current weight to the current package's weight.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The approach is efficient, as it reduces the search space logarithmically while checking the feasibility of each capacity in linear time relative to the number of packages.\n\nIn contrast, my initial solution was similar in approach but had a slight difference in how the upper bound was defined. I used the total weight as the upper limit, which could lead to unnecessary iterations. The official solution's method of calculating the right bound as `left * len(weights) // D` is more optimal, as it directly relates to the average weight that needs to be shipped per day.\n\nOverall, the official solution is effective in balancing the search space and the feasibility check, leading to a more efficient algorithm.
