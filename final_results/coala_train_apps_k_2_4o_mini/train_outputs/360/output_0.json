    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The problem is about finding the minimum weight capacity of a ship that can transport a series of packages within a specified number of days. Each package has a specific weight, and the ship can only carry a certain maximum weight each day. The goal is to determine the least weight capacity that allows all packages to be shipped in the given number of days.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach. The idea is to determine the minimum possible weight capacity of the ship that can still allow all packages to be shipped within the specified number of days. We will set the lower bound of our search to the maximum weight of a single package (since the ship must be able to carry at least the heaviest package) and the upper bound to the total weight of all packages (which would mean shipping everything in one day). We will then check for each mid-point in our search range if it is possible to ship all packages within the given days using that capacity. If it is possible, we will try a smaller capacity; if not, we will increase the capacity.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function shipWithinDays(weights, D):\n       set left to max(weights)  // minimum possible capacity\n       set right to sum(weights)  // maximum possible capacity\n\n       while left < right:\n           set mid to (left + right) // 2\n           if canShip(weights, mid, D):\n               right = mid  // try for a smaller capacity\n           else:\n               left = mid + 1  // increase capacity\n\n       return left  // the minimum capacity found\n\n   function canShip(weights, capacity, D):\n       set days to 1\n       set currentWeight to 0\n\n       for weight in weights:\n           if currentWeight + weight > capacity:\n               days += 1\n               currentWeight = weight  // start a new day\n               if days > D:\n                   return False\n           else:\n               currentWeight += weight\n\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: list[int], D: int) -> int:\n        # Set the lower bound to the maximum weight of a single package\n        left = max(weights)\n        # Set the upper bound to the total weight of all packages\n        right = sum(weights)\n\n        # Perform binary search to find the minimum capacity\n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2  # Check the middle capacity\n            if self.canShip(weights, mid, D):\n                right = mid  # If we can ship with mid capacity, try smaller\n            else:\n                left = mid + 1  # If not, increase the capacity\n\n        return left  # The minimum capacity found\n\n    def canShip(self, weights: list[int], capacity: int, D: int) -> bool:\n        days = 1  # Start with one day\n        currentWeight = 0  # Current weight loaded on the ship\n\n        for weight in weights:\n            if currentWeight + weight > capacity:\n                days += 1  # Need a new day\n                currentWeight = weight  # Start loading the new day with this weight\n                if days > D:  # If days exceed D, return False\n                    return False\n            else:\n                currentWeight += weight  # Load the weight for the current day\n\n        return True  # If we can ship within D days\n```",
