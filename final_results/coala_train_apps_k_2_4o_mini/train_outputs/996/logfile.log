## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
purposes this is sufficient.
The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
total score is declared the winner.
The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
RoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890

The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
each round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23
Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
at the end of round 1) during the game.
Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
Input
The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
â‰¤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 â‰¤ Si â‰¤
1000 and 1 â‰¤ Ti â‰¤ 1000.  
Output
Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
maximum lead attained by the winner.
Example
Input:
5
140 82

INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to determine the winner of a billiards game between two players based on their scores over several rounds. Instead of simply summing the scores, we will track the cumulative scores after each round and identify which player had the highest lead at any point during the game. The player with the maximum lead at the end of any round will be declared the winner, along with the value of that lead.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Read the number of rounds.
   - Initialize cumulative scores for both players to zero.
   - For each round, update the cumulative scores based on the scores provided.
   - Calculate the lead for the current round and determine which player is leading.
   - Keep track of the maximum lead and the corresponding player throughout all rounds.
   - Finally, output the player number with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Read integer N (number of rounds)
   Initialize cumulative_score_player1 = 0
   Initialize cumulative_score_player2 = 0
   Initialize max_lead = 0
   Initialize winner = 0

   For each round from 1 to N:
       Read scores Si (Player 1) and Ti (Player 2)
       Update cumulative_score_player1 += Si
       Update cumulative_score_player2 += Ti
       
       If cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:
           lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2
           If lead > max_lead:
               max_lead = lead
               winner = 1
       Else:
           lead = cumulative_score_player2 - cumulative_score_player1
           If lead > max_lead:
               max_lead = lead
               winner = 2

   Output winner and max_lead
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def find_winner():
    # Read the number of rounds
    N = int(input())
    
    # Initialize cumulative scores for both players
    cumulative_score_player1 = 0

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine the winner of a game played between two players based on the integer \( N \). The key insight was recognizing the impact of the parity of \( N \) on the game's outcome. If \( N \) is 1, the first player loses immediately. If \( N \) is even, the Grinch can always respond in a way that keeps him in a winning position. Conversely, if \( N \) is odd, the first player can make it even for the Grinch, leading to a win for the first player.

    The solution involved a simple function that checks the value of \( N \) and returns the winner based on these conditions. The implementation was straightforward, and the logic was sound, leading to successful test cases.

    The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def determine_winner(N):
        if N == 1:
            return "Grinch"
        if N % 2 == 0:
            return "Grinch"
        else:
            return "Me"

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        result = determine_winner(N)
        print(result)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of analyzing game theory problems through the lens of parity and strategic moves, which can simplify the decision-making process significantly.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to calculate the mean of maximum scores for students based on the complexity of questions assigned to them. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve. The challenge involved efficiently updating scores for potentially large numbers of students and questions.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate an array based on given ranges and perform arithmetic operations efficiently. The solution involved initializing an array of scores, iterating through the questions, and updating the scores for the specified range of students. After processing all questions, the mean score was calculated by summing the scores and dividing by the number of students.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that the mean score was printed as an integer. The code was structured to read input in bulk for efficiency, especially given the constraints of up to 100,000 students and questions. 

    Key takeaways include the importance of efficient array manipulation and the need to consider performance when dealing with large datasets. The solution was straightforward and did not encounter unexpected errors, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem requirements. 

    Here is the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def calculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, M = case[0]  # Number of students and questions
            scores = [10] * N  # Initialize scores for all students to 10
        
            for question in case[1]:  # Process each question
                i, j, k = question  # Get the range and complexity
                for student in range(i - 1, j):  # Update scores for students in range
                    scores[student] *= k
        
            mean_score = sum(scores) // N  # Calculate the mean score
            print(mean_score)  # Output the mean score

    # Read input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()

    T = int(data[0])  # Number of test cases
    test_cases = []
    index = 1

    for _ in range(T):
        N, M = map(int, data[index].split())
        questions = []
        for j in range(M):

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
purposes this is sufficient.
The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
total score is declared the winner.
The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
RoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890

The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
each round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23
Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
at the end of round 1) during the game.
Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
Input
The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
â‰¤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 â‰¤ Si â‰¤
1000 and 1 â‰¤ Ti â‰¤ 1000.  
Output
Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
maximum lead attained by the winner.
Example
Input:
5
140 82
89 134

   The problem involves determining the winner of a billiards game played over several rounds between two players.

INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] In this task, I was required to determine the winner of a billiards game based on scores from multiple rounds. The key concept was to track cumulative scores for two players and identify the maximum lead at the end of any round. The solution involved reading input scores, updating cumulative totals, and comparing leads after each round.

The approach I took was straightforward: I initialized cumulative scores and variables to track the maximum lead and the winner. For each round, I updated the scores, calculated the current lead, and checked if it exceeded the previously recorded maximum lead. If it did, I updated the maximum lead and determined the winner based on the cumulative scores.

The final implementation was successful, as it correctly handled the input and produced the expected output. The code snippet below encapsulates the solution:

```python
def find_winner():
    N = int(input())
    cumulative_score_player1 = 0
    cumulative_score_player2 = 0
    max_lead = 0
    winner = 0

    for _ in range(N):
        scores = input().split()
        score_player1 = int(scores[0])
        score_player2 = int(scores[1])
        
        cumulative_score_player1 += score_player1
        cumulative_score_player2 += score_player2
        
        current_lead = abs(cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2)
        
        if current_lead > max_lead:
            max_lead = current_lead
            if cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:
                winner = 1
            else:
                winner = 2

    print(winner, max_lead)

find_winner()
```

This experience reinforced the importance of maintaining state across iterations and the need for clear logic when comparing values. The problem was well-defined, and the solution was efficient, handling the constraints effectively.

INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] The official solution effectively simplifies the problem by maintaining separate cumulative scores for both players and tracking the maximum lead for each player in a more compact manner. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Initialization**: The solution initializes cumulative scores (`s1` for Player 1 and `s2` for Player 2) and maximum leads (`mlead1` for Player 1 and `mlead2` for Player 2) to zero. This sets a clear starting point for score accumulation and lead tracking.

2. **Single Loop for Input Processing**: The solution processes the input in a single loop, reading the scores for both players and updating their cumulative scores. This is efficient and straightforward, avoiding the need for additional data structures.

3. **Lead Calculation**: After updating the scores, the solution calculates the lead for the player who is currently ahead. It uses a simple conditional to determine which player's lead to update, ensuring that only the maximum lead for each player is retained.

4. **Final Decision**: At the end of the loop, the solution compares the maximum leads of both players and prints the winner along with their maximum lead. This final comparison is efficient and directly addresses the problem's requirement to determine the winner based on the maximum lead.

Overall, the official solution is concise and efficient, using minimal variables and operations to achieve the desired outcome. My initial approach was more verbose and involved additional calculations that could be streamlined, particularly in how the leads were tracked and compared. The official solution's method of maintaining separate maximum leads for each player simplifies the logic and reduces potential errors in lead tracking.

[Problem]
    The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
    on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
    purposes this is sufficient.
    The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
    obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
    have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
    adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
    total score is declared the winner.
    The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
    the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
    of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
    changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
    end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
    all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
    end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

    Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
    RoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890

    The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
    each round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23
    Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
    The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
    at the end of round 1) during the game.
    Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
    lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
    always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
    Input
    The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
    â‰¤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
    2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
    Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
    and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 â‰¤ Si â‰¤
    1000 and 1 â‰¤ Ti â‰¤ 1000.  
    Output
    Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
    W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
    maximum lead attained by the winner.
    Example
    Input:
    5
    140 82
    89 134
    90 110
    112 106
    88 90

    Output:
    1 58
