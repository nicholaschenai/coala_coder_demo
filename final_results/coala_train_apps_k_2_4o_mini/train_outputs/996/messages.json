Well, there is more to it, but for our\npurposes this is sufficient.\nThe game consists of several rounds and in each round both players\nobtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds\nhave been played, the total score of each player is determined by\nadding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher\ntotal score is declared the winner.\nThe Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where\nthe top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager\nof Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by\nchanging the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the\nend of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once\nall the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the\nend of any round in the game is declared the winner.\n\nConsider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:\nRoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890\n\nThe total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after\neach round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23\nNote that the above table contains the cumulative scores.\nThe winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58\nat the end of round 1) during the game.\nYour task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning\nlead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will\nalways be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.\nInput\nThe first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N\n\u2264 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines\n2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.\nLine i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1\nand 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 \u2264 Si \u2264\n1000 and 1 \u2264 Ti \u2264 1000.  \nOutput\nYour output must consist of a single line containing two integers\nW and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the\nmaximum lead attained by the winner.\nExample\nInput:\n5\n140 82\n89 134\n90 110\n112 106\n88 90\n\nOutput:\n1 58\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The key insight was recognizing the impact of the parity of \\( N \\) on the game's outcome. If \\( N \\) is 1, the first player loses immediately. If \\( N \\) is even, the Grinch can always respond in a way that keeps him in a winning position. Conversely, if \\( N \\) is odd, the first player can make it even for the Grinch, leading to a win for the first player.\n\n    The solution involved a simple function that checks the value of \\( N \\) and returns the winner based on these conditions. The implementation was straightforward, and the logic was sound, leading to successful test cases.\n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def determine_winner(N):\n        if N == 1:\n            return \"Grinch\"\n        if N % 2 == 0:\n            return \"Grinch\"\n        else:\n            return \"Me\"\n\n    T = int(input())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        result = determine_winner(N)\n        print(result)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of analyzing game theory problems through the lens of parity and strategic moves, which can simplify the decision-making process significantly.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to calculate the mean of maximum scores for students based on the complexity of questions assigned to them. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve. The challenge involved efficiently updating scores for potentially large numbers of students and questions.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate an array based on given ranges and perform arithmetic operations efficiently. The solution involved initializing an array of scores, iterating through the questions, and updating the scores for the specified range of students. After processing all questions, the mean score was calculated by summing the scores and dividing by the number of students.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that the mean score was printed as an integer. The code was structured to read input in bulk for efficiency, especially given the constraints of up to 100,000 students and questions. \n\n    Key takeaways include the importance of efficient array manipulation and the need to consider performance when dealing with large datasets. The solution was straightforward and did not encounter unexpected errors, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem requirements. \n\n    Here is the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, M = case[0]  # Number of students and questions\n            scores = [10] * N  # Initialize scores for all students to 10\n        \n            for question in case[1]:  # Process each question\n                i, j, k = question  # Get the range and complexity\n                for student in range(i - 1, j):  # Update scores for students in range\n                    scores[student] *= k\n        \n            mean_score = sum(scores) // N  # Calculate the mean score\n            print(mean_score)  # Output the mean score\n\n    # Read input\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n\n    T = int(data[0])  # Number of test cases\n    test_cases = []\n    index = 1\n\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, M = map(int, data[index].split())\n        questions = []\n        for j in range(M):\n            i, j, k = map(int, data[index + 1 + j].split())\n            questions.append((i, j, k))\n        test_cases.append(((N, M), questions))\n        index += M + 1\n\n    # Call the function with the parsed input\n    calculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This sets a clear starting point for score accumulation and lead tracking.\n\n2. **Single Loop for Input Processing**: The solution processes the input in a single loop, reading the scores for both players and updating their cumulative scores. This is efficient and straightforward, avoiding the need for additional data structures.\n\n3. **Lead Calculation**: After updating the scores, the solution calculates the lead for the player who is currently ahead. It uses a simple conditional to determine which player's lead to update, ensuring that only the maximum lead for each player is retained.\n\n4. **Final Decision**: At the end of the loop, the solution compares the maximum leads of both players and prints the winner along with their maximum lead. This final comparison is efficient and directly addresses the problem's requirement to determine the winner based on the maximum lead.\n\nOverall, the official solution is concise and efficient, using minimal variables and operations to achieve the desired outcome.
