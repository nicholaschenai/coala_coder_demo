    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The problem involves determining the winner of a billiards game played over several rounds between two players. After each round, we need to calculate the cumulative scores of both players and identify who had the highest lead at the end of any round. The player with the maximum lead at any point during the game is declared the winner.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Read the number of rounds and the scores for each round for both players.\n   - Maintain cumulative scores for both players as we process each round.\n   - After each round, calculate the current lead and determine if it is the maximum lead observed so far.\n   - At the end of all rounds, output the player with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_winner():\n       read N (number of rounds)\n       initialize cumulative_score_player1 = 0\n       initialize cumulative_score_player2 = 0\n       initialize max_lead = 0\n       initialize winner = 0\n\n       for each round from 1 to N:\n           read scores for player1 and player2\n           update cumulative scores for both players\n           calculate current_lead = abs(cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2)\n           \n           if current_lead > max_lead:\n               max_lead = current_lead\n               if cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:\n                   winner = 1\n               else:\n                   winner = 2\n\n       print winner and max_lead\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_winner():\n    # Read the number of rounds\n    N = int(input())\n    \n    # Initialize cumulative scores for both players\n    cumulative_score_player1 = 0\n    cumulative_score_player2 = 0\n    \n    # Initialize variables to track the maximum lead and the winner\n    max_lead = 0\n    winner = 0\n\n    # Process each round\n    for _ in range(N):\n        # Read scores for player 1 and player 2\n        scores = input().split()\n        score_player1 = int(scores[0])\n        score_player2 = int(scores[1])\n        \n        # Update cumulative scores\n        cumulative_score_player1 += score_player1\n        cumulative_score_player2 += score_player2\n        \n        # Calculate the current lead\n        current_lead = abs(cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2)\n        \n        # Check if the current lead is greater than the maximum lead observed\n        if current_lead > max_lead:\n            max_lead = current_lead\n            # Determine the winner based on cumulative scores\n            if cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:\n                winner = 1\n            else:\n                winner = 2\n\n    # Output the winner and the maximum lead\n    print(winner, max_lead)\n\n# Call the function to execute\nfind_winner()\n```",
