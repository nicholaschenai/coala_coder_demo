You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string.\n\nFind the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.\nThe second line contains the string S.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 50\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 50\n- S will consist of uppercase English letters.\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n2\n4\nDCBA\n7\nXYZZYZZ\n\nOutput:\nADCB\nXYYZZZZ\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB\nExample case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters.

The key insight was to identify the longest increasing subsequence of books that are already in the correct order. The minimum moves needed would then be the total number of books minus the length of this subsequence.\n\n    The solution involved creating an array to track the positions of each book and then iterating through the books in order to find the longest increasing subsequence based on their positions. This approach efficiently computes the result in linear time, which is crucial given the constraints (up to 200,000 books).\n\n    The final implementation successfully passed the provided test case, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def min_moves_to_sort(N, books):\n        position = [0] * (N + 1)\n        for i in range(N):\n            position[books[i]] = i\n\n        longest_increasing_length = 0\n        current_length = 0\n\n        for i in range(1, N + 1):\n            if position[i] > position[i - 1]:\n                current_length += 1\n            else:\n                longest_increasing_length = max(longest_increasing_length, current_length)\n                current_length = 1\n\n        longest_increasing_length = max(longest_increasing_length, current_length)\n\n        return N - (longest_increasing_length + 1)\n\n    # Read input\n    N = int(input())\n    books = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n    # Output the result\n    print(min_moves_to_sort(N, books))\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in sorting problems and leveraging efficient algorithms to handle large datasets.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
