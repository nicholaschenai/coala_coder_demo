## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string.

Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.
The second line contains the string S.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 50
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 50
- S will consist of uppercase English letters.

-----Example-----
Input:
2
4
DCBA
7
XYZZYZZ

Output:
ADCB
XYYZZZZ

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB
Example case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters. So the answer will be XYYZZZZ

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by moving one character from any position in a given string to any other position. We will do this for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string and consider it as the character to be moved. For each character, we will remove it from its original position and try inserting it at every possible position in the string. After each insertion, we will check if the new string is smaller than the previously found smallest string. We will keep track of the smallest string found during this process.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_smallest_string(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N = length of test_case
           S = test_case
           smallest_string = S
           
           for i from 0 to N-1:  // for each character in S
               char_to_move = S[i]
               remaining_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]  // string without the character
               
               for j from 0 to N:  // try inserting char_to_move at every position
                   new_string = remaining_string[:j] + char_to_move + remaining_string[j:]
                   if new_string < smallest_string:
                       smallest_string = new_string
           
           output smallest_string

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        The chef is having one string of English lower case alphabets only. The chef wants to remove all "abc" special pairs where a,b,c are occurring consecutively. After removing the pair, create a new string and again remove "abc" special pair from a newly formed string. Repeate the process until no such pair remains in a string.

        -----Input:-----
        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
        - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, $String$. 

        -----Output:-----
        For each testcase, output in a single line answer, new String with no "abc" special pair.

        -----Constraints:-----
        $T \leq 2 $
        $1 \leq String length \leq 1000 $

        -----Sample Input:-----

        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
           We need to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from a given string until there are no more occurrences of "abc". This process needs to be applied to multiple test cases.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
           To solve this problem, we can use a loop to check for the presence of the substring "abc" in the string. If it exists, we will remove it and check the resulting string again. We will continue this process until the substring "abc" can no longer be found in the string. This will be done for each test case provided.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function remove_abc_pairs(string):
               while "abc" is in string:
                   remove the first occurrence of "abc" from string
               return string

           function main():
               read T (number of test cases)
               for each test case:
                   read string
                   result = remove_abc_pairs(string)

           ```

            while "abc" in string:
                string = string.replace("abc", "", 1)  # Remove the first occurrence of "abc"

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a shelf of books numbered from 1 to N. The key insight was to identify the longest increasing subsequence of books that are already in the correct order. The minimum moves needed would then be the total number of books minus the length of this subsequence.

    The solution involved creating an array to track the positions of each book and then iterating through the books in order to find the longest increasing subsequence based on their positions. This approach efficiently computes the result in linear time, which is crucial given the constraints (up to 200,000 books).

    The final implementation successfully passed the provided test case, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:

    ```python
    def min_moves_to_sort(N, books):
        position = [0] * (N + 1)
        for i in range(N):
            position[books[i]] = i

        longest_increasing_length = 0
        current_length = 0

        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            if position[i] > position[i - 1]:
                current_length += 1
            else:
                longest_increasing_length = max(longest_increasing_length, current_length)
                current_length = 1

        longest_increasing_length = max(longest_increasing_length, current_length)

        return N - (longest_increasing_length + 1)

    # Read input
    N = int(input())
    books = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Output the result
    print(min_moves_to_sort(N, books))
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in sorting problems and leveraging efficient algorithms to handle large datasets.

   We need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by removing one character from a given string and inserting it back at any position. This needs to be done for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string, temporarily remove it, and then try inserting it back at every possible position in the remaining string. For each configuration, we will check if it results in a smaller string than what we have found so far. Finally, we will return the smallest string found after checking all possibilities.

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by removing one character from a given string and reinserting it at any position. The solution involved iterating through each character, removing it, and then trying to insert it back into every possible position in the remaining string. This brute-force approach ensured that all configurations were considered.

The core concept tested here was the manipulation of strings and understanding of lexicographical order. The solution effectively utilized nested loops: the outer loop for character removal and the inner loop for reinsertion, which allowed for comprehensive exploration of possible outcomes.

The final implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases. The key takeaway was the importance of systematically exploring all possible configurations when dealing with string manipulations, especially in problems involving order and arrangement. The solution was efficient given the constraints, as the maximum string length was 50, making the brute-force approach feasible. 

The final code snippet is as follows:

```python
def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):
    smallest_string = S  
    for i in range(len(S)):
        char_to_move = S[i]

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for _1 in range(int(input())):
 n=int(input())
 s=input().strip()
 answer=s
 for i in range(len(s)):
  c=s[i]
  string=s[:i]+s[i+1:]
  for j in range(len(string)+1):
   answer=min(answer, string[:j]+c+string[j:])
 print(answer)

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] The official solution closely mirrors my approach, confirming that the logic of removing a character and reinserting it at various positions is sound. Both solutions iterate through each character in the string, temporarily remove it, and then attempt to insert it back into every possible position in the remaining string. 

One key insight from the official solution is the use of the `min` function to directly compare and update the smallest string found. This is a more concise way to handle the comparison and update process, which I implemented with an explicit conditional check. The official solution also maintains clarity by using straightforward variable names and a simple structure.

In terms of performance, both solutions have similar time complexity, as they both involve nested loops iterating through the string. However, the official solution's use of `min` simplifies the code and may improve readability. 

Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of clarity and conciseness in code, as well as the effectiveness of using built-in functions for common operations like finding the minimum.
