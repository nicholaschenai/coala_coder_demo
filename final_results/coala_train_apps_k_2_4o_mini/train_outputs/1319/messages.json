He called his prime minister and ordered that all corrupt citizens be put to death. Moreover, he wanted this done quickly.\nThe wily prime minister realised that investigating every citizen to decide who was corrupt and who was not was rather difficult. So he decided on the following plan: He ordered all the citizens to appear in the court one by one and declare their wealth.\nThe king does not sit in the court all the time (he has other important business to attend to - for instance, meet dignitaries from neighbouring kingdoms, spend time with his family \u2026) Whenever the king walks into the court, the prime minister pulls out the richest man who has appeared before the court so far and is still alive and beheads him for being corrupt. Since the rich are more likely to be corrupt, he hopes to get rid of most of the corrupt and the king is happy as he sees his policy being implemented enthusiastically.\nSuppose the wealth of the citizens trooping into the court is\n1376518911241376518911241\\; 3\\; 7\\; 6\\; 5\\; 18\\;  9\\; 11\\;  2\\; 4\nand the king walked in three times: the first time after the first four persons have seen the minister, the second time after the first five persons have seen the minister and, finally after the first nine persons have seen the minister.\nAt the king's first visit the richest person to have met the minister has wealth $7$ and he would be beheaded. At the second visit, the wealth of the richest person who has met the minister and is still alive has wealth $6$ and so he would be beheaded. At the third visit the richest person to have met the minister who is still alive has wealth $18$ and so he would be beheaded.\nYou may assume that the input is such that whenever the king walks in, it is always possible to behead someone.\nYour aim is to write a program that will enable the prime minister to identify the richest man to have met the minister and who is still alive quickly. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth.\n\n-----Input:-----\nThe first line of the input consists of two numbers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of citizens in the kingdom and M is the number of visits to the court by the king.\nThe next $N+M$ lines describe the order in which the $N$ citizens' appearances are interleaved with the $M$ visits by the king. A citizen's visit is denoted by a positive integer, signifying his wealth. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth. A visit by the king is denoted by $-1$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nYour output should consist of $M$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at the $i^{th}$ visit of the king.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1 \\leq M \\leq 10000$.\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 100000$.\n- You may assume that in $50 \\%$ of the inputs $1 \\leq M \\leq 1000$ and $1 \\leq N \\leq 8000$.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n10 3\n1 \n3 \n7 \n6 \n-1 \n5 \n-1 \n18 \n9 \n11\n2\n-1\n4\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n7\n6\n18\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Citizens declare their wealth one by one, and whenever the king visits, the prime minister must identify and behead the richest citizen who has declared their wealth up to that point and is still alive. The input consists of a sequence of wealth declarations and king's visits, and the output should be the wealth of the citizens beheaded during each of the king's visits.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   We need to keep track of the wealth of citizens as they declare it. When the king visits, we need to quickly find the richest citizen who has declared their wealth and has not been beheaded yet. To do this efficiently, we can use a max-heap (or a priority queue) to keep track of the wealth of citizens. Each time a citizen declares their wealth, we add it to the heap. When the king visits, we pop the maximum wealth from the heap, which represents the richest citizen to be beheaded. We also need to ensure that we only consider citizens who are still alive.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Initialize an empty max-heap\n   Initialize an empty list for results\n\n   For each input line:\n       If the line is a positive integer (wealth):\n           Push the wealth into the max-heap\n       Else if the line is -1 (king's visit):\n           Pop the maximum wealth from the max-heap\n           Append this wealth to the results list\n\n   Print each wealth in the results list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef behead_citizens():\n    # Read the first line of input to get N and M\n    first_line = input().strip().split()\n    N = int(first_line[0])\n    M = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    # Initialize a max-heap (using negative values for max-heap simulation)\n    max_heap = []\n    results = []\n    \n    # Process each of the next N + M lines\n    for _ in range(N + M):\n        line = input().strip()\n        if line == '-1':\n            # King visits, pop the richest citizen from the heap\n            richest = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)  # Negate to get the original wealth\n            results.append(richest)\n        else:\n            # Citizen declares their wealth\n            wealth = int(line)\n            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -wealth)  # Negate to simulate max-heap\n    \n    # Output the results for each king's visit\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```"

The key concept was to track cumulative scores for two players and identify the maximum lead at the end of any round. The solution involved reading input scores, updating cumulative totals, and comparing leads after each round.\n\n    The approach I took was straightforward: I initialized cumulative scores and variables to track the maximum lead and the winner. For each round, I updated the scores, calculated the current lead, and checked if it exceeded the previously recorded maximum lead. If it did, I updated the maximum lead and determined the winner based on the cumulative scores.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, as it correctly handled the input and produced the expected output. The code snippet below encapsulates the solution:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_winner():\n        N = int(input())\n        cumulative_score_player1 = 0\n        cumulative_score_player2 = 0\n        max_lead = 0\n        winner = 0\n\n        for _ in range(N):\n            scores = input().split()\n            score_player1 = int(scores[0])\n            score_player2 = int(scores[1])\n        \n            cumulative_score_player1 += score_player1\n            cumulative_score_player2 += score_player2\n        \n            current_lead = abs(cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2)\n        \n            if current_lead > max_lead:\n                max_lead = current_lead\n                if cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:\n                    winner = 1\n                else:\n                    winner = 2\n\n        print(winner, max_lead)\n\n    find_winner()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of maintaining state across iterations and the need for clear logic when comparing values. The problem was well-defined, and the solution was efficient, handling the constraints effectively.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I implemented a solution for a hill jumping competition problem where participants jump from one hill to the next higher hill based on given operations. The problem required handling two types of operations: jumping to higher hills and updating the heights of a range of hills.\n\n    The core concepts involved were:\n    1. **Simulating Jumps**: For the first operation type, I created a function to simulate the jumps from a starting hill, checking for the next higher hill within a distance of 100. This required careful index management to ensure jumps were valid.\n    2. **Updating Heights**: For the second operation type, I implemented a straightforward function to update the heights of hills in a specified range.\n\n    The solution was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints, as it directly manipulated the list of heights and processed each operation in a linear manner. \n\n    The final implementation successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was effective. The key takeaway was the importance of managing indices correctly and ensuring that operations on the list were performed efficiently to meet the problem's constraints. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def jump_to_hill(heights, start_index, jumps):\n        current_index = start_index\n        for jump in range(jumps):\n            next_index = current_index + 1\n            found = False\n            while next_index < len(heights) and next_index <= current_index + 100:\n                if heights[next_index] > heights[current_index]:\n                    current_index = next_index\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                next_index += 1\n            if not found:\n                break\n        return current_index\n\n    def update_heights(heights, L, R, X):\n        for i in range(L-1, R):\n            heights[i] += X\n\n    def process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):\n        for operation in operations:\n            if operation[0] == 1:\n                i = operation[1] - 1\n                k = operation[2]\n                result = jump_to_hill(heights, i, k)\n                print(result + 1)\n            elif operation[0] == 2:\n                L = operation[1]\n                R = operation[2]\n                X = operation[3]\n                update_heights(heights, L, R, X)\n\n    N, Q = map(int, input().split())\n    heights = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(Q)]\n    process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations)\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"

It uses a list to store the wealth of citizens and keeps track of the length of this list to optimize the search for the richest citizen during each visit. \n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **List Management**: The solution maintains a list `l` to store the wealth of citizens. It also uses a variable `leng` to track the number of citizens who have declared their wealth, which helps avoid unnecessary iterations over the entire list.\n\n2. **Finding the Richest**: When the king visits (indicated by `-1`), the solution iterates through the list of declared wealth to find the maximum value. It keeps track of both the maximum wealth (`cm`) and its index (`mi`). This allows the program to efficiently identify which citizen to behead.\n\n3. **Marking Citizens as Deceased**: Instead of removing the wealth from the list, the solution marks the wealth of the beheaded citizen as `-1`. This avoids the overhead of list operations like removal, which can be costly in terms of time complexity.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient in terms of space since it avoids creating new lists or performing costly operations. However, it still has a linear time complexity for finding the maximum wealth during each king's visit, which could be improved with a more sophisticated data structure like a max-heap.\n\nOverall, while my initial solution was straightforward and functional, the official solution demonstrates a more efficient way to handle the problem by minimizing list operations and leveraging indexing.
