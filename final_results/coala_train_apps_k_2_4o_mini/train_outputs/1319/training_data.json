    "summary": "In this task, I implemented a solution to a problem where a king beheads the richest citizen after each of his visits to the court. The core concept involved efficiently tracking the wealth of citizens and quickly identifying the richest one during each visit. \n\nThe approach I took was to maintain a list of declared wealth values. When the king visited (indicated by `-1`), I used the `max()` function to find the richest citizen, stored their wealth in a results list, and then removed that wealth from the citizens' list. This method worked well for the problem constraints, as it allowed for straightforward wealth tracking and retrieval.\n\nOne key takeaway was the importance of managing the list of citizens effectively, especially since the wealth values were unique. The solution performed well within the provided constraints, and the implementation was straightforward without any unexpected errors. The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef find_richest_citizens():\n    N, M = map(int, input().split())\n    citizens = []\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(N + M):\n        line = input().strip()\n        \n        if line == '-1':\n            richest = max(citizens)\n            results.append(richest)\n            citizens.remove(richest)\n        else:\n            wealth = int(line)\n            citizens.append(wealth)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nfind_richest_citizens()\n```\n\nThis solution effectively meets the problem requirements and demonstrates a clear understanding of list operations and the use of built-in functions in Python.",
    "reflection": "The official solution takes a different approach to manage the wealth declarations and the king's visits. It uses a list to store the wealth of citizens and keeps track of the length of this list to optimize the search for the richest citizen during each visit. \n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **List Management**: The solution maintains a list `l` to store the wealth of citizens. It also uses a variable `leng` to track the number of citizens who have declared their wealth, which helps avoid unnecessary iterations over the entire list.\n\n2. **Finding the Richest**: When the king visits (indicated by `-1`), the solution iterates through the list of declared wealth to find the maximum value. It keeps track of both the maximum wealth (`cm`) and its index (`mi`). This allows the program to efficiently identify which citizen to behead.\n\n3. **Marking Citizens as Deceased**: Instead of removing the wealth from the list, the solution marks the wealth of the beheaded citizen as `-1`. This avoids the overhead of list operations like removal, which can be costly in terms of time complexity.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient in terms of space since it avoids creating new lists or performing costly operations. However, it still has a linear time complexity for finding the maximum wealth during each king's visit, which could be improved with a more sophisticated data structure like a max-heap.\n\nOverall, while my initial solution was straightforward and functional, the official solution demonstrates a more efficient way to handle the problem by minimizing list operations and leveraging indexing. This experience highlights the importance of considering both time and space complexity when designing algorithms.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: find_richest_citizens]\nThis function processes input to manage the wealth of citizens and the king's visits. It first reads the number of citizens and visits, then initializes lists to track citizen wealth and results. For each input line, it either records a citizen's declared wealth or identifies and removes the richest citizen during a king's visit. The wealth of the richest citizen is stored for each visit, and after processing all inputs, the results are printed. The function effectively simulates a scenario where citizens declare wealth and the king beheads the richest citizen during his visits.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where a decision-making process requires identifying the highest value from a dynamic list of inputs, especially when certain elements need to be removed after selection. It can be applied in various fields such as resource allocation, priority scheduling, and any situation where ranking and elimination based on value is necessary. For example, it can be used in competitive programming, game design for character elimination based on scores, or even in business for identifying top performers in a team who may need to be rewarded or promoted."
