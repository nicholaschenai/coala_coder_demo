    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to determine if we can modify a sequence of integers such that the sum of all elements becomes zero. The modification allowed is to decrease any element at index `i` by `i` any number of times.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can calculate the total sum of the sequence. If the sum is already zero, we can immediately return \"YES\". If the sum is positive, we need to check if we can reduce it to zero by using the allowed operations. Each element can be decreased by its index, which means we can reduce the sum by a maximum of `i` for each element `A[i]`. We need to check if the total sum can be reduced to zero by summing the maximum possible reductions we can achieve.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           N = test_case[0]\n           A = test_case[1]\n           total_sum = sum(A)\n           max_reduction = sum(i for i in range(1, N + 1))  # sum of indices from 1 to N\n           \n           if total_sum <= max_reduction:\n               print(\"YES\")\n           else:\n               print(\"NO\")\n\n   read T\n   read test_cases\n   can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):\n    # Iterate through each test case\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N = case[0]  # Read the size of the sequence\n        A = case[1]  # Read the sequence of integers\n        total_sum = sum(A)  # Calculate the total sum of the sequence\n        max_reduction = sum(i for i in range(1, N + 1))  # Calculate the maximum possible reduction\n        \n        # Check if we can reduce the total sum to zero\n        if total_sum <= max_reduction:\n            print(\"YES\")  # It's possible to make the sequence good\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")  # It's not possible to make the sequence good\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\n\n# Read each test case\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())  # Read the size of the sequence\n    A = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the sequence of integers\n    test_cases.append((N, A))  # Store the test case\n\n# Call the function with the number of test cases and the test cases\ncan_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases)\n```",
