## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mandarin chinese
, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

-----Output-----
Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le P \le 100,000$
- $2 \le S \le 30$
- $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
- in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$
Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a contest with multiple problems, each having several subtasks. Each subtask has a score and a number of contestants who solved it. We need to determine the difficulty of each problem based on how many times the number of contestants who solved a subtask is greater than the next subtask when the subtasks are sorted by score. The difficulty of a problem is represented as a pair of values: the count of such instances and the problem's index. Finally, we need to sort the problems based on their difficulty and output the indices of the problems in increasing order of difficulty.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Read the number of problems (P) and subtasks (S).
   - For each problem, read the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.
   - Pair the scores with the number of contestants and sort them based on scores.
   - Count how many times the number of contestants who solved a subtask is greater than the next subtask in the sorted list.
   - Store the count and the problem index as a tuple.
   - Sort all problems based on the count first and then by index.
   - Output the sorted indices.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Read P and S
   Initialize an empty list for difficulties
   For each problem from 1 to P:
       Read scores and number of contestants
       Pair scores with contestants and sort by scores
       Initialize count n to 0
       For k from 1 to S-1:
           If contestants[k-1] > contestants[k]:
               Increment n
       Append (n, problem_index) to difficulties
   Sort difficulties by first element (n) and then by second element (problem_index)
   For each difficulty in sorted difficulties:
       Print the problem_index
   ```

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mandarin chinese
, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

-----Output-----
Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le P \le 100,000$
- $2 \le S \le 30$
- $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
- in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

-----Subtasks-----

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host given the number of problems created by his setters, the number of problems required for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the number of days available to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for summation and list handling.

    The final implementation successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code was structured to first read input values, process each test case, and then output the results. Key strategies included using integer division to determine the number of contests and the `min` function to ensure the result did not exceed the available days. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of clear problem breakdown and efficient use of built-in functions in Python. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]
            A = case[3]
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))

    max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases)
    ```
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    The official solution is concise and effectively addresses the problem with minimal complexity. It follows a straightforward approach that can be distilled into a few key steps:

    1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it retrieves the values of N (number of setters), K (problems needed for a contest), and D (available days). It also reads the list of problems created by each setter.

    2. **Total Problems Calculation**: The solution calculates the total number of problems by summing the list A directly.

    3. **Contests Calculation**: It computes the number of possible contests by performing integer division of the total problems by K.

    4. **Final Output**: The result for each test case is the minimum of the number of possible contests and the number of days available, which is printed directly.

    The official solution is efficient, operating in O(N) time complexity for each test case due to the summation of the list, which is optimal given the constraints. My initial solution was similar in logic but included unnecessary unpacking and variable assignments that could be streamlined. 

    Overall, the official solution's brevity and clarity serve as a reminder of the importance of simplicity in coding, especially when the problem can be solved with straightforward arithmetic operations.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mandarin chinese
, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

-----Output-----
Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le P \le 100,000$
- $2 \le S \le 30$
- $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
- in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$
Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [prompt] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**:
   The problem involves determining the difficulty of several programming contest problems based on their subtasks. Each problem has a set of subtasks, each with a score and the number of contestants who solved it. The difficulty of a problem is defined by counting how many times the number of contestants who solved a subtask decreases as the score increases. We need to sort the problems based on their difficulty and output their indices in increasing order.

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] In this task, I was required to determine the difficulty of programming contest problems based on their subtasks. The key concept was to count how many times the number of contestants who solved a subtask decreases as the score increases. This required sorting the subtasks by score and then comparing the number of contestants.

The solution involved reading the number of problems and subtasks, processing each problem to pair scores with the number of contestants, and counting the valid indices where the number of contestants decreased. The results were stored as tuples and sorted based on difficulty before outputting the indices.

The final implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output requirements. The core strategy involved sorting and counting, which worked effectively given the constraints. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all tests, indicating that the approach was sound. 

Key code snippet:
```python
def calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems):
    difficulties = []
    for i in range(P):
        scores = problems[i][0]
        contestants = problems[i][1]
        paired = list(zip(scores, contestants))
        paired.sort()  # Sort by scores
        count = 0
        for k in range(1, S):
            if paired[k-1][1] > paired[k][1]:  # Compare number of contestants
                count += 1
        difficulties.append((count, i + 1))  # Store (count, problem index)
    
    difficulties.sort()  # Sort by (count, index)
    for difficulty in difficulties:
        print(difficulty[1])  # Output the problem index
``` 

This experience reinforced the importance of sorting and counting in algorithmic problem-solving, especially in competitive programming contexts.

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem by utilizing a dictionary to group problems based on their calculated difficulty scores. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:

1. **Input Handling**: The solution reads the number of problems and subtasks in a single line and initializes a dictionary to store the scores associated with each problem.

2. **Data Structuring**: For each problem, it reads the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask. It then creates a dictionary (`nsc`) that maps each score to its corresponding number of contestants. This allows for efficient lookups when comparing contestant numbers.

3. **Sorting and Counting**: The scores are sorted, and the solution iterates through the sorted scores to count how many times the number of contestants decreases as the score increases. This is done using a simple loop that compares adjacent scores.

4. **Grouping by Difficulty**: The solution uses a dictionary to group problem indices by their difficulty score. If a score already exists as a key, it appends the problem index to the list; otherwise, it creates a new entry.

5. **Final Sorting and Output**: After calculating the scores for all problems, it sorts the keys of the dictionary (the difficulty scores) and constructs a final list of problem indices in the correct order. Finally, it prints the indices.

### Key Takeaways:
- Using a dictionary to group problems by difficulty is an efficient way to manage and sort the results.
- Sorting the scores and using a loop to count decreases is straightforward and effective.
- The approach of separating the logic into clear steps (input handling, data structuring, counting, grouping, and output) enhances readability and maintainability.

This solution is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity, especially given the constraints of the problem. It avoids unnecessary complexity by leveraging Python's built-in data structures effectively.

[Problem]

    Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
    The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
    - Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
    - Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
    - Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
    - For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
    You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

    -----Output-----
    Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le P \le 100,000$
    - $2 \le S \le 30$
    - $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
    - $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
    - in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$
    Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

    -----Example Input-----
    3 3
    16 24 60
    498 861 589
