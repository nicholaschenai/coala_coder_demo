    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**:\n   The problem involves determining the difficulty of several programming contest problems based on their subtasks. Each problem has a set of subtasks, each with a score and the number of contestants who solved it. The difficulty of a problem is defined by counting how many times the number of contestants who solved a subtask decreases as the score increases. We need to sort the problems based on their difficulty and output their indices in increasing order.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**:\n   - Read the number of problems (P) and the number of subtasks (S).\n   - For each problem, read the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.\n   - Pair the scores with the number of contestants and sort them based on scores.\n   - Count the number of valid indices where the number of contestants decreases as the score increases.\n   - Store the difficulty as a tuple (count, problem index) for each problem.\n   - Sort the problems based on their difficulty and output the indices in the required order.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems):\n       difficulties = []\n       for i from 1 to P:\n           scores = problems[i][0]\n           contestants = problems[i][1]\n           paired = zip(scores, contestants)\n           sort paired by scores\n           count = 0\n           for k from 1 to S-1:\n               if contestants[k-1] > contestants[k]:\n                   count += 1\n           difficulties.append((count, i))\n       sort difficulties by (count, index)\n       for each difficulty in difficulties:\n           print difficulty[1]\n   \n   read P, S\n   problems = []\n   for i from 1 to P:\n       scores = read scores for problem i\n       contestants = read contestants for problem i\n       problems.append((scores, contestants))\n   calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems)\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems):\n    difficulties = []\n    for i in range(P):\n        scores = problems[i][0]\n        contestants = problems[i][1]\n        paired = list(zip(scores, contestants))\n        paired.sort()  # Sort by scores\n        count = 0\n        for k in range(1, S):\n            if paired[k-1][1] > paired[k][1]:  # Compare number of contestants\n                count += 1\n        difficulties.append((count, i + 1))  # Store (count, problem index)\n    \n    difficulties.sort()  # Sort by (count, index)\n    for difficulty in difficulties:\n        print(difficulty[1])  # Output the problem index\n\n# Read input\nP, S = map(int, input().split())\nproblems = []\nfor _ in range(P):\n    scores = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    contestants = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    problems.append((scores, contestants))\n\ncalculate_difficulty(P, S, problems)\n```",
