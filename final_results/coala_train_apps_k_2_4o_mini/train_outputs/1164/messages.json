Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).\nThe difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:\n- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.\n- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.\n- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.\n- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.\nYou should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.\n- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \\dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \\dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint $P$ lines containing one integer each \u2014 the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le P \\le 100,000$\n- $2 \\le S \\le 30$\n- $1 \\le SC_i \\le 100$ for each valid $i$\n- $1 \\le NS_i \\le 1,000$ for each valid $i$\n- in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$\nSubtask #2 (75 points): original constraints\n\n-----Example Input-----\n3 3\n16 24 60\n498 861 589\n14 24 62\n72 557 819\n16 15 69\n435 779 232\n\n-----Example Output-----\n2\n1\n3\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the number of days available to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for summation and list handling.\n\n    The final implementation successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code was structured to first read input values, process each test case, and then output the results. Key strategies included using integer division to determine the number of contests and the `min` function to ensure the result did not exceed the available days. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of clear problem breakdown and efficient use of built-in functions in Python. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n            A = case[3]\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))\n\n    max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution is concise and effectively addresses the problem with minimal complexity. It follows a straightforward approach that can be distilled into a few key steps:\n\n    1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it retrieves the values of N (number of setters), K (problems needed for a contest), and D (available days). It also reads the list of problems created by each setter.\n\n    2. **Total Problems Calculation**: The solution calculates the total number of problems by summing the list A directly.\n\n    3. **Contests Calculation**: It computes the number of possible contests by performing integer division of the total problems by K.\n\n    4. **Final Output**: The result for each test case is the minimum of the number of possible contests and the number of days available, which is printed directly.\n\n    The official solution is efficient, operating in O(N) time complexity for each test case due to the summation of the list, which is optimal given the constraints. My initial solution was similar in logic but included unnecessary unpacking and variable assignments that could be streamlined. \n\n    Overall, the official solution's brevity and clarity serve as a reminder of the importance of simplicity in coding, especially when the problem can be solved with straightforward arithmetic operations.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

It then creates a dictionary (`nsc`) that maps each score to its corresponding number of contestants. This allows for efficient lookups when comparing contestant numbers.\n\n3. **Sorting and Counting**: The scores are sorted, and the solution iterates through the sorted scores to count how many times the number of contestants decreases as the score increases. This is done using a simple loop that compares adjacent scores.\n\n4. **Grouping by Difficulty**: The solution uses a dictionary to group problem indices by their difficulty score. If a score already exists as a key, it appends the problem index to the list; otherwise, it creates a new entry.\n\n5. **Final Sorting and Output**: After calculating the scores for all problems, it sorts the keys of the dictionary (the difficulty scores) and constructs a final list of problem indices in the correct order.
