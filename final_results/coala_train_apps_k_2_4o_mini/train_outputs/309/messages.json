The solution utilized dynamic programming, which is a common approach for problems involving subsequences. The key concept was to maintain an array `d` where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. \n\n    The algorithm iterated through the input list, comparing each element with all previous elements to determine if they could form an increasing subsequence. If they could, the length was updated accordingly. The final result was obtained by finding the maximum value in the `d` array.\n\n    The implemented solution was efficient with a time complexity of O(n^2), which is acceptable for this problem size. The code was structured clearly, with comments explaining each step, making it easy to follow. The solution passed all tests, confirming its correctness.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n            n = len(nums)\n            if n == 0:\n                return 0\n            d = [1] * n\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                for j in range(i):\n                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n            return max(d)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of dynamic programming in solving subsequence-related problems and highlighted the effectiveness of a structured approach to coding.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved finding the length of the shortest contiguous subarray with a sum of at least K. The solution utilized a combination of prefix sums and a deque to efficiently track potential subarrays. The key concepts included maintaining a running sum and using a sliding window approach to dynamically adjust the size of the subarray while checking for the required sum.\n\n    The implemented strategy involved calculating prefix sums to facilitate quick sum calculations for any subarray. A deque was used to store indices of the prefix sums, allowing for efficient removal of elements that no longer contributed to valid subarrays. The algorithm successfully handled edge cases, such as when no valid subarray exists, by returning -1.\n\n    The final code was structured to ensure clarity and efficiency, and it passed all provided test cases. The approach demonstrated the effectiveness of using prefix sums and deques for problems involving subarray sums, which is a common pattern in competitive programming. \n\n    Here is the final solution for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def shortestSubarray(self, A: list[int], K: int) -> int:\n            from collections import deque\n        \n            n = len(A)\n            prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)\n        \n            # Calculate prefix sums\n            for i in range(n):\n                prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + A[i]\n        \n            min_length = float('inf')\n            dq = deque()\n        \n            for i in range(n + 1):\n                # Check if we can form a valid subarray\n                while dq and prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[dq[0]] >= K:\n                    min_length = min(min_length, i - dq.popleft())\n            \n                # Maintain the deque in increasing order of prefix sums\n                while dq and prefix_sum[i] <= prefix_sum[dq[-1]]:\n                    dq.pop()\n            \n                dq.append(i)\n        \n            return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This helps in quickly identifying the most common elements, which can be useful for determining potential subsequences.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: A 2D list `dp` is initialized to store the lengths of arithmetic subsequences. Each entry `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence that ends with the elements at indices `i` and `j`.\n\n3. **Index Mapping**: The solution maintains an `index` dictionary to keep track of the last seen index of each number. This allows for quick lookups when checking if a number that could form an arithmetic sequence exists.\n\n4. **Iterative Comparison**: The nested loops iterate through pairs of indices `(i, j)`, where `i < j`. For each pair, it calculates the potential previous number in the sequence (`b = 2 * a - c`). If `b` exists in the `index`, it updates the `dp` table accordingly.\n\n5. **Max Length Calculation**: The maximum length of the arithmetic subsequence is updated throughout the iterations, ensuring that the final result reflects the longest sequence found.\n\n### Reflection on My Approach:\n\nWhile my approach was conceptually sound and utilized dynamic programming, it lacked the efficiency of the official solution. The official solution's use of a direct calculation for potential previous elements and the maintenance of an index mapping allowed it to avoid unnecessary checks and streamline the process. Additionally, the use of a 2D list for `dp` was effective in capturing the relationships between pairs of indices, which I could have implemented more effectively.\n\nIn future implementations, I should consider leveraging counting and mapping techniques to optimize the search for potential subsequences, as demonstrated in the official solution."
