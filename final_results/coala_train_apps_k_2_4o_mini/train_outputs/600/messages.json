Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Precomputation of Last Digits**: The official solution precomputes the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers and stores them in a list `a`. This is based on the observation that the last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers due to properties of modular arithmetic.\n\n2. **Binary Representation for Index Calculation**: Instead of generating the last digits for all Fibonacci numbers up to N, the solution uses the binary representation of N to determine the effective index in the precomputed list. Specifically, it calculates the length of the binary representation of N, subtracts 3, and computes `2**temp` to find the corresponding index in the list of last digits.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: This approach is significantly more efficient, as it reduces the problem to a constant-time lookup after a one-time precomputation of the last digits. This is crucial given the constraints where N can be as large as \\(10^{18}\\).\n\n4. **Key Insight**: The realization that the last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 terms allows for a drastic reduction in the complexity of the problem. Instead of iterating through potentially billions of Fibonacci numbers, the solution leverages this periodicity.\n\nIn summary, the official solution's use of precomputation and properties of modular arithmetic allows it to handle the problem efficiently, while my initial approach would have been computationally infeasible for large values of N.
