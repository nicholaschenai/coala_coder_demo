## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
- Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
- If $l = 1$, the process ends.
- Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
- Change $D$ to $E$.
When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the last remaining number.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le N \le 10^{18}$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (20 points):
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le N \le 10^7$
Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
1
9

-----Example Output-----
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: The first $N$ Fibonacci numbers are $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)$. The sequence $D$ is $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1) \rightarrow (1, 2, 5, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (3)$.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the last remaining number from a sequence derived from the last digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers. The process involves repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements from the sequence until only one number remains.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - First, we need to compute the last digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers. However, since N can be as large as 10^18, we cannot compute all Fibonacci numbers directly.
   - We can observe that the last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers due to a property known as Pisano period. Therefore, we only need to compute the last digits for the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
   - Once we have the last digits, we can simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one number remains. This can be done efficiently by using the properties of binary representation, as the last remaining index can be derived from the highest power of 2 less than or equal to N.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function last_remaining_fibonacci_digit(N):
       # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
       last_digits = [0, 1]
       for i from 2 to 59:
           last_digits[i] = (last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10
       
       # Find the effective index in the last_digits array
       effective_index = (N - 1) % 60
       
       # Return the last digit corresponding to the effective index
       return last_digits[effective_index]

        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
           The task is to find the N'th number in a specific series defined as 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, etc. The input consists of multiple test cases, each specifying a value of N, and the output should be the corresponding number from the series for each test case.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
           To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or formula that generates the series. By observing the series, we can derive that the N'th term can be calculated using a specific formula. We will read the number of test cases, then for each test case, compute the N'th term using the derived formula and print the results.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function calculate_series(N):

           read T  # number of test cases
           for each test case from 1 to T:
               read N
               result = calculate_series(N - 1)  # N - 1 because series is 0-indexed

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th term in a specific series defined as 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, etc. Initially, I misidentified the formula for generating the series, leading to incorrect outputs. The series is based on the sum of squares of the first (N-1) integers, which I failed to recognize at first.

    The correct approach involves calculating the sum of squares up to (N-1). The formula for the N'th term can be derived as follows: T(N) = sum(i^2) for i from 0 to N-1. This realization led to the correct implementation of the function.

    The final working code correctly computes the N'th term using a loop to sum the squares:

    ```python
    def calculate_series(N):
        sum_of_squares = 0
        for i in range(N):
            sum_of_squares += i * i
        return sum_of_squares

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        result = calculate_series(N)
        print(result)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing the series and recognizing patterns, as well as the need to validate the derived formulas against sample outputs.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
- Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
- If $l = 1$, the process ends.
- Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
- Change $D$ to $E$.
When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the last remaining number.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing all odd-indexed elements from a sequence of the last decimal digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The input consists of multiple test cases, each specifying a value of N, and the output should be the last remaining number for each test case.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we need to:
   - Generate the last decimal digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers.
   - Repeatedly remove the odd-indexed elements from this sequence until only one element remains.
   - Return that last remaining element for each test case. 
   Given the constraints (with N being as large as 10^18), we cannot generate all Fibonacci numbers directly. Instead, we can use properties of the Fibonacci sequence and modular arithmetic to find the last digit efficiently.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to find the last remaining number after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements from a sequence of the last decimal digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers. The challenge was to handle very large values of N (up to 10^18) efficiently without generating all Fibonacci numbers directly.

The core concept involved calculating the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using an iterative approach, which is efficient and avoids overflow issues. The sequence of last digits was generated, and a while loop was used to repeatedly filter out odd-indexed elements until only one remained.

The final solution successfully implemented this logic, and the code passed the provided test cases. Key strategies included leveraging modular arithmetic to keep calculations manageable and using list slicing to efficiently filter the sequence. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of optimizing for large inputs and understanding the properties of sequences like Fibonacci.

    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

 temp = 2**temp
 temp = temp%60
 
 print(a[temp])

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] The official solution provides a more efficient approach to solving the problem than my initial attempt. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Precomputation of Last Digits**: The official solution precomputes the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers and stores them in a list `a`. This is based on the observation that the last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers due to properties of modular arithmetic.

2. **Binary Representation for Index Calculation**: Instead of generating the last digits for all Fibonacci numbers up to N, the solution uses the binary representation of N to determine the effective index in the precomputed list. Specifically, it calculates the length of the binary representation of N, subtracts 3, and computes `2**temp` to find the corresponding index in the list of last digits.

3. **Efficiency**: This approach is significantly more efficient, as it reduces the problem to a constant-time lookup after a one-time precomputation of the last digits. This is crucial given the constraints where N can be as large as \(10^{18}\).

4. **Key Insight**: The realization that the last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 terms allows for a drastic reduction in the complexity of the problem. Instead of iterating through potentially billions of Fibonacci numbers, the solution leverages this periodicity.

In summary, the official solution's use of precomputation and properties of modular arithmetic allows it to handle the problem efficiently, while my initial approach would have been computationally infeasible for large values of N. This experience highlights the importance of recognizing patterns and properties in mathematical sequences to optimize solutions.
