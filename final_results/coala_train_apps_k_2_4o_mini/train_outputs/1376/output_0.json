    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   Salmon has a number of rubber ducks of different colors and wants to organize them into boxes. Each box can hold a specific number of ducks, and he wants to ensure that each box contains at most two different colors of ducks. The task is to determine how to distribute the ducks into the boxes according to these rules.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - For each test case, read the number of colors and the number of ducks each box can hold.\n   - Count how many ducks there are of each color.\n   - Start filling the boxes with ducks, ensuring that no box has more than two colors.\n   - If a box is filled with one color, the second color should be set to zero.\n   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read N, K\n           read duck_counts\n           initialize boxes as empty list\n           for i from 0 to N-1:\n               if there are ducks of color 0:\n                   fill box with color 0 ducks\n                   if box is not full:\n                       fill remaining space with color 1 ducks\n               else:\n                   fill box with color 1 ducks\n                   if box is not full:\n                       fill remaining space with color 0 ducks\n               add filled box to boxes\n           output boxes\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N, K = case[0], case[1]\n        duck_counts = case[2]\n        \n        # Initialize a list to store the results for each box\n        boxes = []\n        \n        # We will use a pointer to track which color we are using\n        color_index = 0\n        \n        # While we have boxes to fill\n        for i in range(N):\n            # Initialize counts for the current box\n            m1, m2 = 0, 0\n            c1, c2 = -1, -1\n            \n            # Fill the box with ducks\n            while m1 + m2 < K:\n                # If we can still add ducks of the current color\n                if duck_counts[color_index] > 0:\n                    # Determine how many we can take\n                    take = min(K - (m1 + m2), duck_counts[color_index])\n                    if m1 == 0:\n                        c1 = color_index\n                        m1 = take\n                    else:\n                        c2 = color_index\n                        m2 = take\n                    # Decrease the count of ducks of this color\n                    duck_counts[color_index] -= take\n                \n                # Move to the next color\n                color_index = (color_index + 1) % (N + 1)\n                \n                # If we have cycled through all colors, break\n                if color_index == 0:\n                    break\n            \n            # Append the result for the current box\n            boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))\n        \n        # Output the results for the current test case\n        for box in boxes:\n            print(box[0], box[1], box[2], box[3])\n\n# Read input\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    duck_counts = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    test_cases.append((N, K, duck_counts))\n\n# Call the function to distribute ducks\ndistribute_ducks(T, test_cases)\n```",
