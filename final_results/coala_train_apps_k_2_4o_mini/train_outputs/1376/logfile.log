## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Salmon has a number of rubber ducks of different colors and wants to organize them into boxes. Each box can hold a specific number of ducks, and he wants to ensure that each box contains at most two different colors of ducks. The task is to determine how to distribute the ducks into the boxes while adhering to these constraints.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of duck colors and their counts. We will fill each box with ducks, ensuring that we do not exceed the box capacity and that we only use up to two colors per box. We can keep track of how many ducks of each color we have left and fill the boxes accordingly. If we run out of ducks of one color, we can continue filling the box with the remaining color.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, K
           read duck_counts
           initialize an empty list for boxes
           for i from 0 to N-1:
               initialize box with (0, 0, 0, 0) for colors and counts
               fill the box with ducks:
                   while box is not full:
                       if there are ducks of color 0:
                           add ducks of color 0 to box
                       if there are ducks of color 1:
                           add ducks of color 1 to box
                       continue until the box is full or no ducks left
               add filled box to boxes
           output boxes

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host given the number of problems created by his setters, the number of problems required for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the number of days available to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for summation and list handling.

    The final implementation successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code was structured to first read input values, process each test case, and then output the results. Key strategies included using integer division to determine the number of contests and the `min` function to ensure the result did not exceed the available days. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of clear problem breakdown and efficient use of built-in functions in Python. 

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]
            A = case[3]
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))

    max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases)
    ```
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute exactly \( K \) amount of money to \( N \) minions based on their individual demands. The key points to consider were whether the total demand from the minions matched \( K \), was less than \( K \), or exceeded \( K \).

    Initially, the approach focused on checking if the total demand equaled \( K \) and incorrectly assumed that if the total demand was less than \( K \), Gru could always distribute the remaining money. This led to incorrect outputs, particularly in cases where the remaining money could not be distributed without exceeding individual demands.

    The correct logic should have been:
    1. If the total demand equals \( K \), print "YES".
    2. If the total demand is less than \( K \), print "YES" since Gru can distribute the remaining money.
    3. If the total demand exceeds \( K \), print "NO".

    Despite multiple attempts to refine the logic, the solution consistently failed to account for the distribution constraints properly. The final code snippet aimed to address these issues but still produced incorrect results, indicating a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.

    ### Key Takeaways:
    - Ensure to fully understand the constraints of distribution when dealing with remaining amounts.
    - Always validate the logic against edge cases to ensure correctness.
    - The problem highlighted the importance of careful condition checking in scenarios involving sums and distributions. 

    ### Final Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            K = case[1]
            demands = case[2]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
        
            if total_demand == K:
                print("YES")
            elif total_demand < K:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        demands = list(map(int, input().split()))

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Salmon has a number of rubber ducks of different colors and wants to organize them into boxes. Each box can hold a specific number of ducks, and he wants to ensure that each box contains at most two different colors of ducks. The task is to determine how to distribute the ducks into the boxes according to these rules.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each test case, read the number of colors and the number of ducks each box can hold.
   - Count how many ducks there are of each color.
   - Start filling the boxes with ducks, ensuring that no box has more than two colors.
   - If a box is filled with one color, the second color should be set to zero.
   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, K
           read duck_counts

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Salmon has a number of rubber ducks of different colors and wants to organize them into boxes. Each box can hold a specific number of ducks, and he wants to ensure that each box contains at most two different colors of ducks. The task is to determine how to distribute the ducks into the boxes according to these rules.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each test case, read the number of colors and the number of ducks each box can hold.
   - Count how many ducks there are of each color.
   - Start filling the boxes with ducks, ensuring that no box has more than two colors.
   - If a box is filled with one color, the second color should be set to zero.
   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, K
           read duck_counts
           initialize boxes as empty list
           for i from 0 to N-1:
               if there are ducks of color 0:
                   fill box with color 0 ducks
                   if box is not full:
                       fill remaining space with color 1 ducks

                   if box is not full:
                       fill remaining space with color 0 ducks

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [generation text] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements:**
   - Each box can hold exactly `K` ducks.
   - Each box can contain at most 2 distinct colors.
   - If a box contains only one color, the second color should be represented as `0` with its count also being `0`.

2. **Identifying the Issues in the Code:**
   - The code attempts to fill boxes by cycling through colors, but it does not ensure that the total number of ducks in each box equals `K`.
   - The logic for filling boxes does not correctly handle the case where a box might need to be filled with two colors, especially when one color runs out.
   - The output format does not adhere to the requirement of having valid color indices (0 to N) and counts (0 to K).

3. **Where I Went Wrong:**
   - The color index cycling logic is flawed. It does not properly check if the current color has ducks available before trying to fill the box.
   - The logic for filling the box does not correctly account for the situation where one color might be exhausted while trying to fill the box.
   - The output format is incorrect, as it can include invalid color indices (like -1) and does not ensure that the counts add up to `K`.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Fill Boxes with Two Colors:**
   - Start with the first color and fill as much as possible until it runs out or the box is full.
   - If the box is not full, switch to the next available color and fill the remaining space.
   - Ensure that the counts in each box add up to `K`.

2. **Output the Results:**
   - Ensure that the output format is correct, with valid color indices and counts.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Salmon has a number of rubber ducks of different colors and wants to organize them into boxes. Each box can hold a specific number of ducks, and he wants to ensure that each box contains at most two different colors of ducks. The task is to determine how to distribute the ducks into the boxes according to these rules.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each test case, read the number of colors and the number of ducks each box can hold.
   - Count how many ducks there are of each color.
   - Start filling the boxes with ducks, ensuring that no box has more than two colors.
   - If a box is filled with one color, the second color should be set to zero.
   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, K

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements:**
   - Each box can hold exactly `K` ducks.
   - Each box can contain at most 2 distinct colors.
   - If a box contains only one color, the second color should be represented as `0` with its count also being `0`.

2. **Identifying the Issues in the Code:**
   - The code attempts to fill boxes by cycling through colors, but it does not ensure that the total number of ducks in each box equals `K`.
   - The logic for filling boxes does not correctly handle the case where a box might need to be filled with two colors, especially when one color runs out.
   - The output format does not adhere to the requirement of having valid color indices (0 to N) and counts (0 to K).

3. **Where I Went Wrong:**
   - The color index cycling logic is flawed. It does not properly check if the current color has ducks available before trying to fill the box.
   - The logic for filling the box does not correctly account for the situation where one color might be exhausted while trying to fill the box.
   - The output format is incorrect, as it can include invalid color indices (like -1) and does not ensure that the counts add up to `K`.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Fill Boxes with Two Colors:**
   - Start with the first color and fill as much as possible until it runs out or the box is full.
   - If the box is not full, switch to the next available color and fill the remaining space.
   - Ensure that the counts in each box add up to `K`.

2. **Output the Results:**
   - Ensure that the output format is correct, with valid color indices and counts.

### Revised Pseudocode:
```
function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N, K

        for i from 0 to N-1:
            initialize m1, m2, c1, c2 to 0
            for color_index from 0 to N:
                if duck_counts[color_index] > 0:
                    if m1 == 0:
                        c1 = color_index
                        m1 = min(duck_counts[color_index], K)

            add (c1, m1, c2, m2) to boxes

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute exactly \( K \) amount of money to \( N \) minions based on their individual demands. The key points to consider were whether the total demand from the minions matched \( K \), was less than \( K \), or exceeded \( K \).

    Initially, the approach focused on checking if the total demand equaled \( K \) and incorrectly assumed that if the total demand was less than \( K \), Gru could always distribute the remaining money. This led to incorrect outputs, particularly in cases where the remaining money could not be distributed without exceeding individual demands.

    The correct logic should have been:
    1. If the total demand equals \( K \), print "YES".
    2. If the total demand is less than \( K \), print "YES" since Gru can distribute the remaining money.
    3. If the total demand exceeds \( K \), print "NO".

    Despite multiple attempts to refine the logic, the solution consistently failed to account for the distribution constraints properly. The final code snippet aimed to address these issues but still produced incorrect results, indicating a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.

    ### Key Takeaways:
    - Ensure to fully understand the constraints of distribution when dealing with remaining amounts.
    - Always validate the logic against edge cases to ensure correctness.
    - The problem highlighted the importance of careful condition checking in scenarios involving sums and distributions. 

    ### Final Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            K = case[1]
            demands = case[2]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
        
            if total_demand == K:
                print("YES")
            elif total_demand < K:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host given the number of problems created by his setters, the number of problems required for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the number of days available to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for summation and list handling.

    The final implementation successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code was structured to first read input values, process each test case, and then output the results. Key strategies included using integer division to determine the number of contests and the `min` function to ensure the result did not exceed the available days. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of clear problem breakdown and efficient use of built-in functions in Python. 

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]
            A = case[3]
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Salmon has a number of rubber ducks of different colors and wants to organize them into boxes. Each box can hold a specific number of ducks, and he wants to ensure that each box contains at most two different colors of ducks. The task is to determine how to distribute the ducks into the boxes according to these rules.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each test case, read the number of colors and the number of ducks each box can hold.
   - Count how many ducks there are of each color.
   - Start filling the boxes with ducks, ensuring that no box has more than two colors.
   - If a box is filled with one color, the second color should be set to zero.
   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements:**
   - Each box can hold exactly `K` ducks.
   - Each box can contain at most 2 distinct colors.
   - If a box contains only one color, the second color should be represented as `0` with its count also being `0`.

2. **Identifying the Issues in the Code:**
   - The code attempts to fill boxes by cycling through colors, but it does not ensure that the total number of ducks in each box equals `K`.
   - The logic for filling boxes does not correctly handle the case where a box might need to be filled with two colors, especially when one color runs out.
   - The output format does not adhere to the requirement of having valid color indices (0 to N) and counts (0 to K).

3. **Where I Went Wrong:**
   - The color index cycling logic is flawed. It does not properly check if the current color has ducks available before trying to fill the box.
   - The logic for filling the box does not correctly account for the situation where one color might be exhausted while trying to fill the box.
   - The output format is incorrect, as it can include invalid color indices (like -1) and does not ensure that the counts add up to `K`.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Fill Boxes with Two Colors:**
   - Start with the first color and fill as much as possible until it runs out or the box is full.
   - If the box is not full, switch to the next available color and fill the remaining space.
   - Ensure that the counts in each box add up to `K`.

2. **Output the Results:**
   - Ensure that the output format is correct, with valid color indices and counts.

### Revised Pseudocode:
```
function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N, K
        read duck_counts
        initialize boxes as empty list
        for i from 0 to N-1:
            initialize m1, m2, c1, c2 to 0
            for color_index from 0 to N:
                if duck_counts[color_index] > 0:
                    if m1 == 0:
                        c1 = color_index
                        m1 = min(duck_counts[color_index], K)
                        duck_counts[color_index] -= m1
                    else:
                        c2 = color_index
                        m2 = min(duck_counts[color_index], K - m1)
                        duck_counts[color_index] -= m2
                    if m1 + m2 == K:
                        break
            add (c1, m1, c2, m2) to boxes
        output boxes
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Box Filling Logic:** The logic now correctly fills each box with ducks from the available colors, ensuring that the total count in each box equals `K`.
2. **Output Format:** The output format is corrected to ensure valid color indices and counts.
3. **Handling Single Color Cases:** The code now properly handles cases where only one color is available to fill the box.

This code should now correctly solve the problem as specified.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to distribute rubber ducks of various colors into boxes while adhering to specific constraints: each box can hold exactly `K` ducks and can contain at most two distinct colors. The challenge involved ensuring that the distribution was valid and that the output format met the requirements.

Initially, the approach involved cycling through colors and attempting to fill boxes, but this led to issues with not properly filling boxes to the required count of `K` and producing invalid color indices. The key realization was that the filling logic needed to ensure that each box was filled correctly, accounting for the possibility of running out of ducks of a particular color.

The final solution involved iterating through the available colors and filling each box with ducks until it reached the required count. If only one color was available, the second color was set to zero, ensuring the output format was correct. This approach successfully passed all test cases.

Key takeaways:
- Ensure that the filling logic accounts for the total count required in each box.
- Maintain valid color indices and counts in the output.
- Handle edge cases where only one color is available to fill a box.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Salmon has a number of rubber ducks of different colors and wants to organize them into boxes. Each box can hold a specific number of ducks, and he wants to ensure that each box contains at most two different colors of ducks. The task is to determine how to distribute the ducks into the boxes according to these rules.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each test case, read the number of colors and the number of ducks each box can hold.
   - Count how many ducks there are of each color.
   - Start filling the boxes with ducks, ensuring that no box has more than two colors.
   - If a box is filled with one color, the second color should be set to zero.
   - Continue this process until all ducks are placed in boxes.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, K

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements:**
   - Each box can hold exactly `K` ducks.
   - Each box can contain at most 2 distinct colors.
   - If a box contains only one color, the second color should be represented as `0` with its count also being `0`.

2. **Identifying the Issues in the Code:**
   - The code attempts to fill boxes by cycling through colors, but it does not ensure that the total number of ducks in each box equals `K`.
   - The logic for filling boxes does not correctly handle the case where a box might need to be filled with two colors, especially when one color runs out.
   - The output format does not adhere to the requirement of having valid color indices (0 to N) and counts (0 to K).

3. **Where I Went Wrong:**
   - The color index cycling logic is flawed. It does not properly check if the current color has ducks available before trying to fill the box.
   - The logic for filling the box does not correctly account for the situation where one color might be exhausted while trying to fill the box.
   - The output format is incorrect, as it can include invalid color indices (like -1) and does not ensure that the counts add up to `K`.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Fill Boxes with Two Colors:**
   - Start with the first color and fill as much as possible until it runs out or the box is full.
   - If the box is not full, switch to the next available color and fill the remaining space.
   - Ensure that the counts in each box add up to `K`.

2. **Output the Results:**
   - Ensure that the output format is correct, with valid color indices and counts.

### Revised Pseudocode:
```
function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read N, K
        read duck_counts
        initialize boxes as empty list
        for i from 0 to N-1:
            initialize m1, m2, c1, c2 to 0
            for color_index from 0 to N:
                if duck_counts[color_index] > 0:
                    if m1 == 0:
                        c1 = color_index
                        m1 = min(duck_counts[color_index], K)
                        duck_counts[color_index] -= m1
                    else:
                        c2 = color_index
                        m2 = min(duck_counts[color_index], K - m1)
                        duck_counts[color_index] -= m2
                    if m1 + m2 == K:
                        break
            add (c1, m1, c2, m2) to boxes
        output boxes
```

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [generation text] In reflecting on my attempts to solve the problem of distributing rubber ducks into boxes, I learned several key insights that can be useful for future problem-solving:

1. **Understanding Constraints and Requirements:**
   The problem required careful attention to constraints, specifically that each box must contain exactly `K` ducks and can have at most two distinct colors. My initial approach did not adequately ensure that the total count in each box was exactly `K`, which led to incorrect outputs.

2. **Iterative Filling Logic:**
   The official solution employs a systematic approach to fill boxes iteratively. It uses a nested loop to check combinations of colors and their counts, ensuring that the boxes are filled correctly. This method is effective because it directly addresses the requirement of filling boxes while managing the counts of available ducks.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   The official solution includes specific handling for edge cases, such as when there are only two colors or when one color runs out. This is crucial for ensuring that the solution is robust and can handle all possible inputs as specified in the problem.

4. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   The official solution appears to be efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. It uses a dictionary to map colors to their indices, which simplifies the process of outputting the results. This is a good practice for maintaining clarity and efficiency in the code.

5. **Key Code Snippets:**
   - The use of a dictionary to track indices of colors:
     ```python
     d=dict()
     for i in range(len(c)):
         for j in range(len(c1)):
             if(c[i]==c1[j]):
                 d[i]=j
                 c1[j]=-1
                 break
     ```
   - The iterative filling of boxes:
     ```python
     while(m<n):
         if (i==n):
             print(d[n],k,d[n-1],0)
             c[n]-=k
             m+=1
         ...
     ```

Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering problem constraints, employing systematic approaches to filling requirements, and handling edge cases effectively. The official solution provided a clear and efficient method for solving the problem, which I can reference in future similar challenges.

[Problem]
    Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
    Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
    Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
    Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

    It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

    If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

    -----Input:-----
    - The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
    - The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
    - The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

    -----Output:-----
    - Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
    - The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
    - Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
    - The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $T=10$
    - $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
    - $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
    - Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
    - There can be a color with $0$ ducks

    -----Subtasks-----
    - Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
    - Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
    - Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

    -----Sample Input:-----
    1
    2 4
    3 4 1

    -----Sample Output:-----
    2 1 1 3
    1 1 0 3

    -----Explanation:-----
    - In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
    - The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
    - Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.
