One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.\nEach rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.\nSalmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.\nPlease help Salmon achieve this goal!\n\nIt can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.\n\nIf there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   \n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   \n- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   \n- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \\leq i \\leq N$\n\n-----Output:-----\n- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. \n- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \\leq m1,m2 \\leq K$ and $0 \\leq c1,c2 \\leq N$. \n- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \\leq c1,c2 \\leq N$.\n- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $T=10$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$ \n- $2 \\leq K \\leq 10^5$ \n- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$\n- There can be a color with $0$ ducks\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \\leq N \\leq 10$, $K=2$ \n- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$\n- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n1\n2 4\n3 4 1\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n2 1 1 3\n1 1 0 3\n\n-----Explanation:-----\n- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   \n- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   \n- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Each box can hold a specific number of ducks, and he wants to ensure that each box contains at most two different colors of ducks. The task is to determine how to distribute the ducks into the boxes while adhering to these constraints.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of duck colors and their counts. We will fill each box with ducks, ensuring that we do not exceed the box capacity and that we only use up to two colors per box. We can keep track of how many ducks of each color we have left and fill the boxes accordingly. If we run out of ducks of one color, we can continue filling the box with the remaining color.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read N, K\n           read duck_counts\n           initialize an empty list for boxes\n           for i from 0 to N-1:\n               initialize box with (0, 0, 0, 0) for colors and counts\n               fill the box with ducks:\n                   while box is not full:\n                       if there are ducks of color 0:\n                           add ducks of color 0 to box\n                       if there are ducks of color 1:\n                           add ducks of color 1 to box\n                       continue until the box is full or no ducks left\n               add filled box to boxes\n           output boxes\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N, K = case[0]\n        duck_counts = case[1]\n        \n        # Initialize a list to hold the output for each box\n        boxes = []\n        \n        # We will use two pointers to manage the colors\n        color_index = 0\n        \n        # While we have boxes to fill\n        for i in range(N):\n            m1, m2 = 0, 0  # Counts of ducks in the current box\n            c1, c2 = -1, -1  # Colors in the current box\n            \n            # Fill the box until it reaches capacity K\n            while m1 + m2 < K:\n                # If we can add ducks of the current color\n                if duck_counts[color_index] > 0:\n                    if c1 == -1:  # If no color has been added yet\n                        c1 = color_index\n                        ducks_to_add = min(K - (m1 + m2), duck_counts[color_index])\n                        m1 += ducks_to_add\n                        duck_counts[color_index] -= ducks_to_add\n                    elif c2 == -1:  # If we can add a second color\n                        c2 = color_index\n                        ducks_to_add = min(K - (m1 + m2), duck_counts[color_index])\n                        m2 += ducks_to_add\n                        duck_counts[color_index] -= ducks_to_add\n                # Move to the next color\n                color_index += 1\n                if color_index >= len(duck_counts):\n                    break\n            \n            # Append the result for the current box\n            boxes.append((c1, m1, c2 if c2 != -1 else 0, m2))\n        \n        # Output the results for the current test case\n        for box in boxes:\n            print(box[0], box[1], box[2], box[3])\n\n# Read input and call the function\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    duck_counts = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    test_cases.append(((N, K), duck_counts))\n\ndistribute_ducks(T, test_cases)\n```"

The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the number of days available to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for summation and list handling.\n\n    The final implementation successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code was structured to first read input values, process each test case, and then output the results. Key strategies included using integer division to determine the number of contests and the `min` function to ensure the result did not exceed the available days. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of clear problem breakdown and efficient use of built-in functions in Python. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n            A = case[3]\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))\n\n    max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute exactly \\( K \\) amount of money to \\( N \\) minions based on their individual demands. The key points to consider were whether the total demand from the minions matched \\( K \\), was less than \\( K \\), or exceeded \\( K \\).\n\n    Initially, the approach focused on checking if the total demand equaled \\( K \\) and incorrectly assumed that if the total demand was less than \\( K \\), Gru could always distribute the remaining money. This led to incorrect outputs, particularly in cases where the remaining money could not be distributed without exceeding individual demands.\n\n    The correct logic should have been:\n    1. If the total demand equals \\( K \\), print \"YES\".\n    2. If the total demand is less than \\( K \\), print \"YES\" since Gru can distribute the remaining money.\n    3. If the total demand exceeds \\( K \\), print \"NO\".\n\n    Despite multiple attempts to refine the logic, the solution consistently failed to account for the distribution constraints properly. The final code snippet aimed to address these issues but still produced incorrect results, indicating a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.\n\n    ### Key Takeaways:\n    - Ensure to fully understand the constraints of distribution when dealing with remaining amounts.\n    - Always validate the logic against edge cases to ensure correctness.\n    - The problem highlighted the importance of careful condition checking in scenarios involving sums and distributions. \n\n    ### Final Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            K = case[1]\n            demands = case[2]\n            total_demand = sum(demands)\n        \n            if total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            elif total_demand < K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        demands = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, demands))\n\n    can_distribute_money(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the core concepts, strategies attempted, and the errors encountered during the problem-solving process.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

It does not properly check if the current color has ducks available before trying to fill the box.\n   - The logic for filling the box does not correctly account for the situation where one color might be exhausted while trying to fill the box.\n   - The output format is incorrect, as it can include invalid color indices (like -1) and does not ensure that the counts add up to `K`.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. **Fill Boxes with Two Colors:**\n   - Start with the first color and fill as much as possible until it runs out or the box is full.\n   - If the box is not full, switch to the next available color and fill the remaining space.\n   - Ensure that the counts in each box add up to `K`.\n\n2. **Output the Results:**\n   - Ensure that the output format is correct, with valid color indices and counts.\n\n### Revised Pseudocode:\n```\nfunction distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        read N, K\n        read duck_counts\n        initialize boxes as empty list\n        for i from 0 to N-1:\n            initialize m1, m2, c1, c2 to 0\n            for color_index from 0 to N:\n                if duck_counts[color_index] > 0:\n                    if m1 == 0:\n                        c1 = color_index\n                        m1 = min(duck_counts[color_index], K)\n                        duck_counts[color_index] -= m1\n                    else:\n                        c2 = color_index\n                        m2 = min(duck_counts[color_index], K - m1)\n                        duck_counts[color_index] -= m2\n                    if m1 + m2 == K:\n                        break\n            add (c1, m1, c2, m2) to boxes\n        output boxes\n```\n\n### Final Python 3 Solution:\n```python\ndef distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N, K = case[0], case[1]\n        duck_counts = case[2]\n        \n        # Initialize a list to store the results for each box\n        boxes = []\n        \n        # Fill each box\n        for i in range(N):\n            m1, m2 = 0, 0\n            c1, c2 = -1, -1\n            \n            # Try to fill the box with ducks\n            for color_index in range(N + 1):\n                if duck_counts[color_index] > 0:\n                    if m1 == 0:\n                        c1 = color_index\n                        m1 = min(duck_counts[color_index], K)\n                        duck_counts[color_index] -= m1\n                    else:\n                        c2 = color_index\n                        m2 = min(duck_counts[color_index], K - m1)\n                        duck_counts[color_index] -= m2\n                    if m1 + m2 >= K:\n                        break\n            \n            # Ensure we have valid counts\n            if m1 + m2 < K:\n                if m1 == 0:\n                    c1, m1 = c2, 0  # If we only have one color, set the second to zero\n                    m2 = K  # Fill the rest with the second color\n                else:\n                    m2 = K - m1  # Fill the rest with the second color\n            \n            # Append the result for the current box\n            boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))\n        \n        # Output the results for the current test case\n        for box in boxes:\n            print(box[0], box[1], box[2], box[3])\n\n# Read input\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    duck_counts = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    test_cases.append((N, K, duck_counts))\n\n# Call the function to distribute ducks\ndistribute_ducks(T, test_cases)\n```"

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute exactly \\( K \\) amount of money to \\( N \\) minions based on their individual demands. The key points to consider were whether the total demand from the minions matched \\( K \\), was less than \\( K \\), or exceeded \\( K \\).\n\n    Initially, the approach focused on checking if the total demand equaled \\( K \\) and incorrectly assumed that if the total demand was less than \\( K \\), Gru could always distribute the remaining money. This led to incorrect outputs, particularly in cases where the remaining money could not be distributed without exceeding individual demands.\n\n    The correct logic should have been:\n    1. If the total demand equals \\( K \\), print \"YES\".\n    2. If the total demand is less than \\( K \\), print \"YES\" since Gru can distribute the remaining money.\n    3. If the total demand exceeds \\( K \\), print \"NO\".\n\n    Despite multiple attempts to refine the logic, the solution consistently failed to account for the distribution constraints properly. The final code snippet aimed to address these issues but still produced incorrect results, indicating a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.\n\n    ### Key Takeaways:\n    - Ensure to fully understand the constraints of distribution when dealing with remaining amounts.\n    - Always validate the logic against edge cases to ensure correctness.\n    - The problem highlighted the importance of careful condition checking in scenarios involving sums and distributions. \n\n    ### Final Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            K = case[1]\n            demands = case[2]\n            total_demand = sum(demands)\n        \n            if total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            elif total_demand < K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        demands = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, demands))\n\n    can_distribute_money(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the core concepts, strategies attempted, and the errors encountered during the problem-solving process.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host given the number of problems created by his setters, the number of problems required for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the number of days available to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for summation and list handling.\n\n    The final implementation successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code was structured to first read input values, process each test case, and then output the results. Key strategies included using integer division to determine the number of contests and the `min` function to ensure the result did not exceed the available days. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of clear problem breakdown and efficient use of built-in functions in Python. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n            A = case[3]\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))\n\n    max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"

My initial approach did not adequately ensure that the total count in each box was exactly `K`, which led to incorrect outputs.\n\n2. **Iterative Filling Logic:**\n   The official solution employs a systematic approach to fill boxes iteratively.

This can apply to various real-world situations, such as organizing inventory in warehouses, packing items for shipping, or even in programming challenges that involve resource allocation. Understanding how to manage constraints while ensuring all items are accounted for is a valuable skill in logistics and operations management."
