    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The problem involves a game played between two players: you and the Grinch. You start with an integer \\( N \\). On your turn, you can either subtract 1 from \\( N \\) (if \\( N \\) is greater than 1) or divide \\( N \\) by any of its odd divisors greater than 1. The player who cannot make a move loses the game. You always play first, and the task is to determine who will win for multiple test cases.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To determine the winner, we need to analyze the possible moves for each player. If \\( N \\) is 1, the first player (you) cannot make a move and loses. If \\( N \\) is 2, you can subtract 1 to make it 1, and the Grinch will lose. For larger values of \\( N \\), we can use a strategy based on the parity (odd/even) of \\( N \\) and the available moves. The key observation is that if \\( N \\) is odd, you can always make it even for the Grinch, and if \\( N \\) is even, the Grinch can respond in a way that keeps the game in his favor.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function determine_winner(N):\n       if N == 1:\n           return \"Grinch\"\n       if N is even:\n           return \"Grinch\"\n       else:\n           return \"Me\"\n\n   read T\n   for each test case:\n       read N\n       result = determine_winner(N)\n       print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef determine_winner(N):\n    # If N is 1, the first player (you) cannot make a move and loses\n    if N == 1:\n        return \"Grinch\"\n    # If N is even, the Grinch can always respond to keep the game in his favor\n    if N % 2 == 0:\n        return \"Grinch\"\n    # If N is odd, the first player (you) can make it even for the Grinch\n    else:\n        return \"Me\"\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    # Read the value of N for each test case\n    N = int(input())\n    # Determine the winner and print the result\n    result = determine_winner(N)\n    print(result)\n```",
