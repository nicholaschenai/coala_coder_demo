    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   We have a line of students represented by a string where 'b' stands for boys and 'g' stands for girls. The goal is to rearrange the students in such a way that the total awkwardness, defined as the sum of distances between each boy and girl, is minimized. The distance between two students is the absolute difference of their positions in the line.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To minimize awkwardness, we should group all boys together and all girls together. This way, the distance between boys and girls is minimized. The optimal arrangement would be either all boys followed by all girls or all girls followed by all boys. We can calculate the awkwardness for both arrangements and choose the smaller one.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s):\n       count_b = count of 'b' in s\n       count_g = count of 'g' in s\n       \n       # Calculate awkwardness for arrangement \"bb...bgg...g\"\n       awkwardness_b_first = 0\n       for i from 0 to count_b - 1:\n           for j from count_b to count_b + count_g - 1:\n               awkwardness_b_first += (j - i)\n       \n       # Calculate awkwardness for arrangement \"gg...gbb...b\"\n       awkwardness_g_first = 0\n       for i from 0 to count_g - 1:\n           for j from count_g to count_g + count_b - 1:\n               awkwardness_g_first += (j - i)\n       \n       return minimum(awkwardness_b_first, awkwardness_g_first)\n\n   function main():\n       read T\n       for each test case:\n           read s\n           result = calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s)\n           print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s):\n    count_b = s.count('b')  # Count the number of boys\n    count_g = s.count('g')  # Count the number of girls\n    \n    # Calculate awkwardness for arrangement \"bb...bgg...g\"\n    awkwardness_b_first = 0\n    for i in range(count_b):\n        for j in range(count_b, count_b + count_g):\n            awkwardness_b_first += (j - i)\n    \n    # Calculate awkwardness for arrangement \"gg...gbb...b\"\n    awkwardness_g_first = 0\n    for i in range(count_g):\n        for j in range(count_g, count_g + count_b):\n            awkwardness_g_first += (j - i)\n    \n    # Return the minimum awkwardness from both arrangements\n    return min(awkwardness_b_first, awkwardness_g_first)\n\ndef main():\n    T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n    for _ in range(T):\n        s = input().strip()  # Read the string for each test case\n        result = calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s)  # Calculate minimum awkwardness\n        print(result)  # Print the result for each test case\n\nmain()  # Call the main function to execute the solution\n```",
