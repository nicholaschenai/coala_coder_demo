    "summary": "In this task, the goal was to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers for multiple queries efficiently, given the constraints where N and K can be as large as 10^18. The key concepts involved were matrix exponentiation for calculating Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time and understanding the properties of Fibonacci sequences to derive sums.\n\nThe approach taken involved defining a matrix exponentiation function to compute Fibonacci numbers, as well as a function to sum the required Fibonacci numbers starting from the N-th index. The matrix multiplication was implemented to facilitate the exponentiation process. The solution was structured to read multiple queries and output the results accordingly.\n\nThe final implementation successfully handled the example provided, demonstrating that the approach was effective. The use of matrix exponentiation proved to be a crucial strategy for efficiently calculating Fibonacci numbers, especially given the large input constraints. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of optimizing algorithms for performance in competitive programming contexts.",
    "reflection": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach to compute Fibonacci numbers and their sums, particularly for large values of N and K, which can go up to 10^18. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Matrix Exponentiation**: The official solution uses a recursive method to compute Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time. The function `_fib(n)` computes Fibonacci numbers using the properties of Fibonacci sequences and matrix exponentiation, which is more efficient than the iterative or naive recursive methods.\n\n2. **Modular Arithmetic**: The solution incorporates modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and prevent overflow. This is crucial given the constraints, as results need to be computed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n3. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: Instead of calculating each Fibonacci number individually for the sum, the solution uses a mathematical formula to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers multiplied by powers of K. This is done in the `ans(n, k)` function, which leverages pre-computed Fibonacci values and properties of geometric series.\n\n4. **Inverse Calculation**: The function `inv(n)` computes the modular inverse, which is necessary for division in modular arithmetic. This is done using Fermat's Little Theorem, which is efficient for prime moduli.\n\n5. **Overall Complexity**: The official solution is efficient, with the Fibonacci computation being logarithmic in terms of N, and the sum calculation being constant time due to the pre-computed values and mathematical properties.\n\nIn contrast, my initial approach involved directly summing Fibonacci numbers in a loop, which is not feasible for large N and K due to time complexity. The official solution's use of mathematical properties and modular arithmetic provides a significant advantage in both time and space efficiency. This experience highlights the importance of leveraging mathematical insights and efficient algorithms when dealing with large input sizes in competitive programming.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: sum_fibonacci]\nThis function calculates the sum of K consecutive Fibonacci numbers starting from the n-th Fibonacci number. It initializes a total sum to zero and iterates K times, adding each Fibonacci number from F(n) to F(n + K - 1) to the total sum. The Fibonacci numbers are computed using a separate function that employs matrix exponentiation for efficient calculation. After accumulating the sum, the function returns the total. The function is designed to handle multiple queries, each specifying different values of N and K. The results are printed for each query after computation.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to efficiently compute Fibonacci numbers, especially for large indices, due to the constraints of the problem (N and K can be as large as 10^18). It can be applied in competitive programming, algorithm design, and optimization tasks where performance is critical. The matrix exponentiation technique allows for logarithmic time complexity in calculating Fibonacci numbers, making it suitable for high-performance applications. Additionally, understanding this approach can help in similar problems involving recurrence relations and series summation."
