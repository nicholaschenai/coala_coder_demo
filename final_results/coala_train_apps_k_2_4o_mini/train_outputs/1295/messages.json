Each query specified a range of indices, and the goal was to return the sum of the values in that range for each query. The problem involved reading multiple test cases, processing a list of integers, and efficiently calculating sums based on given indices.\n\n    The solution involved iterating through each test case, reading the number of bills and queries, and then processing each query by summing the specified range of values. The use of Python's built-in `sum()` function allowed for straightforward calculation of the sums. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints provided.\n\n    The final code snippet effectively handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that results were printed for each query. The approach was successful, and no unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation. The key takeaway was the importance of efficiently managing input and output, especially when dealing with potentially large datasets. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def process_queries(T):\n        for _ in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case\n            N, Q = map(int, input().split())  # Read number of bills and queries\n            bills = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the list of bills\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):  # Iterate over each query\n                X, Y = map(int, input().split())  # Read the query indices\n                # Calculate the sum from index X-1 to Y-1 (inclusive)\n                total_sum = sum(bills[X-1:Y])  \n                print(total_sum)  # Output the result for the query\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    process_queries(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th term in a specific series defined as 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, etc. Initially, I misidentified the formula for generating the series, leading to incorrect outputs. The series is based on the sum of squares of the first (N-1) integers, which I failed to recognize at first.\n\n    The correct approach involves calculating the sum of squares up to (N-1). The formula for the N'th term can be derived as follows: T(N) = sum(i^2) for i from 0 to N-1. This realization led to the correct implementation of the function.\n\n    The final working code correctly computes the N'th term using a loop to sum the squares:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_series(N):\n        sum_of_squares = 0\n        for i in range(N):\n            sum_of_squares += i * i\n        return sum_of_squares\n\n    T = int(input())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        result = calculate_series(N)\n        print(result)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing the series and recognizing patterns, as well as the need to validate the derived formulas against sample outputs.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The function `_fib(n)` computes Fibonacci numbers using the properties of Fibonacci sequences and matrix exponentiation, which is more efficient than the iterative or naive recursive methods.\n\n2. **Modular Arithmetic**: The solution incorporates modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and prevent overflow. This is crucial given the constraints, as results need to be computed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n3. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: Instead of calculating each Fibonacci number individually for the sum, the solution uses a mathematical formula to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers multiplied by powers of K. This is done in the `ans(n, k)` function, which leverages pre-computed Fibonacci values and properties of geometric series.\n\n4. **Inverse Calculation**: The function `inv(n)` computes the modular inverse, which is necessary for division in modular arithmetic. This is done using Fermat's Little Theorem, which is efficient for prime moduli.\n\n5. **Overall Complexity**: The official solution is efficient, with the Fibonacci computation being logarithmic in terms of N, and the sum calculation being constant time due to the pre-computed values and mathematical properties.\n\nIn contrast, my initial approach involved directly summing Fibonacci numbers in a loop, which is not feasible for large N and K due to time complexity.
