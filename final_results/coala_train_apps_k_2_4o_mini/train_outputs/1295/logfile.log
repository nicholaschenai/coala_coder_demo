## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In the year 4242, the language Haskell has evolved so much that it has become an AI. It can solve very challenging problems, in very little time. Humanity is worried that Haskell will take over the world. All hopes remain tied to the Competitive Programming community as they are the expert in shaving milliseconds off code runtime. Haskell creators have found one particular task that if solved faster than Haskell itself, can be used to hack into Haskell's codebase and thus defeat it. The exact details of the task are as follows,


" Calculate the sum, S(N, K) = , for Q queries. Here Fi is ith Fibonacci number defined as: Fi = i if i = 0 or 1 and Fi = Fi-1 + Fi-2 if i >= 2. "


You being a member of the Competitive Programming community are encouraged to make a submission to this task.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer Q, the number of queries.

Each of the next Q lines contain two integers each, Ni and Ki.

-----Output-----

Output Q lines with one integer each. The ith line should contain the value S(Ni, Ki).

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= Q <= 5*104
- 1 <= N <= 1018
- 1 <= K <= 1018

-----Example-----
Input:
1
1 1
Output:

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to calculate a sum based on Fibonacci numbers for multiple queries. Each query provides two numbers, N and K, and we need to compute the sum of the first K Fibonacci numbers starting from the N-th Fibonacci number.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - The Fibonacci sequence is defined such that F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, and for any i >= 2, F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2).
   - For each query, we need to find the N-th Fibonacci number and then sum the next K Fibonacci numbers starting from F(N).
   - Given the constraints (N and K can be as large as 10^18), we cannot compute Fibonacci numbers directly using a simple iterative or recursive approach due to time and space limitations.
   - Instead, we can use matrix exponentiation to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently in logarithmic time.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```

       result = matrix_pow(F, n - 1)
       return result[0][0]  // F(n)

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Avani calculate the sum of values from a list of bills based on multiple queries. Each query specified a range of indices, and the goal was to return the sum of the values in that range for each query. The problem involved reading multiple test cases, processing a list of integers, and efficiently calculating sums based on given indices.

    The solution involved iterating through each test case, reading the number of bills and queries, and then processing each query by summing the specified range of values. The use of Python's built-in `sum()` function allowed for straightforward calculation of the sums. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints provided.

    The final code snippet effectively handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that results were printed for each query. The approach was successful, and no unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation. The key takeaway was the importance of efficiently managing input and output, especially when dealing with potentially large datasets. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code for reference:

    ```python
    def process_queries(T):
        for _ in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case
            N, Q = map(int, input().split())  # Read number of bills and queries
            bills = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the list of bills
        
            for __ in range(Q):  # Iterate over each query
                X, Y = map(int, input().split())  # Read the query indices
                # Calculate the sum from index X-1 to Y-1 (inclusive)
                total_sum = sum(bills[X-1:Y])  
                print(total_sum)  # Output the result for the query

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    process_queries(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases
    ```
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th term in a specific series defined as 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, etc. Initially, I misidentified the formula for generating the series, leading to incorrect outputs. The series is based on the sum of squares of the first (N-1) integers, which I failed to recognize at first.

    The correct approach involves calculating the sum of squares up to (N-1). The formula for the N'th term can be derived as follows: T(N) = sum(i^2) for i from 0 to N-1. This realization led to the correct implementation of the function.

    The final working code correctly computes the N'th term using a loop to sum the squares:

    ```python
    def calculate_series(N):
        sum_of_squares = 0
        for i in range(N):
            sum_of_squares += i * i
        return sum_of_squares

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        result = calculate_series(N)
        print(result)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing the series and recognizing patterns, as well as the need to validate the derived formulas against sample outputs.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to compute a specific sum based on Fibonacci numbers for multiple queries. Each query provides two numbers, N and K, and we need to calculate the sum of the first K Fibonacci numbers starting from the N-th Fibonacci number.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - We need to efficiently compute Fibonacci numbers, especially since N and K can be as large as 10^18.
   - Instead of calculating Fibonacci numbers directly, we can use matrix exponentiation to compute Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time.
   - For each query, we will compute the N-th Fibonacci number and then sum the next K Fibonacci numbers.
   - The sum of Fibonacci numbers can be derived from the properties of Fibonacci sequences.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers for multiple queries efficiently, given the constraints where N and K can be as large as 10^18. The key concepts involved were matrix exponentiation for calculating Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time and understanding the properties of Fibonacci sequences to derive sums.

The approach taken involved defining a matrix exponentiation function to compute Fibonacci numbers, as well as a function to sum the required Fibonacci numbers starting from the N-th index. The matrix multiplication was implemented to facilitate the exponentiation process. The solution was structured to read multiple queries and output the results accordingly.

The final implementation successfully handled the example provided, demonstrating that the approach was effective. The use of matrix exponentiation proved to be a crucial strategy for efficiently calculating Fibonacci numbers, especially given the large input constraints. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of optimizing algorithms for performance in competitive programming contexts.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] The official solution employs a more efficient approach to compute Fibonacci numbers and their sums, particularly for large values of N and K, which can go up to 10^18. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Matrix Exponentiation**: The official solution uses a recursive method to compute Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time. The function `_fib(n)` computes Fibonacci numbers using the properties of Fibonacci sequences and matrix exponentiation, which is more efficient than the iterative or naive recursive methods.

2. **Modular Arithmetic**: The solution incorporates modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and prevent overflow. This is crucial given the constraints, as results need to be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: Instead of calculating each Fibonacci number individually for the sum, the solution uses a mathematical formula to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers multiplied by powers of K. This is done in the `ans(n, k)` function, which leverages pre-computed Fibonacci values and properties of geometric series.

4. **Inverse Calculation**: The function `inv(n)` computes the modular inverse, which is necessary for division in modular arithmetic. This is done using Fermat's Little Theorem, which is efficient for prime moduli.

5. **Overall Complexity**: The official solution is efficient, with the Fibonacci computation being logarithmic in terms of N, and the sum calculation being constant time due to the pre-computed values and mathematical properties.

In contrast, my initial approach involved directly summing Fibonacci numbers in a loop, which is not feasible for large N and K due to time complexity. The official solution's use of mathematical properties and modular arithmetic provides a significant advantage in both time and space efficiency. This experience highlights the importance of leveraging mathematical insights and efficient algorithms when dealing with large input sizes in competitive programming.
