The solution utilized a sliding window approach, which is effective for problems involving contiguous subarrays. \n\n    The core concept involved maintaining two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the current subarray. As the `right` pointer expanded to include more elements, we counted the odd numbers. If the count exceeded `k`, we moved the `left` pointer to reduce the count. When the count matched `k`, we calculated how many valid subarrays could be formed by counting the even numbers to the left of the `left` pointer.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test cases. The key strategies that worked included efficiently managing the count of odd numbers and leveraging the properties of even numbers to determine the number of valid subarrays. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed well within the constraints. \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:\n            count = 0\n            left = 0\n            odd_count = 0\n            total_nice_subarrays = 0\n        \n            for right in range(len(nums)):\n                if nums[right] % 2 == 1:\n                    odd_count += 1\n            \n                while odd_count > k:\n                    if nums[left] % 2 == 1:\n                        odd_count -= 1\n                    left += 1\n            \n                if odd_count == k:\n                    temp_left = left\n                    while temp_left < right and nums[temp_left] % 2 == 0:\n                        temp_left += 1\n                    count_left = temp_left - left + 1\n                    total_nice_subarrays += count_left\n        \n            return total_nice_subarrays\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the effectiveness of the sliding window technique for problems involving subarrays and counting specific conditions.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved finding the length of the shortest contiguous subarray with a sum of at least K. The solution utilized a combination of prefix sums and a deque to efficiently track potential subarrays. The key concepts included maintaining a running sum and using a sliding window approach to dynamically adjust the size of the subarray while checking for the required sum.\n\n    The implemented strategy involved calculating prefix sums to facilitate quick sum calculations for any subarray. A deque was used to store indices of the prefix sums, allowing for efficient removal of elements that no longer contributed to valid subarrays. The algorithm successfully handled edge cases, such as when no valid subarray exists, by returning -1.\n\n    The final code was structured to ensure clarity and efficiency, and it passed all provided test cases. The approach demonstrated the effectiveness of using prefix sums and deques for problems involving subarray sums, which is a common pattern in competitive programming. \n\n    Here is the final solution for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def shortestSubarray(self, A: list[int], K: int) -> int:\n            from collections import deque\n        \n            n = len(A)\n            prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)\n        \n            # Calculate prefix sums\n            for i in range(n):\n                prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + A[i]\n        \n            min_length = float('inf')\n            dq = deque()\n        \n            for i in range(n + 1):\n                # Check if we can form a valid subarray\n                while dq and prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[dq[0]] >= K:\n                    min_length = min(min_length, i - dq.popleft())\n            \n                # Maintain the deque in increasing order of prefix sums\n                while dq and prefix_sum[i] <= prefix_sum[dq[-1]]:\n                    dq.pop()\n            \n                dq.append(i)\n        \n            return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The array `B` holds the cumulative sums of the original array `A`, while `C` holds the cumulative sums of `B`. This allows for quick calculations of subarray sums without needing to iterate through the array multiple times.\n\n2. **Counting Sums**: The function `count_sum_under(score)` uses a two-pointer technique to efficiently count how many subarray sums are less than or equal to a given score. This avoids the need to sort all subarray sums explicitly, which can be computationally expensive.\n\n3. **Binary Search for K-th Score**: The function `kth_score(k)` uses binary search to find the k-th smallest subarray sum. This is a crucial optimization that allows the solution to avoid generating and sorting all subarray sums directly.\n\n4. **Final Calculation**: The result is computed by finding the sums of subarray sums up to the specified indices using the helper function `sum_k_sums(k)`, which leverages the previously defined functions to efficiently compute the required sums.\n\n### Reflection on My Approach:\nMy initial approach involved generating all subarray sums and sorting them, which is straightforward but inefficient for larger inputs. The official solution's use of prefix sums and binary search not only reduces the time complexity but also avoids the need for extensive memory usage associated with storing all subarray sums. This experience highlights the importance of considering more advanced techniques like prefix sums and binary search in problems involving cumulative calculations and sorted order retrieval."
