## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays fromÂ the array and then sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2Â numbers.
Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in theÂ new array.Â Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
Output: 13 
Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10
Output: 50

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
nums.length == n
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
1 <= left <= rightÂ <= n * (n + 1) / 2

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to count the number of continuous subarrays that contain exactly `k` odd numbers from a given list of integers. The solution utilized a sliding window approach, which is effective for problems involving contiguous subarrays. 

    The core concept involved maintaining two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the current subarray. As the `right` pointer expanded to include more elements, we counted the odd numbers. If the count exceeded `k`, we moved the `left` pointer to reduce the count. When the count matched `k`, we calculated how many valid subarrays could be formed by counting the even numbers to the left of the `left` pointer.

    The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test cases. The key strategies that worked included efficiently managing the count of odd numbers and leveraging the properties of even numbers to determine the number of valid subarrays. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed well within the constraints. 

    The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
            count = 0
            left = 0
            odd_count = 0
            total_nice_subarrays = 0
        
            for right in range(len(nums)):
                if nums[right] % 2 == 1:
                    odd_count += 1
            
                while odd_count > k:
                    if nums[left] % 2 == 1:
                        odd_count -= 1
                    left += 1
            
                if odd_count == k:
                    temp_left = left
                    while temp_left < right and nums[temp_left] % 2 == 0:
                        temp_left += 1
                    count_left = temp_left - left + 1
                    total_nice_subarrays += count_left
        
            return total_nice_subarrays
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the effectiveness of the sliding window technique for problems involving subarrays and counting specific conditions.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    The problem involved finding the length of the shortest contiguous subarray with a sum of at least K. The solution utilized a combination of prefix sums and a deque to efficiently track potential subarrays. The key concepts included maintaining a running sum and using a sliding window approach to dynamically adjust the size of the subarray while checking for the required sum.

    The implemented strategy involved calculating prefix sums to facilitate quick sum calculations for any subarray. A deque was used to store indices of the prefix sums, allowing for efficient removal of elements that no longer contributed to valid subarrays. The algorithm successfully handled edge cases, such as when no valid subarray exists, by returning -1.

    The final code was structured to ensure clarity and efficiency, and it passed all provided test cases. The approach demonstrated the effectiveness of using prefix sums and deques for problems involving subarray sums, which is a common pattern in competitive programming. 

    Here is the final solution for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def shortestSubarray(self, A: list[int], K: int) -> int:
            from collections import deque
        
            n = len(A)
            prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
        
            # Calculate prefix sums
            for i in range(n):
                prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + A[i]
        
            min_length = float('inf')
            dq = deque()
        
            for i in range(n + 1):
                # Check if we can form a valid subarray
                while dq and prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[dq[0]] >= K:
                    min_length = min(min_length, i - dq.popleft())
            
                # Maintain the deque in increasing order of prefix sums
                while dq and prefix_sum[i] <= prefix_sum[dq[-1]]:
                    dq.pop()
            
                dq.append(i)

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays fromÂ the array and then sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2Â numbers.
Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in theÂ new array.Â Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
Output: 13 
Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10
Output: 50

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
nums.length == n
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
1 <= left <= rightÂ <= n * (n + 1) / 2

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] In this task, I was required to compute the sum of all non-empty continuous subarrays from a given array of positive integers, sort these sums, and then return the sum of a specified range of indices from the sorted list. The solution involved generating all possible subarray sums, sorting them, and then summing the relevant elements based on the provided indices.

The core concepts tested in this problem included:
- Generating subarrays and calculating their sums efficiently.
- Sorting a list of integers.
- Handling 1-based indexing when accessing elements in the sorted list.

The implemented solution successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach of using nested loops to generate subarray sums and then sorting the results was effective. The final implementation was straightforward and utilized basic list operations without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints of the problem.

The final code snippet is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def rangeSum(self, nums: list[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        subarray_sums = []
        for i in range(n):

            result += subarray_sums[index]
        return result % (10**9 + 7)
```

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding array manipulation and sorting algorithms, as well as the need to carefully manage indexing when working with different conventions.

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] The official solution employs a more efficient approach using prefix sums and binary search, which significantly optimizes the process of calculating subarray sums compared to the brute-force method I initially implemented. 

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Prefix Sums**: The solution constructs two prefix sum arrays, `B` and `C`. The array `B` holds the cumulative sums of the original array `A`, while `C` holds the cumulative sums of `B`. This allows for quick calculations of subarray sums without needing to iterate through the array multiple times.

2. **Counting Sums**: The function `count_sum_under(score)` uses a two-pointer technique to efficiently count how many subarray sums are less than or equal to a given score. This avoids the need to sort all subarray sums explicitly, which can be computationally expensive.

3. **Binary Search for K-th Score**: The function `kth_score(k)` uses binary search to find the k-th smallest subarray sum. This is a crucial optimization that allows the solution to avoid generating and sorting all subarray sums directly.

4. **Final Calculation**: The result is computed by finding the sums of subarray sums up to the specified indices using the helper function `sum_k_sums(k)`, which leverages the previously defined functions to efficiently compute the required sums.

### Reflection on My Approach:
My initial approach involved generating all subarray sums and sorting them, which is straightforward but inefficient for larger inputs. The official solution's use of prefix sums and binary search not only reduces the time complexity but also avoids the need for extensive memory usage associated with storing all subarray sums. This experience highlights the importance of considering more advanced techniques like prefix sums and binary search in problems involving cumulative calculations and sorted order retrieval.

    Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in theÂ new array.Â Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
Â 
    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
    Output: 13 
    Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 

    Example 2:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.

    Example 3:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10
    Output: 50

Â 
    Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
    nums.length == n
    1 <= nums[i] <= 100
    1 <= left <= rightÂ <= n * (n + 1) / 2

[Solution]

    class Solution:
        def rangeSum(self, nums: list[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
            # Step 1: Initialize a list to store the sums of all subarrays
            subarray_sums = []
        
            # Step 2: Generate all subarray sums
            for i in range(n):
                current_sum = 0
                for j in range(i, n):
                    current_sum += nums[j]
                    subarray_sums.append(current_sum)
        
            # Step 3: Sort the list of subarray sums
            subarray_sums.sort()
        
            # Step 4: Calculate the sum from index left to right (1-based index)
            result = 0
            for index in range(left - 1, right):
                result += subarray_sums[index]
        
            # Step 5: Return the result modulo 10^9 + 7
            return result % (10**9 + 7)
