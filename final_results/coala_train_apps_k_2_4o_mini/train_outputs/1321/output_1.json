The series is defined by the sum of squares of the first (N-1) integers. \n\nHere\u2019s the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_series(N):\n    # Calculate the N'th term in the series by summing squares of the first (N-1) integers\n    sum_of_squares = 0\n    for i in range(N):  # Loop from 0 to N-1\n        sum_of_squares += i * i  # Add the square of each integer\n    return sum_of_squares  # Return the computed sum\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case\n    N = int(input())  # Read the integer N for the current test case\n    result = calculate_series(N)  # Calculate the N'th term\n    print(result)  # Output the result for the test case\n``` \n\nThis code correctly implements the logic to compute the N'th term in the series by summing the squares of integers from 0 to (N-1). Each test case is processed in a loop, and the results are printed as required.",
