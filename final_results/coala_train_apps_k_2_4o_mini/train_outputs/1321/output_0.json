    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to find the N'th number in a specific series defined as 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, etc. The input consists of multiple test cases, each specifying a value of N, and the output should be the corresponding number from the series for each test case.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or formula that generates the series. By observing the series, we can derive that the N'th term can be calculated using a specific formula. We will read the number of test cases, then for each test case, compute the N'th term using the derived formula and print the results.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function calculate_series(N):\n       return (N * (N + 1) * (N + 2)) // 6  # This is the formula for the N'th term\n\n   read T  # number of test cases\n   for each test case from 1 to T:\n       read N\n       result = calculate_series(N - 1)  # N - 1 because series is 0-indexed\n       print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef calculate_series(N):\n    # Calculate the N'th term in the series using the derived formula\n    return (N * (N + 1) * (N + 2)) // 6  # This is the formula for the N'th term\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case\n    N = int(input())  # Read the integer N for the current test case\n    result = calculate_series(N - 1)  # N - 1 because series is 0-indexed\n    print(result)  # Output the result for the test case\n```",
