INFO - [Task id] 1321 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem requires us to find the N'th number in a specific series defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... For multiple test cases, we need to compute and print the N'th number in this series.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or formula that generates the series. By examining the series, we can see that each term can be derived from the previous terms. The series appears to be related to triangular numbers. We can derive the N'th term using a formula based on the sum of the first N natural numbers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function findNthNumber(N):
       if N == 1:
           return 0
       else:
           sum = 0
           for i from 1 to N:
               sum += i * (i + 1) / 2
           return sum

   function main():
       read T
       for each test case from 1 to T:
           read N
           result = findNthNumber(N)
           print result
   ```

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Avani calculate the sum of values from a list of bills based on multiple queries. Each query specified a range of indices, and the goal was to return the sum of the values in that range for each query. The problem involved reading multiple test cases, processing a list of integers, and efficiently calculating sums based on given indices.

    The solution involved iterating through each test case, reading the number of bills and queries, and then processing each query by summing the specified range of values. The use of Python's built-in `sum()` function allowed for straightforward calculation of the sums. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints provided.

    The final code snippet effectively handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that results were printed for each query. The approach was successful, and no unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation. The key takeaway was the importance of efficiently managing input and output, especially when dealing with potentially large datasets. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code for reference:

    ```python
    def process_queries(T):
        for _ in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case
            N, Q = map(int, input().split())  # Read number of bills and queries
            bills = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the list of bills
        
            for __ in range(Q):  # Iterate over each query
                X, Y = map(int, input().split())  # Read the query indices
                # Calculate the sum from index X-1 to Y-1 (inclusive)
                total_sum = sum(bills[X-1:Y])  
                print(total_sum)  # Output the result for the query

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    process_queries(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases
    ```
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to generate a specific pattern of numbers based on an integer input K for multiple test cases. The expected output required careful formatting, specifically ensuring that each test case's output was printed consecutively without extra blank lines, except for the required separation after each test case.

    Initially, the code correctly generated the required patterns but failed to format the output correctly. The main issue was the handling of blank lines between test cases, which led to extra blank lines being printed. The expected output format required that there be no blank line after the last test case.

    The solution involved iterating through each test case, generating the pattern for each K, and printing the lines immediately. A conditional check was added to print a blank line only if the current test case was not the last one. This adjustment ensured that the output adhered to the expected format.

    Hereâ€™s the final working code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def generate_pattern(T):
        for t in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case
            K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case
            for i in range(K):  # For each line from 0 to K-1
                line = ""  # Initialize an empty line
                for j in range(i, -1, -1):  # Create the line by counting down from i to 0
                    line += str(j)  # Append the current number to the line
                print(line)  # Print the generated line
            if t < T - 1:  # If this is not the last test case, print a blank line
                print()  # Print a blank line to separate test cases

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    generate_pattern(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of output formatting in programming challenges, as even minor discrepancies can lead to test failures.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1321 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Series**: The series provided is:
   - 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
   We need to find the N'th term in this series. 

2. **Identifying the Pattern**: 
   - The series does not follow a simple arithmetic or geometric progression. 
   - By examining the differences between consecutive terms:
     - 1 - 0 = 1
     - 5 - 1 = 4
     - 14 - 5 = 9
     - 30 - 14 = 16
     - 55 - 30 = 25
   - The differences are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, which are perfect squares (1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2).
   - This suggests that the N'th term can be derived from the sum of squares.

3. **Correct Formula**: 
   - The N'th term can be calculated as:
     - T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2
   - This means we need to sum the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers to get the N'th term.

4. **Where the Code Went Wrong**: 
   - The formula I initially used was incorrect. I mistakenly used a formula that does not correspond to the series provided. The correct approach is to sum the squares of the first (N-1) integers.

5. **Revising the Code**: 
   - I will implement a loop to calculate the sum of squares up to (N-1) for each test case.

Now, let's write the corrected code based on this understanding.

```python
def calculate_series(N):
    # Calculate the N'th term in the series by summing squares of the first (N-1) integers
    sum_of_squares = 0
    for i in range(N):
        sum_of_squares += i * i  # Add the square of each integer from 0 to N-1
    return sum_of_squares  # Return the computed sum

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case
    N = int(input())  # Read the integer N for the current test case
    result = calculate_series(N)  # Calculate the N'th term
    print(result)  # Output the result for the test case

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1321 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to find the N'th number in a specific series defined as 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, etc. The input consists of multiple test cases, each specifying a value of N, and the output should be the corresponding number from the series for each test case.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or formula that generates the series. By observing the series, we can derive that the N'th term can be calculated using a specific formula. We will read the number of test cases, then for each test case, compute the N'th term using the derived formula and print the results.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function calculate_series(N):
       return (N * (N + 1) * (N + 2)) // 6  # This is the formula for the N'th term

   read T  # number of test cases
   for each test case from 1 to T:
       read N
       result = calculate_series(N - 1)  # N - 1 because series is 0-indexed
       print result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python

    print(result)  # Output the result for the test case

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1321 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Series**: The series provided is:
   - 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
   We need to find the N'th term in this series. 

2. **Identifying the Pattern**: 
   - The series does not follow a simple arithmetic or geometric progression. 
   - By examining the differences between consecutive terms:
     - 1 - 0 = 1
     - 5 - 1 = 4
     - 14 - 5 = 9
     - 30 - 14 = 16
     - 55 - 30 = 25
   - The differences are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, which are perfect squares (1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2).
   - This suggests that the N'th term can be derived from the sum of squares.

3. **Correct Formula**: 
   - The N'th term can be calculated as:
     - T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2
   - This means we need to sum the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers to get the N'th term.

4. **Where the Code Went Wrong**: 
   - The formula I initially used was incorrect. I mistakenly used a formula that does not correspond to the series provided. The correct approach is to sum the squares of the first (N-1) integers.

5. **Revising the Code**: 
   - I will implement a loop to calculate the sum of squares up to (N-1) for each test case.

Now, let's write the corrected code based on this understanding.

```python
def calculate_series(N):
    # Calculate the N'th term in the series by summing squares of the first (N-1) integers
    sum_of_squares = 0
    for i in range(N):
        sum_of_squares += i * i  # Add the square of each integer from 0 to N-1
    return sum_of_squares  # Return the computed sum

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case
    N = int(input())  # Read the integer N for the current test case
    result = calculate_series(N)  # Calculate the N'th term
    print(result)  # Output the result for the test case

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Avani calculate the sum of values from a list of bills based on multiple queries. Each query specified a range of indices, and the goal was to return the sum of the values in that range for each query. The problem involved reading multiple test cases, processing a list of integers, and efficiently calculating sums based on given indices.

    The solution involved iterating through each test case, reading the number of bills and queries, and then processing each query by summing the specified range of values. The use of Python's built-in `sum()` function allowed for straightforward calculation of the sums. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints provided.

    The final code snippet effectively handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that results were printed for each query. The approach was successful, and no unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation. The key takeaway was the importance of efficiently managing input and output, especially when dealing with potentially large datasets. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code for reference:

    ```python
    def process_queries(T):
        for _ in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case
            N, Q = map(int, input().split())  # Read number of bills and queries
            bills = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the list of bills
        
            for __ in range(Q):  # Iterate over each query
                X, Y = map(int, input().split())  # Read the query indices
                # Calculate the sum from index X-1 to Y-1 (inclusive)
                total_sum = sum(bills[X-1:Y])  
                print(total_sum)  # Output the result for the query

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    process_queries(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases
    ```
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to calculate the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. The relationship between the number of particles at time `t` and `t-1` is defined by the factorial function, leading to the formula `N! * X`. Given the constraints where `N` can be as large as \(10^{18}\), direct computation of `N!` is impractical. 

    The key insight was recognizing that if `N` is greater than or equal to \(10^6 + 3\), the result would be `0` due to the factorial containing that modulus as a factor. For smaller values of `N`, I implemented a function to compute `N!` modulo \(10^6 + 3\). 

    The final solution involved two main functions: one for calculating the factorial modulo a number and another for determining the number of particles based on the input values. The implementation was straightforward and passed the provided test cases successfully. 

    Hereâ€™s the core code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def factorial_mod(n, mod):
        result = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            result = (result * i) % mod
            if result == 0:
                break
        return result

    def calculate_particles(N, X):
        mod = 10**6 + 3
        if N >= mod:
            return 0
        else:
            factorial_value = factorial_mod(N, mod)
            return (factorial_value * X) % mod
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding modular arithmetic and the implications of large input sizes on computational feasibility.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1321 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Series**: The series provided is:
   - 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
   We need to find the N'th term in this series. 

2. **Identifying the Pattern**: 
   - The series does not follow a simple arithmetic or geometric progression. 
   - By examining the differences between consecutive terms:
     - 1 - 0 = 1
     - 5 - 1 = 4
     - 14 - 5 = 9
     - 30 - 14 = 16
     - 55 - 30 = 25
   - The differences are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, which are perfect squares (1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2).
   - This suggests that the N'th term can be derived from the sum of squares.

3. **Correct Formula**: 
   - The N'th term can be calculated as:
     - T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2
   - This means we need to sum the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers to get the N'th term.

4. **Where the Code Went Wrong**: 
   - The formula I initially used was incorrect. I mistakenly used a formula that does not correspond to the series provided. The correct approach is to sum the squares of the first (N-1) integers.

5. **Revising the Code**: 
   - I will implement a loop to calculate the sum of squares up to (N-1) for each test case.

INFO - [Task id] 1321 [prompt] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will correct the solution to compute the N'th term in the series correctly. The series is defined by the sum of squares of the first (N-1) integers. 

Hereâ€™s the corrected Python code:

```python
def calculate_series(N):
    # Calculate the N'th term in the series by summing squares of the first (N-1) integers
    sum_of_squares = 0
    for i in range(N):  # Loop from 0 to N-1
        sum_of_squares += i * i  # Add the square of each integer
    return sum_of_squares  # Return the computed sum

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case
    N = int(input())  # Read the integer N for the current test case
    result = calculate_series(N)  # Calculate the N'th term
    print(result)  # Output the result for the test case
``` 

This code correctly implements the logic to compute the N'th term in the series by summing the squares of integers from 0 to (N-1). Each test case is processed in a loop, and the results are printed as required.

INFO - [Task id] 1321 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th term in a specific series defined as 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, etc. Initially, I misidentified the formula for generating the series, leading to incorrect outputs. The series is based on the sum of squares of the first (N-1) integers, which I failed to recognize at first.

The correct approach involves calculating the sum of squares up to (N-1). The formula for the N'th term can be derived as follows: T(N) = sum(i^2) for i from 0 to N-1. This realization led to the correct implementation of the function.

The final working code correctly computes the N'th term using a loop to sum the squares:

```python
def calculate_series(N):
    sum_of_squares = 0
    for i in range(N):
        sum_of_squares += i * i
    return sum_of_squares

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    result = calculate_series(N)
    print(result)
```

This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing the series and recognizing patterns, as well as the need to validate the derived formulas against sample outputs.

3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1321 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to find the N'th number in a specific series defined as 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, etc. The input consists of multiple test cases, each specifying a value of N, and the output should be the corresponding number from the series for each test case.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or formula that generates the series. By observing the series, we can derive that the N'th term can be calculated using a specific formula. We will read the number of test cases, then for each test case, compute the N'th term using the derived formula and print the results.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function calculate_series(N):
       return (N * (N + 1) * (N + 2)) // 6  # This is the formula for the N'th term

   read T  # number of test cases
   for each test case from 1 to T:
       read N
       result = calculate_series(N - 1)  # N - 1 because series is 0-indexed
       print result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def calculate_series(N):
    # Calculate the N'th term in the series using the derived formula
    return (N * (N + 1) * (N + 2)) // 6  # This is the formula for the N'th term

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case
    N = int(input())  # Read the integer N for the current test case
    result = calculate_series(N - 1)  # N - 1 because series is 0-indexed
    print(result)  # Output the result for the test case

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1321 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Series**: The series provided is:
   - 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ...
   We need to find the N'th term in this series. 

2. **Identifying the Pattern**: 
   - The series does not follow a simple arithmetic or geometric progression. 
   - By examining the differences between consecutive terms:
     - 1 - 0 = 1
     - 5 - 1 = 4
     - 14 - 5 = 9
     - 30 - 14 = 16
     - 55 - 30 = 25
   - The differences are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, which are perfect squares (1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2).
   - This suggests that the N'th term can be derived from the sum of squares.

3. **Correct Formula**: 
   - The N'th term can be calculated as:
     - T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2
   - This means we need to sum the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers to get the N'th term.

4. **Where the Code Went Wrong**: 
   - The formula I initially used was incorrect. I mistakenly used a formula that does not correspond to the series provided. The correct approach is to sum the squares of the first (N-1) integers.

5. **Revising the Code**: 
   - I will implement a loop to calculate the sum of squares up to (N-1) for each test case.

Now, let's write the corrected code based on this understanding.

```python
def calculate_series(N):
    # Calculate the N'th term in the series by summing squares of the first (N-1) integers
    sum_of_squares = 0
    for i in range(N):
        sum_of_squares += i * i  # Add the square of each integer from 0 to N-1
    return sum_of_squares  # Return the computed sum

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case
    N = int(input())  # Read the integer N for the current test case
    result = calculate_series(N)  # Calculate the N'th term
    print(result)  # Output the result for the test case

## Instructions

- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

    else:
        n=n-2

        print(int(l))


INFO - [Task id] 1321 [generation text] In this experience, I learned the importance of correctly identifying the underlying pattern in a mathematical series. Initially, I misinterpreted the series and used an incorrect formula based on the sum of squares, which led to incorrect outputs for certain test cases. The official solution, however, effectively derives the N'th term using a more direct mathematical formula.

The key insight from the official solution is the use of a specific formula to compute the N'th term directly, which is derived from the series properties. The formula used is:

\[ T(N) = \frac{(N-2 + 1)(2(N-2) + 3)(N-2 + 2)}{6} \]

This formula allows for efficient computation without the need for iterative summation, significantly improving performance, especially given the constraints where \( N \) can be as large as 10,000 and there can be up to 10,000 test cases.

In summary, the official solution is more efficient and concise, leveraging a mathematical approach to derive the result directly, while my initial approach was overly complex and incorrect. This experience reinforces the importance of thoroughly analyzing the problem and seeking patterns or formulas that can simplify the solution.
