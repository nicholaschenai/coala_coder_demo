    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th term in a specific series defined as 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, etc. Initially, I misidentified the formula for generating the series, leading to incorrect outputs. The series is based on the sum of squares of the first (N-1) integers, which I failed to recognize at first.\n\nThe correct approach involves calculating the sum of squares up to (N-1). The formula for the N'th term can be derived as follows: T(N) = sum(i^2) for i from 0 to N-1. This realization led to the correct implementation of the function.\n\nThe final working code correctly computes the N'th term using a loop to sum the squares:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_series(N):\n    sum_of_squares = 0\n    for i in range(N):\n        sum_of_squares += i * i\n    return sum_of_squares\n\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())\n    result = calculate_series(N)\n    print(result)\n```\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing the series and recognizing patterns, as well as the need to validate the derived formulas against sample outputs.",
    "reflection": "In this experience, I learned the importance of correctly identifying the underlying pattern in a mathematical series. Initially, I misinterpreted the series and used an incorrect formula based on the sum of squares, which led to incorrect outputs for certain test cases. The official solution, however, effectively derives the N'th term using a more direct mathematical formula.\n\nThe key insight from the official solution is the use of a specific formula to compute the N'th term directly, which is derived from the series properties. The formula used is:\n\n\\[ T(N) = \\frac{(N-2 + 1)(2(N-2) + 3)(N-2 + 2)}{6} \\]\n\nThis formula allows for efficient computation without the need for iterative summation, significantly improving performance, especially given the constraints where \\( N \\) can be as large as 10,000 and there can be up to 10,000 test cases.\n\nIn summary, the official solution is more efficient and concise, leveraging a mathematical approach to derive the result directly, while my initial approach was overly complex and incorrect. This experience reinforces the importance of thoroughly analyzing the problem and seeking patterns or formulas that can simplify the solution.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: calculate_series]\nThis function computes the sum of the squares of the first (N-1) integers, where N is the input parameter. It initializes a variable to hold the cumulative sum and iterates from 0 to N-1, adding the square of each integer to this sum. After completing the loop, it returns the total sum calculated. The function effectively provides the N'th term in a specific mathematical series based on the squares of integers. It is designed to handle a single input value and produce a corresponding output.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to compute specific terms in a mathematical series, particularly when the series is defined by a pattern involving the summation of squares. It can be applied in programming contests, algorithm design, and mathematical problem-solving where efficient computation of series terms is required, especially given constraints that allow for multiple test cases and large values of N."
