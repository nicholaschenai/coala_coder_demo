Each query specified a range of indices, and the goal was to return the sum of the values in that range for each query. The problem involved reading multiple test cases, processing a list of integers, and efficiently calculating sums based on given indices.\n\n    The solution involved iterating through each test case, reading the number of bills and queries, and then processing each query by summing the specified range of values.

The expected output required careful formatting, specifically ensuring that each test case's output was printed consecutively without extra blank lines, except for the required separation after each test case.\n\n    Initially, the code correctly generated the required patterns but failed to format the output correctly. The main issue was the handling of blank lines between test cases, which led to extra blank lines being printed. The expected output format required that there be no blank line after the last test case.\n\n    The solution involved iterating through each test case, generating the pattern for each K, and printing the lines immediately. A conditional check was added to print a blank line only if the current test case was not the last one. This adjustment ensured that the output adhered to the expected format.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final working code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def generate_pattern(T):\n        for t in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case\n            K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case\n            for i in range(K):  # For each line from 0 to K-1\n                line = \"\"  # Initialize an empty line\n                for j in range(i, -1, -1):  # Create the line by counting down from i to 0\n                    line += str(j)  # Append the current number to the line\n                print(line)  # Print the generated line\n            if t < T - 1:  # If this is not the last test case, print a blank line\n                print()  # Print a blank line to separate test cases\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    generate_pattern(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of output formatting in programming challenges, as even minor discrepancies can lead to test failures.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The relationship between the number of particles at time `t` and `t-1` is defined by the factorial function, leading to the formula `N! * X`. Given the constraints where `N` can be as large as \\(10^{18}\\), direct computation of `N!` is impractical. \n\n    The key insight was recognizing that if `N` is greater than or equal to \\(10^6 + 3\\), the result would be `0` due to the factorial containing that modulus as a factor. For smaller values of `N`, I implemented a function to compute `N!` modulo \\(10^6 + 3\\). \n\n    The final solution involved two main functions: one for calculating the factorial modulo a number and another for determining the number of particles based on the input values.
