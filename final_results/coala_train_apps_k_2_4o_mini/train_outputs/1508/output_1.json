    "raw_msg": "Here is the corrected Python code that generates the required pattern based on the input integer K for multiple test cases. This version ensures that there are no extra blank lines between the outputs of different test cases.\n\n```python\ndef generate_pattern(T):\n    results = []  # List to store all the results for each test case\n    for _ in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case\n        K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case\n        for i in range(K):  # For each line from 0 to K-1\n            line = \"\"  # Initialize an empty line\n            for j in range(i, -1, -1):  # Create the line by counting down from i to 0\n                line += str(j)  # Append the current number to the line\n            results.append(line)  # Store the generated line in results\n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))  # Print all results at once, separated by new lines\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ngenerate_pattern(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases\n```\n\n### Key Changes Made:\n- The code now collects all lines in a list called `results` and prints them all at once at the end, ensuring that there are no extra blank lines between test cases.\n- This approach adheres to the expected output format as specified in the problem statement.",
