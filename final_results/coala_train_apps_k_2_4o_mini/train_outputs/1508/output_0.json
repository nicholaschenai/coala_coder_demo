    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The task is to generate a specific pattern based on an integer input K for multiple test cases. For each test case, we need to print a pattern of numbers that starts from 0 and goes up to K, with each line containing a sequence of numbers that decreases from the current line number down to 0.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - Read the number of test cases, T.\n   - For each test case, read the integer K.\n   - For each integer from 0 to K-1 (inclusive), generate a line of numbers starting from the current integer down to 0.\n   - Print each line of the pattern for the current test case, ensuring to separate patterns of different test cases with a blank line.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function generate_pattern(T):\n       for each test case from 1 to T:\n           read K\n           for i from 0 to K-1:\n               line = \"\"\n               for j from i down to 0:\n                   line += j\n               print line\n           if not the last test case:\n               print a blank line\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef generate_pattern(T):\n    for _ in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case\n        K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case\n        for i in range(K):  # For each line from 0 to K-1\n            line = \"\"  # Initialize an empty line\n            for j in range(i, -1, -1):  # Create the line by counting down from i to 0\n                line += str(j)  # Append the current number to the line\n            print(line)  # Print the generated line\n        if _ < T - 1:  # If this is not the last test case, print a blank line\n            print()  # Print a blank line to separate test cases\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ngenerate_pattern(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases\n```",
