    "raw_msg": "Here is the corrected Python code that generates the required pattern based on the input integer K for multiple test cases. This version ensures that the output format adheres to the expected results, with proper handling of blank lines between test cases.\n\n```python\ndef generate_pattern(T):\n    for t in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case\n        K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case\n        for i in range(K):  # For each line from 0 to K-1\n            line = \"\"  # Initialize an empty line\n            for j in range(i, -1, -1):  # Create the line by counting down from i to 0\n                line += str(j)  # Append the current number to the line\n            print(line)  # Print the generated line\n        if t < T - 1:  # If this is not the last test case, print a blank line\n            print()  # Print a blank line to separate test cases\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ngenerate_pattern(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases\n```\n\n### Key Changes Made:\n- The code now correctly prints each line for the current test case immediately after generating it.\n- A blank line is printed only after each test case's output, except for the last test case, ensuring the output format matches the expected results. \n\nThis should now pass all tests and produce the correct output format as specified in the problem statement.",
