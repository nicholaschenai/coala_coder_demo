Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \\log n)$.\n    We want something better though.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution\n\n    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.\n\n    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}\n    n\\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\\n    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\\\\n    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = \\left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \\bmod n \\right) + 1$$\n\n    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$\n\n    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\bmod n$$\n\n    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Non-recursive form** :\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)\n      \t  res = (res + k) % i;\n        return res + 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This formula can also be found analytically.\n    Again here we assume 0-indexing.\n    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.\n    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \\bmod n$.\n    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\ \\bmod n$.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(k \\log n)$ solution\n\n    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.\n    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$) in one run without looping over.\n    Afterwards we have $n - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k)$-th number.\n    So we have to shift by that many.\n    We can notice that $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k$ is simply $-n \\bmod k$.\n    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.\n    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.\n\n    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.\n\n    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        if (n == 1)\n            return 0;\n        if (k == 1)\n            return n-1;\n        if (k > n)\n            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;\n        int cnt = n / k;\n        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);\n        res -= n % k;\n        if (res < 0)\n            res += n;\n        else\n            res += res / (k - 1);\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:\n\n    $$ n \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) ^ x = 1, $$\n\n    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:\n\n    $$\\ln n + x \\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) = 0,$$ \n    $$x = - \\frac{\\ln n}{\\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)},$$\n\n    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:\n\n    $$x \\approx k \\ln n$$\n\n    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \\log n)$.\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$\n\n    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.\n\n    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):\n\n    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$\n\n    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:\n\n    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$\n\n    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, \"restarting\" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:\n\n    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \\left(n-2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor} \\right)$$\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$\n\n    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler \"The Josephus Problem\" and Odlyzko, Wilf \"Functional iteration and the Josephus problem\").\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution provided is concise and leverages a mathematical approach to efficiently calculate the sum of multiples of 10. Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n    1. **Mathematical Simplification**: The official solution first reduces the input number \\( N \\) to the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to \\( N \\) by using `n -= n % 10`. This step ensures that we only consider relevant multiples of 10.\n\n    2. **Count of Multiples**: The solution then calculates how many multiples of 10 exist up to \\( N \\) by dividing \\( N \\) by 10. This is done with `n /= 10`, which effectively counts the multiples of 10.\n\n    3. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first \\( k \\) multiples of 10 can be derived from the formula for the sum of the first \\( k \\) natural numbers, scaled by 10. The formula used is `print(n * (n + 1) / 2 * 10)`, which computes the sum of the first \\( n \\) integers and multiplies it by 10 to get the sum of the multiples of 10.\n\n    4. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient, operating in constant time \\( O(1) \\) for each test case, as it uses direct arithmetic operations rather than iterating through numbers.\n\n    In contrast, my initial approach involved more steps and checks, which could be simplified. The official solution's use of direct arithmetic operations not only makes it more elegant but also reduces the potential for errors and improves performance, especially given the constraints where \\( N \\) can be as large as 1 billion. \n\n    Overall, this experience highlights the importance of leveraging mathematical properties to simplify problems, especially when dealing with large numbers.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

This avoids the overhead of recursive function calls and stack management, making it more efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.\n\n2. **Handling Odd Numbers**: The official solution introduces a more nuanced way to handle odd numbers.
