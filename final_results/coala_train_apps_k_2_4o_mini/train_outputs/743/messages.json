He ordered $N$ apples, where $N$ is a multiple of $K$. Now, he just needs to hire someone who will distribute the apples into the boxes with professional passion. \nOnly two candidates passed all the interviews for the box filling job. In one minute, each candidate can put $K$ apples into boxes, but they do it in different ways: the first candidate puts exactly one apple in each box, while the second one chooses a random box with the smallest number of apples and puts $K$ apples in it.\nChef is wondering if the final distribution of apples can even depend on which candidate he hires. Can you answer that question?\nNote: The boxes are distinguishable (labeled), while the apples are not. Therefore, two distributions of apples are different if there is a box such that the number of apples in it when the first candidate finishes working can be different from the number of apples in it when the second candidate finishes working.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. \n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string \"YES\" if the final distributions of apples can be different or \"NO\" if they will be the same (without quotes).\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 250$\n- $1 \\le N, K \\le 10^{18}$\n- $N$ is divisible by $K$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (30 points): $1 \\le N, K \\le 10^5$\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n-----Example Input-----\n3\n5 1\n4 2\n10 10\n\n-----Example Output-----\nNO\nNO\nYES\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1: No matter who is hired, all apples will be in the only box at the end.\nExample case 2: At the end, there will be two apples in each box.\nExample case 3: If we hire the first candidate, there will be one apple in each box, but if we hire the second one, there will be $10$ apples in one box and none in all other boxes.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

There are two candidates who can help with this task. The first candidate distributes the apples evenly, putting one apple in each box until all apples are distributed. The second candidate puts all K apples into the box that currently has the least number of apples. The question is whether the final distribution of apples in the boxes can be different depending on which candidate is hired.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To determine if the final distributions can differ, we need to analyze how each candidate distributes the apples:\n   - The first candidate will always distribute the apples evenly across all boxes, resulting in each box having the same number of apples.\n   - The second candidate, however, may end up putting all apples into one box if K equals N, or may distribute them unevenly if K is less than N. \n   Therefore, if K equals N, the second candidate will fill one box completely, while the first candidate will distribute them evenly.

The key points to consider were whether the total demand from the minions matched \\( K \\), was less than \\( K \\), or exceeded \\( K \\).\n\n    Initially, the approach focused on checking if the total demand equaled \\( K \\) and incorrectly assumed that if the total demand was less than \\( K \\), Gru could always distribute the remaining money. This led to incorrect outputs, particularly in cases where the remaining money could not be distributed without exceeding individual demands.\n\n    The correct logic should have been:\n    1. If the total demand equals \\( K \\), print \"YES\".\n    2. If the total demand is less than \\( K \\), print \"YES\" since Gru can distribute the remaining money.\n    3. If the total demand exceeds \\( K \\), print \"NO\".\n\n    Despite multiple attempts to refine the logic, the solution consistently failed to account for the distribution constraints properly. The final code snippet aimed to address these issues but still produced incorrect results, indicating a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.\n\n    ### Key Takeaways:\n    - Ensure to fully understand the constraints of distribution when dealing with remaining amounts.\n    - Always validate the logic against edge cases to ensure correctness.\n    - The problem highlighted the importance of careful condition checking in scenarios involving sums and distributions. \n\n    ### Final Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            K = case[1]\n            demands = case[2]\n            total_demand = sum(demands)\n        \n            if total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            elif total_demand < K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        demands = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, demands))\n\n    can_distribute_money(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the core concepts, strategies attempted, and the errors encountered during the problem-solving process.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host given the number of problems created by his setters, the number of problems required for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the number of days available to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for summation and list handling.\n\n    The final implementation successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code was structured to first read input values, process each test case, and then output the results. Key strategies included using integer division to determine the number of contests and the `min` function to ensure the result did not exceed the available days. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of clear problem breakdown and efficient use of built-in functions in Python. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n            A = case[3]\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))\n\n    max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"

For example, in logistics, understanding how different strategies for distributing items (like apples in this case) can lead to different results is crucial for optimizing processes. This can also apply to scenarios in operations research, game theory, or any situation where resources are allocated among distinguishable entities and the method of allocation can affect the final distribution."
