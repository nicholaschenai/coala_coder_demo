    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   Chef has a certain number of apples (N) that he wants to distribute into a number of boxes (K). There are two candidates who can help with this distribution. The first candidate distributes the apples evenly, putting one apple in each box until all apples are distributed. The second candidate puts all K apples into the box that currently has the least number of apples. The task is to determine if the final distribution of apples can be different depending on which candidate is hired.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To determine if the final distributions can differ, we need to analyze how each candidate distributes the apples:\n   - The first candidate will always distribute the apples evenly across all boxes, resulting in each box having the same number of apples.\n   - The second candidate, however, may end up putting all apples into one box if K equals N, or may create an uneven distribution if K is less than N. \n   Therefore, if K is equal to N, the second candidate will also end up with an even distribution (all apples in one box), but if K is less than N, the distributions can differ. \n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           N, K = test_case\n           if K == N:\n               print \"YES\"\n           else if K < N:\n               print \"NO\"\n           else:\n               print \"NO\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):\n    # Iterate through each test case\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N, K = case  # Unpack the number of apples and boxes\n        # Check if the number of boxes is equal to the number of apples\n        if K == N:\n            print(\"YES\")  # Both candidates will have the same distribution\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")  # The distributions can differ\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\n# Read each test case\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    test_cases.append((N, K))  # Store the test case as a tuple\n\n# Call the function with the number of test cases and the list of test cases\ncan_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)\n```",
