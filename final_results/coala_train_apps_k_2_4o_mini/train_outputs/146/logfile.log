- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.


The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.


You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].


Examples:

s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        
```

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to decode a string that contains encoded patterns. The encoding format is `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times to repeat the `encoded_string` that follows it inside square brackets. Our task is to return the fully decoded string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To decode the string, we can use a stack to keep track of the characters and numbers as we parse through the string. When we encounter a digit, we build the number until we hit a `[`, at which point we push the number and the current string onto the stack. When we encounter a `]`, we pop from the stack to get the last number and string, repeat the string that many times, and append it to the string we are currently building. This process continues until we have processed the entire input string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize an empty stack
   Initialize an empty current_string
   Initialize a number variable to 0

   For each character in the input string:
       If the character is a digit:
           Update the number (build the complete number)
       Else if the character is '[':
           Push the current_string and the number onto the stack
           Reset current_string and number
       Else if the character is ']':
           Pop the number and the last string from the stack
           Repeat current_string the number of times and append to the last string
           Update current_string to this new string
       Else:
           Append the character to current_string

   Return current_string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of numbers and strings

        number = 0

        for char in s:
            if char.isdigit():
                # Build the number (could be more than one digit)
                number = number * 10 + int(char)
            elif char == '[':
                # Push the current string and number onto the stack
                stack.append((current_string, number))
                # Reset current_string and number for the new segment
                current_string = ""
                number = 0
            elif char == ']':
                # Pop the last string and number from the stack
                last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()
                # Repeat the current_string and append to the last string
                current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count
            else:
                # Append the character to the current_string
                current_string += char
        
        # Return the fully decoded string

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
           The task is to generate a specific pattern of numbers based on an integer input K for multiple test cases. For each test case, we need to print a pattern where each line contains a sequence of numbers that starts from 0 and goes up to the current line number, with each line printed consecutively.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
           - Read the number of test cases, T.
           - For each test case, read the integer K.
           - For each integer from 0 to K-1 (inclusive), generate a line of numbers starting from the current integer down to 0.
           - Print each line of the pattern for the current test case, ensuring to separate patterns of different test cases with a blank line, but not after the last test case.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
           ```
           function generate_pattern(T):
               for each test case from 1 to T:
                   read K
                   for i from 0 to K-1:
                       line = ""
                       for j from i down to 0:
                           line += j
                       print line

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to decode a string that contains encoded patterns. The encoding format is `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times the `encoded_string` should be repeated. The goal is to return the fully decoded string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We need to traverse the string character by character.
   - When we encounter a digit, we need to determine the full number (which could be more than one digit).
   - When we encounter an opening bracket `[`, we need to push the current number and the current decoded string onto a stack.
   - When we encounter a closing bracket `]`, we pop from the stack to get the last number and the last decoded string, then repeat the current string that many times and append it to the last decoded string.
   - Finally, we return the fully decoded string.

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to decode a string that contains encoded patterns. The encoding format is `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times the `encoded_string` should be repeated. The goal is to return the fully decoded string.

   - When we encounter a closing bracket `]`, we pop from the stack to get the last number and the last decoded string, then repeat the current string that many times and append it to the last decoded string.
   - Finally, we return the fully decoded string.

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] The problem involved decoding a string formatted with patterns like `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times the `encoded_string` should be repeated. The solution required careful traversal of the string, handling digits, brackets, and characters appropriately.

Key concepts included using a stack to manage nested structures and building the current number and string dynamically as we parsed the input. The approach effectively handled multiple digits and nested encodings by pushing the current state onto the stack when encountering an opening bracket and popping it when encountering a closing bracket.

The final implementation successfully decoded the string by iterating through each character, updating the current number and string, and utilizing the stack to manage the context of nested encodings. The code snippet provided was:

```python
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []  # Initialize a stack to keep track of numbers and strings
        current_num = 0  # To build the current number
        current_string = ""  # To build the current decoded string

        for char in s:  # Iterate through each character in the string
            if char.isdigit():  # Check if the character is a digit
                current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)  # Build the number
            elif char == '[':  # Check for opening bracket
                stack.append((current_string, current_num))  # Push current string and number onto stack
                current_string = ""  # Reset current string
                current_num = 0  # Reset current number
            elif char == ']':  # Check for closing bracket
                last_string, num = stack.pop()  # Pop from stack
                current_string = last_string + current_string * num  # Repeat current string and append
            else:  # If it's a regular character
                current_string += char  # Append the character to the current string

        return current_string  # Return the fully decoded string
```

The solution passed all tests, indicating that the approach was effective and correctly implemented. No unexpected errors were encountered during the process.

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] The official solution effectively utilizes a stack to manage the decoding of the string, which is a common approach for problems involving nested structures like brackets. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Stack Initialization**: The stack is initialized with a base case of an empty string and a multiplier of 1. This allows for easy concatenation of strings as we decode.

2. **Building Numbers**: Instead of maintaining a separate variable for the current number, the official solution builds the number as a string (`num`) and converts it to an integer only when needed. This avoids potential issues with resetting the number prematurely.

3. **Handling Brackets**: When encountering an opening bracket `[`, the current string and the number are pushed onto the stack. This allows for a clean separation of contexts when nested structures are present.

4. **Decoding Logic**: Upon encountering a closing bracket `]`, the solution pops the last string and multiplier from the stack and appends the repeated string to the previous context. This ensures that the decoded string is built correctly in the right order.

5. **Final Output**: The final decoded string is simply the first element of the stack after processing all characters, which is efficient and straightforward.

In contrast, my initial approach was similar but had some inefficiencies, particularly in how I managed the current number and string. The official solution's method of handling the number as a string until it was needed for conversion is more elegant and reduces the risk of errors. Additionally, the use of `stack[-1][0]` for appending characters directly to the last string in the stack is a cleaner approach than managing multiple variables for the current string. 

Overall, the official solution is concise and effectively handles the problem's requirements, demonstrating a solid understanding of stack operations in the context of string manipulation.
INFO - Updated entry: The problem involved decoding a string formatted with patterns like `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times the `encoded_string` should be repeated.

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] This function decodes a string that contains encoded patterns in the format of numbers followed by brackets, where the number indicates how many times the string inside the brackets should be repeated. It uses a stack to keep track of the current string and the number of repetitions as it processes each character in the input string. When a digit is encountered, it builds the current number, and when an opening bracket is found, it saves the current string and number onto the stack. Upon encountering a closing bracket, it pops the last string and number from the stack, repeats the current string accordingly, and appends it to the last string. Regular characters are simply added to the current string as they are processed. Finally, the function returns the fully decoded string.

[Problem]
    Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.


    The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.


    You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

    Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].


    Examples:

    s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
    s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
    s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".
