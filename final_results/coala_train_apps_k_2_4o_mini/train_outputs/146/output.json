    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The task is to decode a string that contains encoded patterns. The encoding format is `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times the `encoded_string` should be repeated. The goal is to return the fully decoded string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - We need to traverse the string character by character.\n   - When we encounter a digit, we need to determine the full number (which could be more than one digit).\n   - When we encounter an opening bracket `[`, we need to push the current number and the current decoded string onto a stack.\n   - When we encounter a closing bracket `]`, we pop from the stack to get the last number and the last decoded string, then repeat the current string that many times and append it to the last decoded string.\n   - Finally, we return the fully decoded string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function decodeString(s):\n       stack = []  # Initialize a stack to keep track of numbers and strings\n       current_num = 0  # To build the current number\n       current_string = \"\"  # To build the current decoded string\n\n       for char in s:\n           if char is a digit:\n               current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)  # Build the number\n           elif char is '[':\n               stack.append((current_string, current_num))  # Push current string and number onto stack\n               current_string = \"\"  # Reset current string\n               current_num = 0  # Reset current number\n           elif char is ']':\n               last_string, num = stack.pop()  # Pop from stack\n               current_string = last_string + current_string * num  # Repeat current string and append\n           else:\n               current_string += char  # Append the character to the current string\n\n       return current_string  # Return the fully decoded string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:\n        stack = []  # Initialize a stack to keep track of numbers and strings\n        current_num = 0  # To build the current number\n        current_string = \"\"  # To build the current decoded string\n\n        for char in s:  # Iterate through each character in the string\n            if char.isdigit():  # Check if the character is a digit\n                current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)  # Build the number\n            elif char == '[':  # Check for opening bracket\n                stack.append((current_string, current_num))  # Push current string and number onto stack\n                current_string = \"\"  # Reset current string\n                current_num = 0  # Reset current number\n            elif char == ']':  # Check for closing bracket\n                last_string, num = stack.pop()  # Pop from stack\n                current_string = last_string + current_string * num  # Repeat current string and append\n            else:  # If it's a regular character\n                current_string += char  # Append the character to the current string\n\n        return current_string  # Return the fully decoded string\n```",
