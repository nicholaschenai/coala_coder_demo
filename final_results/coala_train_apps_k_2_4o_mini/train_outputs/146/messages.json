Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.\n\n\nYou may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.\n\nFurthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].\n\n\nExamples:\n\ns = \"3[a]2[bc]\", return \"aaabcbc\".\ns = \"3[a2[c]]\", return \"accaccacc\".\ns = \"2[abc]3[cd]ef\", return \"abcabccdcdcdef\".\n\nThe output code needs to use the provided function signature\n\nThe final python function should begin with: \n```python\n\nclass Solution:\n    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:\n        \n```\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to decode a string that contains encoded patterns. The encoding format is `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times to repeat the `encoded_string` that follows it inside square brackets. Our task is to return the fully decoded string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To decode the string, we can use a stack to keep track of the characters and numbers as we parse through the string. When we encounter a digit, we build the number until we hit a `[`, at which point we push the number and the current string onto the stack. When we encounter a `]`, we pop from the stack to get the last number and string, repeat the string that many times, and append it to the string we are currently building. This process continues until we have processed the entire input string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Initialize an empty stack\n   Initialize an empty current_string\n   Initialize a number variable to 0\n\n   For each character in the input string:\n       If the character is a digit:\n           Update the number (build the complete number)\n       Else if the character is '[':\n           Push the current_string and the number onto the stack\n           Reset current_string and number\n       Else if the character is ']':\n           Pop the number and the last string from the stack\n           Repeat current_string the number of times and append to the last string\n           Update current_string to this new string\n       Else:\n           Append the character to current_string\n\n   Return current_string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:\n        # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of numbers and strings\n        stack = []\n        current_string = \"\"\n        number = 0\n        \n        # Iterate through each character in the input string\n        for char in s:\n            if char.isdigit():\n                # Build the number (could be more than one digit)\n                number = number * 10 + int(char)\n            elif char == '[':\n                # Push the current string and number onto the stack\n                stack.append((current_string, number))\n                # Reset current_string and number for the new segment\n                current_string = \"\"\n                number = 0\n            elif char == ']':\n                # Pop the last string and number from the stack\n                last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()\n                # Repeat the current_string and append to the last string\n                current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count\n            else:\n                # Append the character to the current_string\n                current_string += char\n        \n        # Return the fully decoded string\n        return current_string\n```"

        "content": "The official solution effectively utilizes a stack to manage the decoding of the string, which is a common approach for problems involving nested structures like brackets. Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Stack Initialization**: The stack is initialized with a base case of an empty string and a multiplier of 1. This allows for easy concatenation of strings as we decode.\n\n2. **Building Numbers**: Instead of maintaining a separate variable for the current number, the official solution builds the number as a string (`num`) and converts it to an integer only when needed. This avoids potential issues with resetting the number prematurely.\n\n3. **Handling Brackets**: When encountering an opening bracket `[`, the current string and the number are pushed onto the stack. This allows for a clean separation of contexts when nested structures are present.\n\n4. **Decoding Logic**: Upon encountering a closing bracket `]`, the solution pops the last string and multiplier from the stack and appends the repeated string to the previous context. This ensures that the decoded string is built correctly in the right order.\n\n5. **Final Output**: The final decoded string is simply the first element of the stack after processing all characters, which is efficient and straightforward.\n\nIn contrast, my initial approach was similar but had some inefficiencies, particularly in how I managed the current number and string. The official solution's method of handling the number as a string until it was needed for conversion is more elegant and reduces the risk of errors. Additionally, the use of `stack[-1][0]` for appending characters directly to the last string in the stack is a cleaner approach than managing multiple variables for the current string. \n\nOverall, the official solution is concise and effectively handles the problem's requirements, demonstrating a solid understanding of stack operations in the context of string manipulation."

        "content": "\n[description]\nThis function decodes a string that contains encoded patterns in the format of numbers followed by brackets, where the number indicates how many times the string inside the brackets should be repeated. It uses a stack to keep track of the current string and the number of repetitions as it processes each character in the input string. When a digit is encountered, it builds the current number, and when an opening bracket is found, it saves the current string and number onto the stack. Upon encountering a closing bracket, it pops the last string and number from the stack, repeats the current string accordingly, and appends it to the last string. Regular characters are simply added to the current string as they are processed. Finally, the function returns the fully decoded string.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to decode strings that follow a specific encoding pattern, such as in data compression, parsing encoded messages, or handling input formats in programming contests. It can also be applied in situations where you need to manipulate or transform strings based on defined rules, such as in text processing applications or when implementing custom serialization/deserialization logic."
