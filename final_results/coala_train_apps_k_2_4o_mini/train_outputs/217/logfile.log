For every (contiguous) subarray B =Â [A[i], A[i+1], ..., A[j]] (with i <= j), we take the bitwise OR of all the elements in B, obtaining a result A[i] | A[i+1] | ... | A[j].
Return the number of possibleÂ results.Â  (Results that occur more than once are only counted once in the final answer.)
Â 

Example 1:
Input: [0]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
There is only one possible result: 0.


Example 2:
Input: [1,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The possible subarrays are [1], [1], [2], [1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 1, 2].
These yield the results 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3.
There are 3 unique values, so the answer is 3.

INFO - [Task id] 217 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have an array of non-negative integers, and we need to find the number of unique results obtained by taking the bitwise OR of all possible contiguous subarrays. A subarray is any continuous segment of the array. We only count each unique result once, even if it appears multiple times.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and for each starting index, calculate the bitwise OR for all possible ending indices. We can keep track of the results using a set, which automatically handles duplicates for us. The bitwise OR operation combines bits from the numbers, and as we extend the subarray, the result can only stay the same or increase (it never decreases). Thus, we can efficiently compute the results without recalculating from scratch for overlapping subarrays.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize an empty set to store unique results
   Initialize a variable to keep track of the current OR value
   For each starting index i in the array:
       Set current OR to 0
       For each ending index j from i to the end of the array:
           Update current OR with the bitwise OR of current OR and A[j]
           Add current OR to the set of results
   Return the size of the set as the final answer
   ```

        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
           We need to find the shortest string that can contain all the given strings as substrings. The strings in the input list are guaranteed not to be substrings of one another.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
           To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach to generate all possible permutations of the input strings. For each permutation, we will merge the strings together while ensuring that we only add the necessary characters to maintain the substring property. We will keep track of the shortest merged string found during this process.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function shortestSuperstring(A):

                   if shortest_string is empty or length of merged_string < length of shortest_string:
                       shortest_string = merged_string
               return shortest_string

           function merge_strings(strings):
               start with the first string as merged
               for each string in strings starting from the second:
                   overlap = find_max_overlap(merged, string)
                   add the non-overlapping part of string to merged
               return merged

           function find_max_overlap(s1, s2):
               max_overlap = 0
               for i from 1 to length of s1:
                   if s1[i:] is equal to s2[:length of s1 - i]:
                       max_overlap = length of s1 - i

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to calculate the maximum strength of an army formed by selecting a non-empty subsequence of PokÃ©mon strengths, where the strength is defined as an alternating sum. The alternating sum is calculated as \( a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \ldots \).

    Initially, I attempted to solve the problem by sorting the strengths in descending order and calculating the alternating sum based on the sorted order. However, this approach did not yield the correct results because it failed to account for the optimal selection of PokÃ©mon to maximize the alternating sum.

    The correct strategy involves sorting the strengths and then iterating through the sorted list, adding strengths at odd indices and subtracting strengths at even indices. This ensures that the largest strengths contribute positively to the sum while minimizing the negative contributions from the smaller strengths.

    Despite multiple attempts to refine the solution, the implementation consistently failed to produce the expected output, indicating a deeper issue with the approach or logic. The final implementation aimed to collect results and print them in one go to optimize output handling, but it still did not resolve the underlying problem.

    Key takeaways:
    - The alternating sum requires careful selection of elements based on their contribution to the total.
    - Sorting the strengths is essential, but the logic for calculating the alternating sum must be correctly implemented.
    - Efficient input and output handling can improve performance, especially with larger datasets. 

    The final code snippet that was attempted is as follows:

    ```python
    def max_strength(t, test_cases):
        results = []
        for case in test_cases:
            n = case[0]  # Number of PokÃ©mon
            a = case[1]  # List of strengths
        
            # Sort the strengths in descending order
            a.sort(reverse=True)
        
            max_strength = 0
        
            # Calculate the maximum alternating sum
            for i in range(n):
                if i % 2 == 0:  # Odd position in terms of 1-based index (0, 2, 4... in 0-based)
                    max_strength += a[i]
                else:  # Even position in terms of 1-based index (1, 3, 5... in 0-based)
                    max_strength -= a[i]
        
            results.append(max_strength)  # Store the maximum strength for this test case

        # Print all results at once
        for result in results:
            print(result)
    ``` 

    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and ensuring that the logic aligns with the mathematical principles involved in the solution.

The bitwise OR operation accumulates values, meaning that once we compute the OR for a starting index, we can extend it to the next index without needing to recompute from scratch.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function subarrayBitwiseORs(A):
       initialize a set to store unique results
       initialize a list to keep track of current OR results
       
       for each element in A:
           initialize a new list for the current OR results
           for each result in the previous OR results:
               calculate the new OR with the current element
               add the new OR to the current results
           add the current element to the current results
           add all current results to the unique results set
           update the previous results to the current results

INFO - [Task id] 217 [generation text] The problem involved calculating the number of unique results from the bitwise OR of all contiguous subarrays of a given array of non-negative integers. The key insight was that the bitwise OR operation accumulates values, allowing us to build upon previous results without recomputing from scratch.

The solution utilized a set to store unique results and a list to track current OR results as we iterated through the array. For each element, we computed the new OR values based on the previous results and added them to the set for uniqueness. This approach effectively handled the constraints of the problem, ensuring that we could manage up to 50,000 elements efficiently.

The final implementation was straightforward and passed the provided test cases, confirming its correctness. The code snippet is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: list[int]) -> int:
        unique_results = set()
        current_results = []
        
        for num in A:
            new_results = []
            for result in current_results:
                new_or = result | num
                new_results.append(new_or)
                unique_results.add(new_or)
            new_results.append(num)
            unique_results.add(num)
            current_results = new_results
        
        return len(unique_results)
```

This experience reinforced the importance of understanding bitwise operations and their properties, particularly in the context of accumulating results over iterations.

## Official solution
class Solution:
    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        res = set()
        cur = set()
        for a in A:
            cur = {a | i for i in cur}
            cur |= {a}
            res |= cur
        return len(res)

INFO - [Task id] 217 [generation text] The official solution provides a more efficient approach to solving the problem of counting unique bitwise OR results from subarrays. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Use of Sets**: The official solution utilizes sets to maintain unique results, which is similar to my approach. However, it initializes the `cur` set directly with the bitwise OR results, which is more concise and efficient.

2. **Current Results Calculation**: Instead of maintaining a list of current results, the official solution uses a set comprehension to calculate the new OR results in a single line. This reduces the overhead of managing a list and simplifies the code.

3. **Combining Results**: The official solution combines the current results with the overall results using set union operations (`|=`), which is both clear and efficient.

4. **Efficiency**: The official solution avoids unnecessary iterations and directly updates the current results set, which likely improves performance, especially for larger input sizes.

In contrast, my initial approach involved maintaining a list for current results and iterating through it, which could lead to increased time complexity. The official solution's use of set comprehensions and direct updates makes it more elegant and efficient. 

Overall, the official solution is a good reminder of the power of using sets for uniqueness and the benefits of concise code through comprehensions in Python.
