    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   Indraneel has a collection of books numbered from 1 to N, arranged in a certain order on a shelf. He wants to rearrange them in ascending order (1, 2, ..., N) using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can take any book and place it in a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of such moves required to sort the books.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we can identify the longest subsequence of books that are already in the correct order. The books that are not part of this subsequence will need to be moved. The minimum number of moves required to sort the shelf will be equal to the total number of books minus the length of this longest ordered subsequence. We can find this subsequence using a dynamic programming approach or a more efficient method using binary search.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function min_moves_to_sort(N, books):\n       # Create an array to store the position of each book\n       position = array of size N+1 initialized to 0\n       for i from 0 to N-1:\n           position[books[i]] = i  # Store the index of each book\n\n       # Initialize variables to find the longest increasing subsequence\n       longest_increasing_length = 0\n       current_length = 0\n\n       # Iterate through the books in order\n       for i from 1 to N:\n           if position[i] > position[i-1]:\n               current_length += 1\n           else:\n               longest_increasing_length = max(longest_increasing_length, current_length)\n               current_length = 1  # Reset for the new subsequence\n\n       # Final check for the last subsequence\n       longest_increasing_length = max(longest_increasing_length, current_length)\n\n       # The minimum moves required is total books minus the length of the longest increasing subsequence\n       return N - (longest_increasing_length + 1)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef min_moves_to_sort(N, books):\n    # Create an array to store the position of each book\n    position = [0] * (N + 1)\n    for i in range(N):\n        position[books[i]] = i  # Store the index of each book\n\n    # Initialize variables to find the longest increasing subsequence\n    longest_increasing_length = 0\n    current_length = 0\n\n    # Iterate through the books in order\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        if position[i] > position[i - 1]:\n            current_length += 1\n        else:\n            longest_increasing_length = max(longest_increasing_length, current_length)\n            current_length = 1  # Reset for the new subsequence\n\n    # Final check for the last subsequence\n    longest_increasing_length = max(longest_increasing_length, current_length)\n\n    # The minimum moves required is total books minus the length of the longest increasing subsequence\n    return N - (longest_increasing_length + 1)\n\n# Read input\nN = int(input())\nbooks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Output the result\nprint(min_moves_to_sort(N, books))\n```",
