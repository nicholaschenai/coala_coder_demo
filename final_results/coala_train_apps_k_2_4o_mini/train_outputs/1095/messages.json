Here is an example for a $5 \\times 5$ chessboard.\n\n    $$\\begin{matrix}\n    \\bf{1} & 2 & \\bf{5} & 6 & \\bf{9} \\\\\\\n    2 & \\bf{5} & 6 & \\bf{9} & 8 \\\\\\\n    \\bf{5} & 6 & \\bf{9} & 8 & \\bf{7} \\\\\\\n    6 & \\bf{9} & 8 & \\bf{7} & 4 \\\\\\\n    \\bf{9} & 8 & \\bf{7} & 4 & \\bf{3} \\\\\\\n    \\end{matrix}$$\n\n    Let `D[i][j]` denote the number of ways to place `j` bishops on diagonals with indices up to `i` which have the same color as diagonal `i`.\n    Then `i = 1...2N-1` and `j = 0...K`.\n\n    We can calculate `D[i][j]` using only values of `D[i-2]` (we subtract 2 because we only consider diagonals of the same color as $i$).\n    There are two ways to get `D[i][j]`.\n    Either we place all `j` bishops on previous diagonals: then there are `D[i-2][j]` ways to achieve this.\n    Or we place one bishop on diagonal `i` and `j-1` bishops on previous diagonals.\n    The number of ways to do this equals the number of squares in diagonal `i` minus `j-1`, because each of `j-1` bishops placed on previous diagonals will block one square on the current diagonal.\n    The number of squares in diagonal `i` can be calculated as follows:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int squares (int i) {\n        if (i & 1)\n            return i / 4 * 2 + 1;\n        else\n            return (i - 1) / 4 * 2 + 2;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The base case is simple: `D[i][0] = 1`, `D[1][1] = 1`.\n\n    Once we have calculated all values of `D[i][j]`, the answer can be obtained as follows:\n    consider all possible numbers of bishops placed on black diagonals `i=0...K`, with corresponding numbers of bishops on white diagonals `K-i`.\n    The bishops placed on black and white diagonals never attack each other, so the placements can be done independently.\n    The index of the last black diagonal is `2N-1`, the last white one is `2N-2`.\n    For each `i` we add `D[2N-1][i] * D[2N-2][K-i]` to the answer.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    ```cpp\n    int bishop_placements(int N, int K)\n    {\n        if (K > 2 * N - 1)\n            return 0;\n\n        vector<vector<int>> D(N * 2, vector<int>(K + 1));\n        for (int i = 0; i < N * 2; ++i)\n            D[i][0] = 1;\n        D[1][1] = 1;\n        for (int i = 2; i < N * 2; ++i)\n            for (int j = 1; j <= K; ++j)\n                D[i][j] = D[i-2][j] + D[i-2][j-1] * (squares(i) - j + 1);\n\n        int ans = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i <= K; ++i)\n            ans += D[N*2-1][i] * D[N*2-2][K-i];\n        return ans;\n    }\n    ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involves determining the smallest possible weight of a remaining rock after a series of smash operations on a collection of rocks with positive integer weights. The key insight is that this can be framed as a dynamic programming problem similar to the subset sum problem, where the goal is to partition the rocks into two groups with minimal weight difference.\n\n    The solution involves calculating the total weight of the rocks and using a boolean array to track achievable sums up to half of that total weight. By iterating through each rock and updating the achievable sums, we can find the largest sum that can be formed, which helps in determining the minimum weight of the last remaining rock.\n\n    The final implementation successfully passed the provided test case, demonstrating that the approach is effective. The code efficiently computes the result without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints of the problem. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:\n            total_weight = sum(stones)\n            target = total_weight // 2\n        \n            dp = [False] * (target + 1)\n            dp[0] = True\n        \n            for weight in stones:\n                for j in range(target, weight - 1, -1):\n                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - weight]\n        \n            for j in range(target, -1, -1):\n                if dp[j]:\n                    return total_weight - 2 * j\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the core concepts, the strategy used, and the successful implementation of the solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The key steps in the solution are as follows:\n\n1. **Initialization**: An array `l` is created to keep track of the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each index. It is initialized to 1 because each book can be a subsequence of length 1 by itself.\n\n2. **Early Exit**: If the array is already sorted, the solution immediately returns 0, indicating no moves are needed.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The solution iterates through each book and compares it with all previous books. If the current book is greater than or equal to a previous book, it updates the length of the longest subsequence that can be formed by including the current book.\n\n4. **Final Calculation**: The minimum number of moves required to sort the shelf is calculated as the total number of books minus the length of the longest increasing subsequence found.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The official solution effectively uses a nested loop to compute the LIS, which has a time complexity of O(N^2). This is acceptable for smaller values of N but may not be efficient for larger inputs (up to 200,000).\n- My initial approach was similar in concept but did not handle the edge cases as effectively, particularly the case where the array is already sorted.\n- The official solution's use of a direct comparison to check if the array is sorted before proceeding with the LIS calculation is a good optimization.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile my approach was on the right track, the official solution's handling of edge cases and its straightforward implementation of the LIS algorithm provided a clearer and more efficient path to the solution. In future problems, I should consider checking for sorted conditions early to avoid unnecessary computations."

It can be applied in various fields such as computer science for algorithm optimization, logistics for arranging items efficiently, and even in everyday tasks like organizing books or files.
