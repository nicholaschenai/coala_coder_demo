Anushka wants to buy chocolates.there are many chocolates in front of her, tagged with their prices.

Anushka has only a certain amount to spend, and she wants to maximize the number of chocolates she buys with this money.

Given a list of prices and an amount to spend, what is the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy? 

For example, 

if prices =[1,2,3,4]
and Anushka has k=7 to spend, she can buy items [1,2,3] for 6 , or [3,4] for 7 units of currency. she would choose the first group of 3 items.

Input Format

The first line contains two integers, n and k , the number of priced chocolates and the amount Anushka has to spend.

The next line contains n space-separated integers prices[i]

Constraints

1<= n <= 105

1<= k <= 109

1<= prices[i] <= 109



A chocolate can't be bought multiple times.

Output Format

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

INFO - [Task id] 1401 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Anushka wants to buy as many chocolates as possible without exceeding her budget. Each chocolate has a specific price, and we need to determine the maximum number of chocolates she can buy given a list of prices and a total amount of money she can spend.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - First, sort the list of chocolate prices in ascending order. This way, we can start buying the cheapest chocolates first, which will allow Anushka to maximize the number of chocolates she can buy.
   - Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of chocolates bought and a variable to keep track of the total money spent.
   - Iterate through the sorted list of prices, and for each price, check if adding that price to the total spent would exceed the budget. If it does not exceed the budget, add the price to the total spent and increment the counter. If it does exceed the budget, stop the process as we cannot afford any more chocolates.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_chocolates(n, k, prices):
       sort prices in ascending order
       initialize count = 0
       initialize total_spent = 0
       
       for price in prices:
           if total_spent + price <= k:
               total_spent += price
               count += 1
           else:
               break
       
       return count
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def max_chocolates(n, k, prices):
    # Step 1: Sort the prices in ascending order
    prices.sort()
    
    # Step 2: Initialize count of chocolates and total money spent
    count = 0
    total_spent = 0
    
    # Step 3: Iterate through the sorted prices
    for price in prices:
        # Step 4: Check if we can afford the current chocolate
        if total_spent + price <= k:
            total_spent += price  # Add the price to total spent
            count += 1            # Increment the count of chocolates bought
        else:
            break  # Stop if we can't afford the next chocolate
    
    # Step 5: Return the total count of chocolates bought
    return count

# Reading input
n, k = map(int, input().split())
prices = list(map(int, input().split()))

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host given the number of problems created by his setters, the number of problems required for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the number of days available to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for summation and list handling.

    The final implementation successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code was structured to first read input values, process each test case, and then output the results. Key strategies included using integer division to determine the number of contests and the `min` function to ensure the result did not exceed the available days. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of clear problem breakdown and efficient use of built-in functions in Python. 

    Hereâs the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]
            A = case[3]
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))

    max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases)
    ```
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute exactly \( K \) amount of money to \( N \) minions based on their individual demands. The key points to consider were whether the total demand from the minions matched \( K \), was less than \( K \), or exceeded \( K \).

    Initially, the approach focused on checking if the total demand equaled \( K \) and incorrectly assumed that if the total demand was less than \( K \), Gru could always distribute the remaining money. This led to incorrect outputs, particularly in cases where the remaining money could not be distributed without exceeding individual demands.

    The correct logic should have been:
    1. If the total demand equals \( K \), print "YES".
    2. If the total demand is less than \( K \), print "YES" since Gru can distribute the remaining money.
    3. If the total demand exceeds \( K \), print "NO".

    Despite multiple attempts to refine the logic, the solution consistently failed to account for the distribution constraints properly. The final code snippet aimed to address these issues but still produced incorrect results, indicating a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.

    ### Key Takeaways:
    - Ensure to fully understand the constraints of distribution when dealing with remaining amounts.
    - Always validate the logic against edge cases to ensure correctness.
    - The problem highlighted the importance of careful condition checking in scenarios involving sums and distributions. 

    ### Final Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            K = case[1]
            demands = case[2]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
        
            if total_demand == K:
                print("YES")
            elif total_demand < K:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        demands = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, K, demands))

   Anushka wants to buy as many chocolates as possible with a limited amount of money. Each chocolate has a specific price, and she needs to figure out how many chocolates she can buy without exceeding her budget.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - First, we will sort the list of chocolate prices in ascending order. This way, we can start buying the cheapest chocolates first, maximizing the number of chocolates Anushka can buy.
   - Then, we will iterate through the sorted list of prices, keeping track of the total amount spent and the number of chocolates bought. We will stop when adding another chocolate would exceed her budget.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function max_chocolates(n, k, prices):
       sort prices in ascending order
       total_spent = 0
       chocolates_bought = 0
       
       for price in prices:
           if total_spent + price <= k:
               total_spent += price
               chocolates_bought += 1
           else:
               break
       
       return chocolates_bought

   read n and k
   read prices
   result = max_chocolates(n, k, prices)

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1401 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy given a list of prices and a budget. The core concept involved sorting the prices to prioritize cheaper chocolates, allowing for the purchase of the maximum quantity without exceeding the budget.

The solution involved the following steps:
1. Sort the list of chocolate prices in ascending order.
2. Iterate through the sorted prices, maintaining a running total of the amount spent and the count of chocolates bought.
3. Stop the iteration when adding another chocolate would exceed the budget.

The implemented code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was straightforward, leading to a correct solution. The final code snippet is as follows:

```python
def max_chocolates(n, k, prices):
    prices.sort()
    total_spent = 0
    chocolates_bought = 0
    
    for price in prices:
        if total_spent + price <= k:
            total_spent += price
            chocolates_bought += 1
        else:
            break
    
    return chocolates_bought

n, k = map(int, input().split())
prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
result = max_chocolates(n, k, prices)
print(result)
```

This experience reinforced the importance of sorting in optimization problems and the effectiveness of a greedy approach in maximizing the number of items purchased within a budget. No unexpected errors were encountered, and the solution passed all tests successfully.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
n,k = map(int,input().split())
prices = list(map(int,input().split()))
prices.sort()
sum,cnt = 0, 0
for price in prices:
 sum += price
 if sum <= k: cnt += 1
 else: break
print(cnt)

INFO - [Task id] 1401 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem by following a straightforward approach that closely resembles my own. Both solutions involve sorting the prices of chocolates and iterating through them to maximize the number of chocolates bought without exceeding the budget. 

Key insights from the official solution include:
- The use of a single loop to accumulate the total spent and count the chocolates bought, which simplifies the logic. The official solution combines the summation and the condition check into a single loop, making it concise.
- The condition to check if the total spent exceeds the budget is placed after the summation, which allows for a more streamlined flow of logic. This ensures that the count is only incremented if the budget is not exceeded after adding the current price.

Overall, the official solution is efficient and clear, maintaining a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, followed by a linear O(n) iteration. My approach was similar in structure, but the official solution's compactness and clarity make it slightly more effective. 

In future implementations, I will aim to keep the logic as concise as possible while ensuring clarity, as demonstrated in the official solution.

The main function is `max_chocolates`.
INFO - [Task id] 1401 [generation text] This function calculates the maximum number of chocolates that can be bought within a given budget by first sorting the prices of the chocolates in ascending order. It then iterates through the sorted prices, adding the price of each chocolate to a total spent amount as long as the budget is not exceeded. If adding the next chocolate's price would exceed the budget, the iteration stops. The function keeps track of the total number of chocolates purchased and returns this count. The input consists of the number of chocolates, the budget, and a list of prices. The output is the maximum number of chocolates that can be bought without exceeding the budget.
