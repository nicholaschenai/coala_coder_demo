If it does exceed the budget, stop the process as we cannot afford any more chocolates.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function max_chocolates(n, k, prices):\n       sort prices in ascending order\n       initialize count = 0\n       initialize total_spent = 0\n       \n       for price in prices:\n           if total_spent + price <= k:\n               total_spent += price\n               count += 1\n           else:\n               break\n       \n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef max_chocolates(n, k, prices):\n    # Step 1: Sort the prices in ascending order\n    prices.sort()\n    \n    # Step 2: Initialize count of chocolates and total money spent\n    count = 0\n    total_spent = 0\n    \n    # Step 3: Iterate through the sorted prices\n    for price in prices:\n        # Step 4: Check if we can afford the current chocolate\n        if total_spent + price <= k:\n            total_spent += price  # Add the price to total spent\n            count += 1            # Increment the count of chocolates bought\n        else:\n            break  # Stop if we can't afford the next chocolate\n    \n    # Step 5: Return the total count of chocolates bought\n    return count\n\n# Reading input\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nprices = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Output the result\nprint(max_chocolates(n, k, prices))\n```"

The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the number of days available to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for summation and list handling.\n\n    The final implementation successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code was structured to first read input values, process each test case, and then output the results. Key strategies included using integer division to determine the number of contests and the `min` function to ensure the result did not exceed the available days. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of clear problem breakdown and efficient use of built-in functions in Python. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n            A = case[3]\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))\n\n    max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute exactly \\( K \\) amount of money to \\( N \\) minions based on their individual demands. The key points to consider were whether the total demand from the minions matched \\( K \\), was less than \\( K \\), or exceeded \\( K \\).\n\n    Initially, the approach focused on checking if the total demand equaled \\( K \\) and incorrectly assumed that if the total demand was less than \\( K \\), Gru could always distribute the remaining money. This led to incorrect outputs, particularly in cases where the remaining money could not be distributed without exceeding individual demands.\n\n    The correct logic should have been:\n    1. If the total demand equals \\( K \\), print \"YES\".\n    2. If the total demand is less than \\( K \\), print \"YES\" since Gru can distribute the remaining money.\n    3. If the total demand exceeds \\( K \\), print \"NO\".\n\n    Despite multiple attempts to refine the logic, the solution consistently failed to account for the distribution constraints properly. The final code snippet aimed to address these issues but still produced incorrect results, indicating a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.\n\n    ### Key Takeaways:\n    - Ensure to fully understand the constraints of distribution when dealing with remaining amounts.\n    - Always validate the logic against edge cases to ensure correctness.\n    - The problem highlighted the importance of careful condition checking in scenarios involving sums and distributions. \n\n    ### Final Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            K = case[1]\n            demands = case[2]\n            total_demand = sum(demands)\n        \n            if total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            elif total_demand < K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        demands = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, demands))\n\n    can_distribute_money(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the core concepts, strategies attempted, and the errors encountered during the problem-solving process.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

If adding the next chocolate's price would exceed the budget, the iteration stops. The function keeps track of the total number of chocolates purchased and returns this count.

For example, it can be applied in retail settings where customers want to maximize the quantity of items they can buy without exceeding their financial limits. Additionally, this approach can be beneficial in event planning, where organizers need to allocate a fixed budget for catering or gifts, ensuring they get the most value for their money.
