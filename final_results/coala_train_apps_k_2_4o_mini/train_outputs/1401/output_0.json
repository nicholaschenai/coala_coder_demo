    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   Anushka wants to buy as many chocolates as possible with a limited amount of money. Each chocolate has a specific price, and she needs to figure out how many chocolates she can buy without exceeding her budget.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - First, we will sort the list of chocolate prices in ascending order. This way, we can start buying the cheapest chocolates first, maximizing the number of chocolates Anushka can buy.\n   - Then, we will iterate through the sorted list of prices, keeping track of the total amount spent and the number of chocolates bought. We will stop when adding another chocolate would exceed her budget.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function max_chocolates(n, k, prices):\n       sort prices in ascending order\n       total_spent = 0\n       chocolates_bought = 0\n       \n       for price in prices:\n           if total_spent + price <= k:\n               total_spent += price\n               chocolates_bought += 1\n           else:\n               break\n       \n       return chocolates_bought\n\n   read n and k\n   read prices\n   result = max_chocolates(n, k, prices)\n   print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef max_chocolates(n, k, prices):\n    # Sort the prices in ascending order\n    prices.sort()\n    total_spent = 0\n    chocolates_bought = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the sorted prices\n    for price in prices:\n        # Check if we can buy this chocolate without exceeding the budget\n        if total_spent + price <= k:\n            total_spent += price  # Update the total spent\n            chocolates_bought += 1  # Increment the count of chocolates bought\n        else:\n            break  # Stop if we can't afford the next chocolate\n    \n    return chocolates_bought  # Return the total number of chocolates bought\n\n# Read input values\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nprices = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nresult = max_chocolates(n, k, prices)\nprint(result)\n```",
