    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to find the smallest possible string (in terms of lexicographical order) that can be created by removing one character from a given string and reinserting it at any position. This needs to be done for multiple test cases.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each character in the string, temporarily remove it, and then try inserting it back at every possible position in the remaining string. For each configuration, we will check if it results in a smaller string than what we have found so far. Finally, we will return the smallest string found after checking all possibilities.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S):\n       smallest_string = S  # Start with the original string as the smallest\n       for i from 0 to length of S - 1:\n           char_to_move = S[i]  # Character to remove\n           remaining_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]  # String without the character\n           for j from 0 to length of remaining_string:\n               new_string = remaining_string[:j] + char_to_move + remaining_string[j:]  # Insert character\n               if new_string < smallest_string:\n                   smallest_string = new_string  # Update smallest string\n       return smallest_string\n\n   function main():\n       read T (number of test cases)\n       for each test case:\n           read N (length of string)\n           read string S\n           result = find_lexicographically_smallest_string(S)\n           print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:\n        # Create a dictionary to count characters in t\n        char_count = {}\n        for char in t:\n            char_count[char] = char_count.get(char, 0) + 1\n        \n        # Initialize variables\n        required = len(char_count)  # Number of unique characters in t\n        l, r = 0, 0  # Left and right pointers\n        formed = 0  # To keep track of how many unique characters in t are present in the current window\n        window_counts = {}  # Dictionary to keep track of characters in the current window\n        min_length = float(\"inf\")  # To track the minimum length of the window\n        min_window = \"\"  # To store the minimum window substring\n        \n        while r < len(s):  # Expand the right pointer\n            char = s[r]\n            window_counts[char] = window_counts.get(char, 0) + 1\n            \n            # Check if the current character's count matches the required count\n            if char in char_count and window_counts[char] == char_count[char]:\n                formed += 1\n            \n            # Contract the left pointer until the window is no longer valid\n            while l <= r and formed == required:\n                char = s[l]\n                \n                # Update the minimum window if a smaller one is found\n                if r - l + 1 < min_length:\n                    min_length = r - l + 1\n                    min_window = s[l:r + 1]\n                \n                # Remove the leftmost character from the window\n                window_counts[char] -= 1\n                if char in char_count and window_counts[char] < char_count[char]:\n                    formed -= 1\n                \n                l += 1  # Move the left pointer to the right\n            \n            r += 1  # Move the right pointer to the right\n        \n        return min_window  # Return the minimum window substring\n```",
