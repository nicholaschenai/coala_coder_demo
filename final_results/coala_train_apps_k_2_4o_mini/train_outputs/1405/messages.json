There are N imposters, and each imposter can increase the level of certain sabotages based on a condition involving the greatest common divisor (gcd). Specifically, the i-th imposter can increase the level of the x-th sabotage if the gcd of i and x equals i. We need to determine how many sabotages reach level 5 after all imposters have acted.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   Each sabotage can be upgraded by imposters whose indices are divisors of the sabotage's index. For a sabotage to reach level 5, it must be upgraded by 5 different imposters. This means that the index of the sabotage must have at least 5 distinct divisors.

The series is based on the sum of squares of the first (N-1) integers, which I failed to recognize at first.\n\n    The correct approach involves calculating the sum of squares up to (N-1). The formula for the N'th term can be derived as follows: T(N) = sum(i^2) for i from 0 to N-1. This realization led to the correct implementation of the function.\n\n    The final working code correctly computes the N'th term using a loop to sum the squares:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_series(N):\n        sum_of_squares = 0\n        for i in range(N):\n            sum_of_squares += i * i\n        return sum_of_squares\n\n    T = int(input())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        result = calculate_series(N)\n        print(result)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing the series and recognizing patterns, as well as the need to validate the derived formulas against sample outputs.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The key insights from the official solution are as follows:\n\n1. **Understanding Divisor Count**: A number has exactly 5 divisors if it can be expressed as \\( p^4 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number. This is because the number of divisors function \\( d(n) \\) for \\( n = p^k \\) is \\( k + 1 \\). Therefore, for \\( p^4 \\), the number of divisors is \\( 4 + 1 = 5 \\).\n\n2. **Prime Sieve**: The solution uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to efficiently generate a list of prime numbers up to a certain limit (in this case, 32,000). This is a well-known algorithm for finding all primes less than a given number and is efficient in terms of time complexity.\n\n3. **Precomputation**: The solution precomputes the fourth powers of all primes found using the sieve. This allows for quick lookups later on.\n\n4. **Binary Search**: For each test case, the solution uses binary search (via the `bisect` module) to count how many of these precomputed fourth powers are less than or equal to N. This is efficient and allows the solution to handle large values of N (up to \\( 10^{18} \\)) without iterating through all numbers.\n\n5. **Efficiency**: The overall complexity is significantly reduced compared to the initial approach, which would have required checking each number up to N for its divisor count. Instead, the official solution leverages mathematical properties and efficient algorithms to achieve the result in a much more scalable manner.\n\nIn summary, the official solution is insightful because it reduces the problem to a mathematical property of numbers and uses efficient algorithms (sieve and binary search) to handle potentially large inputs effectively. This approach is much more optimal than iterating through all numbers and counting divisors directly."

For each subsequent line, it retrieves a number and counts how many integers from 1 to that number have exactly five divisors. The results for each test case are collected in a list. Finally, it prints the results, each on a new line. The function effectively processes input and outputs the desired counts for each test case.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to analyze the distribution of divisors among integers, particularly in competitive programming or algorithm design. It can help in understanding how to efficiently count specific properties of numbers, such as the number of integers with a certain number of divisors, which can be relevant in number theory, cryptography, and optimization problems. Additionally, it can be applied in games or simulations where resource allocation or leveling systems are based on mathematical properties of numbers."
