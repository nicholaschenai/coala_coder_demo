    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We have a game scenario where there are N sabotages, all starting at level 0. N imposters can upgrade these sabotages based on a specific condition involving the greatest common divisor (gcd). The task is to determine how many sabotages reach level 5 after all imposters have completed their upgrades.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   Each imposter i can upgrade sabotage x if the gcd of i and x equals i. This means that x must be a multiple of i. For each imposter, we need to count how many sabotages can be upgraded by them. The goal is to find out how many sabotages reach exactly level 5 after all imposters have acted. \n\n   To achieve this, we can observe that:\n   - A sabotage x will be upgraded by all imposters that are divisors of x.\n   - The level of sabotage x will be equal to the number of its divisors.\n   - We need to count how many numbers from 1 to N have exactly 5 divisors.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_sabotages_with_level_5(N):\n       count = 0\n       for x from 1 to N:\n           if number_of_divisors(x) == 5:\n               count += 1\n       return count\n\n   function number_of_divisors(x):\n       count = 0\n       for i from 1 to sqrt(x):\n           if x % i == 0:\n               count += 1\n               if i != x / i:\n                   count += 1\n       return count\n\n   function main():\n       read T\n       for each test case:\n           read N\n           result = count_sabotages_with_level_5(N)\n           print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef number_of_divisors(x):\n    # This function counts the number of divisors of x\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, int(x**0.5) + 1):\n        if x % i == 0:\n            count += 1  # i is a divisor\n            if i != x // i:\n                count += 1  # x // i is also a divisor\n    return count\n\ndef count_sabotages_with_level_5(N):\n    # This function counts how many numbers from 1 to N have exactly 5 divisors\n    count = 0\n    for x in range(1, N + 1):\n        if number_of_divisors(x) == 5:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])  # Number of test cases\n    results = []\n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        N = int(data[i])\n        result = count_sabotages_with_level_5(N)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    print(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)))\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n```",
