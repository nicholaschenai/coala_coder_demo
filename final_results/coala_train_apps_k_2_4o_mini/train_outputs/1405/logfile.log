## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
There are $N$ sabotages available in the game Among Us, initially all at level $0$. 
$N$ imposters are allotted the task to upgrade the level of the sabotages. 
The $i^{th}$ imposter $(1 \leq i \leq N)$ increases the level of $x^{th}$ sabotage $(1 \leq x \leq N)$ by one level  if $gcd(i,x)=i$.
You need to find the number of sabotages at LEVEL 5 after all the imposters have completed their tasks.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer $N$. 

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line the number of sabotages at LEVEL 5.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^{18}$

-----Sample Input:-----
1
6

-----Sample Output:-----
0

-----EXPLANATION:-----
The $1^{st}$ sabotage is at level $1$, the $2^{nd}$, $3^{rd}$ and $5^{th}$ sabotages are at level $2$, the $4^{th}$ sabotage is at level $3$ and the $6^{th}$ sabotage is at level $4$.
None of them reach level $5$. Hence the output is $0$.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1405 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a game with N sabotages, all starting at level 0. There are N imposters, and each imposter can increase the level of certain sabotages based on a condition involving the greatest common divisor (gcd). Specifically, the i-th imposter can increase the level of the x-th sabotage if the gcd of i and x equals i. We need to determine how many sabotages reach level 5 after all imposters have acted.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   Each sabotage can be upgraded by imposters whose indices are divisors of the sabotage's index. For a sabotage to reach level 5, it must be upgraded by 5 different imposters. This means that the index of the sabotage must have at least 5 distinct divisors. The number of distinct divisors of a number can be determined by its prime factorization. We need to find out how many numbers from 1 to N have at least 5 distinct divisors.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - For each test case:
     - Initialize a counter for sabotages at level 5.
     - Loop through numbers from 1 to N:
       - For each number, calculate the number of distinct divisors.
       - If the number of distinct divisors is 5 or more, increment the counter.
     - Output the counter.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def count_sabotages_at_level_5(N):
    # Function to count the number of distinct divisors of a number
    def count_divisors(n):
        count = 0

            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1  # i is a divisor
                if i != n // i:
                    count += 1  # n // i is also a divisor
        return count

    # Initialize the count of sabotages at level 5

        - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
        - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
        - Next Q line contains two number I and K.

        {1,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
           We need to find the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} such that a specific number I appears at the K-th position in the sorted order of the subset. We will handle multiple queries for each test case, and the results should be printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
           To solve this problem, we need to understand how to count the valid subsets:
           - For a number I to be at the K-th position in a subset, there must be exactly K-1 numbers that are less than I in the subset.
           - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than I.
           - We can use combinatorial counting to determine how many ways we can choose K-1 numbers from the numbers less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I.
           - The total number of valid subsets can be calculated using combinations and powers of 2.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th term in a specific series defined as 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, etc. Initially, I misidentified the formula for generating the series, leading to incorrect outputs. The series is based on the sum of squares of the first (N-1) integers, which I failed to recognize at first.

    The correct approach involves calculating the sum of squares up to (N-1). The formula for the N'th term can be derived as follows: T(N) = sum(i^2) for i from 0 to N-1. This realization led to the correct implementation of the function.

    The final working code correctly computes the N'th term using a loop to sum the squares:

    ```python
    def calculate_series(N):
        sum_of_squares = 0
        for i in range(N):
            sum_of_squares += i * i
        return sum_of_squares

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        result = calculate_series(N)
        print(result)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing the series and recognizing patterns, as well as the need to validate the derived formulas against sample outputs.

INFO - [Task id] 1405 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a game scenario where there are N sabotages, all starting at level 0. N imposters can upgrade these sabotages based on a specific condition involving the greatest common divisor (gcd). The task is to determine how many sabotages reach level 5 after all imposters have completed their upgrades.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   Each imposter i can upgrade sabotage x if the gcd of i and x equals i. This means that x must be a multiple of i. For each imposter, we need to count how many sabotages can be upgraded by them. The goal is to find out how many sabotages reach exactly level 5 after all imposters have acted. 

   To achieve this, we can observe that:
   - A sabotage x will be upgraded by all imposters that are divisors of x.
   - The level of sabotage x will be equal to the number of its divisors.
   - We need to count how many numbers from 1 to N have exactly 5 divisors.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_sabotages_with_level_5(N):
       count = 0
       for x from 1 to N:
           if number_of_divisors(x) == 5:
               count += 1
       return count

   function number_of_divisors(x):
       count = 0

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a game scenario where there are N sabotages, all starting at level 0. N imposters can upgrade these sabotages based on a specific condition involving the greatest common divisor (gcd). The task is to determine how many sabotages reach level 5 after all imposters have completed their upgrades.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   Each imposter i can upgrade sabotage x if the gcd of i and x equals i. This means that x must be a multiple of i. For each imposter, we need to count how many sabotages can be upgraded by them. The goal is to find out how many sabotages reach exactly level 5 after all imposters have acted. 

   To achieve this, we can observe that:

INFO - [Task id] 1405 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine how many sabotages reach exactly level 5 after N imposters have upgraded them based on the condition involving the greatest common divisor (gcd). The key insight was that the level of a sabotage corresponds to the number of its divisors, and we needed to count how many numbers from 1 to N have exactly 5 divisors.

The initial approach involved iterating through each number up to N and counting its divisors, which is inefficient for large values of N (up to \(10^{18}\)). This method would not scale well due to the time complexity of counting divisors for each number.

A more efficient strategy would involve recognizing that numbers with exactly 5 divisors must be of the form \(p^4\) where \(p\) is a prime number. This means we only need to find prime numbers \(p\) such that \(p^4 \leq N\). This significantly reduces the number of checks needed.

The final code implementation was structured to read multiple test cases and output the results efficiently. The initial implementation was correct for small inputs but would fail for larger values due to performance issues. 

Key takeaway: For problems involving counting divisors, identifying mathematical properties (like the form of numbers with a specific number of divisors) can lead to more efficient solutions.

INFO - [Task id] 1405 [generation text] The official solution employs a more efficient approach to determine how many numbers from 1 to N have exactly 5 divisors. The key insights from the official solution are as follows:

1. **Understanding Divisor Count**: A number has exactly 5 divisors if it can be expressed as \( p^4 \), where \( p \) is a prime number. This is because the number of divisors function \( d(n) \) for \( n = p^k \) is \( k + 1 \). Therefore, for \( p^4 \), the number of divisors is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \).

2. **Prime Sieve**: The solution uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to efficiently generate a list of prime numbers up to a certain limit (in this case, 32,000). This is a well-known algorithm for finding all primes less than a given number and is efficient in terms of time complexity.

3. **Precomputation**: The solution precomputes the fourth powers of all primes found using the sieve. This allows for quick lookups later on.

4. **Binary Search**: For each test case, the solution uses binary search (via the `bisect` module) to count how many of these precomputed fourth powers are less than or equal to N. This is efficient and allows the solution to handle large values of N (up to \( 10^{18} \)) without iterating through all numbers.

5. **Efficiency**: The overall complexity is significantly reduced compared to the initial approach, which would have required checking each number up to N for its divisor count. Instead, the official solution leverages mathematical properties and efficient algorithms to achieve the result in a much more scalable manner.

In summary, the official solution is insightful because it reduces the problem to a mathematical property of numbers and uses efficient algorithms (sieve and binary search) to handle potentially large inputs effectively. This approach is much more optimal than iterating through all numbers and counting divisors directly.

[Problem]
    There are $N$ sabotages available in the game Among Us, initially all at level $0$. 
    $N$ imposters are allotted the task to upgrade the level of the sabotages. 
    The $i^{th}$ imposter $(1 \leq i \leq N)$ increases the level of $x^{th}$ sabotage $(1 \leq x \leq N)$ by one level  if $gcd(i,x)=i$.
    You need to find the number of sabotages at LEVEL 5 after all the imposters have completed their tasks.

    -----Input:-----
    - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
    - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer $N$. 

    -----Output:-----
    For each testcase, output in a single line the number of sabotages at LEVEL 5.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
    - $1 \leq N \leq 10^{18}$

    -----Sample Input:-----
    1
    6

    -----Sample Output:-----
    0

    -----EXPLANATION:-----
    The $1^{st}$ sabotage is at level $1$, the $2^{nd}$, $3^{rd}$ and $5^{th}$ sabotages are at level $2$, the $4^{th}$ sabotage is at level $3$ and the $6^{th}$ sabotage is at level $4$.
    None of them reach level $5$. Hence the output is $0$.
