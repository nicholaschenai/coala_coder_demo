    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The problem involves planning train travel on specific days of the year, where you can buy different types of train tickets (1-day, 7-day, and 30-day passes) at varying costs. The goal is to determine the minimum amount of money needed to cover all the travel days specified in a list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will create an array where each index represents the minimum cost to travel up to that day. For each travel day, we will consider the cost of each type of ticket and update our cost array accordingly. We will check the costs for the 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day passes, and choose the minimum cost option for each day.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Initialize a cost array of size 366 (to cover days 1 to 365) with all values set to infinity, except for cost[0] = 0 (no cost before any travel).\n   For each day in the travel days:\n       For each type of ticket (1-day, 7-day, 30-day):\n           Calculate the cost if the ticket is purchased on that day.\n           Update the cost array for the days covered by that ticket.\n   Return the minimum cost to cover all travel days.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def mincostTickets(self, days: list[int], costs: list[int]) -> int:\n        # Initialize a cost array with size 366 (to cover days 1 to 365)\n        cost = [float('inf')] * 366\n        cost[0] = 0  # No cost before any travel\n        \n        # Iterate through each travel day\n        for day in days:\n            # Calculate the minimum cost for each type of ticket\n            cost[day] = min(cost[day], cost[day - 1] + costs[0])  # 1-day pass\n            cost[day] = min(cost[day], cost[max(0, day - 7)] + costs[1])  # 7-day pass\n            cost[day] = min(cost[day], cost[max(0, day - 30)] + costs[2])  # 30-day pass\n        \n        # The answer is the minimum cost to cover all travel days\n        return cost[days[-1]]\n```",
