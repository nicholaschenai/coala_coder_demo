The solution utilized a sliding window approach, which is effective for problems involving contiguous subarrays. \n\n    The core concept involved maintaining two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the current subarray. As the `right` pointer expanded to include more elements, we counted the odd numbers. If the count exceeded `k`, we moved the `left` pointer to reduce the count. When the count matched `k`, we calculated how many valid subarrays could be formed by counting the even numbers to the left of the `left` pointer.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test cases. The key strategies that worked included efficiently managing the count of odd numbers and leveraging the properties of even numbers to determine the number of valid subarrays. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed well within the constraints. \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:\n            count = 0\n            left = 0\n            odd_count = 0\n            total_nice_subarrays = 0\n        \n            for right in range(len(nums)):\n                if nums[right] % 2 == 1:\n                    odd_count += 1\n            \n                while odd_count > k:\n                    if nums[left] % 2 == 1:\n                        odd_count -= 1\n                    left += 1\n            \n                if odd_count == k:\n                    temp_left = left\n                    while temp_left < right and nums[temp_left] % 2 == 0:\n                        temp_left += 1\n                    count_left = temp_left - left + 1\n                    total_nice_subarrays += count_left\n        \n            return total_nice_subarrays\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the effectiveness of the sliding window technique for problems involving subarrays and counting specific conditions.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted array of integers. The solution utilized dynamic programming, which is a common approach for problems involving subsequences. The key concept was to maintain an array `d` where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. \n\n    The algorithm iterated through the input list, comparing each element with all previous elements to determine if they could form an increasing subsequence. If they could, the length was updated accordingly. The final result was obtained by finding the maximum value in the `d` array.\n\n    The implemented solution was efficient with a time complexity of O(n^2), which is acceptable for this problem size. The code was structured clearly, with comments explaining each step, making it easy to follow. The solution passed all tests, confirming its correctness.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n            n = len(nums)\n            if n == 0:\n                return 0\n            d = [1] * n\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                for j in range(i):\n                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n            return max(d)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of dynamic programming in solving subsequence-related problems and highlighted the effectiveness of a structured approach to coding.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:\n\n1. **Cumulative Sum**: The solution maintains a running cumulative sum (`cum_sum`) of the elements in the array. This allows for quick calculation of the sum of any subarray by subtracting two cumulative sums.\n\n2. **Deque for Indices**: A deque is used to store pairs of indices and their corresponding cumulative sums. This helps in efficiently finding the shortest subarray that meets the sum requirement.\n\n3. **Two Main Conditions**:\n   - When a positive number is encountered, the solution checks if the difference between the current cumulative sum and the cumulative sum at the front of the deque is at least K. If so, it updates the result with the length of the subarray and removes the front element from the deque.\n   - When a negative number is encountered, the solution removes elements from the back of the deque that have a cumulative sum greater than or equal to the current cumulative sum, as they cannot contribute to a shorter valid subarray.\n\n4. **Result Calculation**: After processing all elements, the solution checks if a valid subarray was found by comparing the result with the length of the array. If no valid subarray exists, it returns -1.\n\nThe official solution is efficient in both time and space complexity, leveraging the properties of cumulative sums and the deque structure to maintain a dynamic list of potential subarray starting points. This approach is more optimal than a naive method that would involve checking all possible subarrays, which would be computationally expensive. \n\nOverall, the use of cumulative sums and a deque is a powerful technique for solving problems involving subarrays and can be applied to similar problems in the future."
