INFO - [Task id] 312 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray from a given list of integers such that the sum of the elements in that subarray is at least a specified value K. If no such subarray exists, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach combined with prefix sums. We will maintain a cumulative sum of the elements as we iterate through the list. For each element, we will check if the sum of any subarray ending at that element meets or exceeds K. We can use a deque to efficiently track the indices of the prefix sums that can potentially form valid subarrays. If we find a valid subarray, we will update the minimum length found so far.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize a variable to store the prefix sum and a deque to store indices of prefix sums
   Initialize a variable to store the minimum length of the subarray found (set to infinity)
   Iterate through the array:
       Update the prefix sum with the current element
       While the deque is not empty and the prefix sum minus the prefix sum at the front of the deque is at least K:
           Calculate the length of the subarray and update the minimum length if it's shorter
           Remove the front of the deque
       Append the current index to the deque
   If the minimum length is still infinity, return -1
   Otherwise, return the minimum length
   ```

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to count the number of continuous subarrays that contain exactly `k` odd numbers from a given list of integers. The solution utilized a sliding window approach, which is effective for problems involving contiguous subarrays. 

    The core concept involved maintaining two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the current subarray. As the `right` pointer expanded to include more elements, we counted the odd numbers. If the count exceeded `k`, we moved the `left` pointer to reduce the count. When the count matched `k`, we calculated how many valid subarrays could be formed by counting the even numbers to the left of the `left` pointer.

    The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test cases. The key strategies that worked included efficiently managing the count of odd numbers and leveraging the properties of even numbers to determine the number of valid subarrays. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed well within the constraints. 

    The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
            count = 0
            left = 0
            odd_count = 0
            total_nice_subarrays = 0
        
            for right in range(len(nums)):
                if nums[right] % 2 == 1:
                    odd_count += 1
            
                while odd_count > k:
                    if nums[left] % 2 == 1:
                        odd_count -= 1
                    left += 1
            
                if odd_count == k:
                    temp_left = left
                    while temp_left < right and nums[temp_left] % 2 == 0:
                        temp_left += 1
                    count_left = temp_left - left + 1
                    total_nice_subarrays += count_left
        
            return total_nice_subarrays
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the effectiveness of the sliding window technique for problems involving subarrays and counting specific conditions.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    The problem involved finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted array of integers. The solution utilized dynamic programming, which is a common approach for problems involving subsequences. The key concept was to maintain an array `d` where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. 

    The algorithm iterated through the input list, comparing each element with all previous elements to determine if they could form an increasing subsequence. If they could, the length was updated accordingly. The final result was obtained by finding the maximum value in the `d` array.

    The implemented solution was efficient with a time complexity of O(n^2), which is acceptable for this problem size. The code was structured clearly, with comments explaining each step, making it easy to follow. The solution passed all tests, confirming its correctness.

    Hereâs the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
            n = len(nums)
            if n == 0:
                return 0
            d = [1] * n
            for i in range(1, n):
                for j in range(i):
                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
            return max(d)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of dynamic programming in solving subsequence-related problems and highlighted the effectiveness of a structured approach to coding.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach combined with prefix sums. We will maintain a running sum of the elements in the current window and expand the window by moving the right pointer.

We will keep track of the minimum length of such subarrays found during the process.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:

   Initialize a variable to store the minimum length of the subarray (set to infinity)
   Initialize a prefix sum array to store cumulative sums
   Initialize a deque to store indices of the prefix sums

Return the length of the shortest, non-empty, contiguousÂ subarray of A with sum at least K.
If there is no non-empty subarray with sum at least K, return -1.
Â 



Example 1:

INFO - [Task id] 312 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to find the shortest contiguous subarray from a given list of integers such that the sum of the elements in that subarray is at least a specified value, K. If no such subarray exists, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach combined with prefix sums. We will maintain a running sum of the elements in the current window and expand the window by moving the right pointer. If the sum of the current window meets or exceeds K, we will try to shrink the window from the left to find the shortest valid subarray. We will keep track of the minimum length of such subarrays found during the process.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Initialize a variable to store the minimum length of the subarray (set to infinity)
   Initialize a prefix sum array to store cumulative sums
   Initialize a deque to store indices of the prefix sums

   For each index in the array:
       Update the prefix sum
       While the deque is not empty and the current prefix sum minus the prefix sum at the front of the deque is at least K:
           Calculate the length of the subarray and update the minimum length
           Remove the front of the deque
       Add the current index to the deque
       Remove indices from the back of the deque while the current prefix sum is less than or equal to the prefix sum at the back of the deque

INFO - [Task id] 312 [generation text] The problem involved finding the length of the shortest contiguous subarray with a sum of at least K. The solution utilized a combination of prefix sums and a deque to efficiently track potential subarrays. The key concepts included maintaining a running sum and using a sliding window approach to dynamically adjust the size of the subarray while checking for the required sum.

The implemented strategy involved calculating prefix sums to facilitate quick sum calculations for any subarray. A deque was used to store indices of the prefix sums, allowing for efficient removal of elements that no longer contributed to valid subarrays. The algorithm successfully handled edge cases, such as when no valid subarray exists, by returning -1.

The final code was structured to ensure clarity and efficiency, and it passed all provided test cases. The approach demonstrated the effectiveness of using prefix sums and deques for problems involving subarray sums, which is a common pattern in competitive programming. 

Here is the final solution for reference:

        return result if result <= len(A) else -1    

INFO - [Task id] 312 [generation text] The official solution effectively utilizes a combination of cumulative sums and a deque to maintain potential starting points for valid subarrays. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:

1. **Cumulative Sum**: The solution maintains a running cumulative sum (`cum_sum`) of the elements in the array. This allows for quick calculation of the sum of any subarray by subtracting two cumulative sums.

2. **Deque for Indices**: A deque is used to store pairs of indices and their corresponding cumulative sums. This helps in efficiently finding the shortest subarray that meets the sum requirement.

3. **Two Main Conditions**:
   - When a positive number is encountered, the solution checks if the difference between the current cumulative sum and the cumulative sum at the front of the deque is at least K. If so, it updates the result with the length of the subarray and removes the front element from the deque.
   - When a negative number is encountered, the solution removes elements from the back of the deque that have a cumulative sum greater than or equal to the current cumulative sum, as they cannot contribute to a shorter valid subarray.

4. **Result Calculation**: After processing all elements, the solution checks if a valid subarray was found by comparing the result with the length of the array. If no valid subarray exists, it returns -1.

The official solution is efficient in both time and space complexity, leveraging the properties of cumulative sums and the deque structure to maintain a dynamic list of potential subarray starting points. This approach is more optimal than a naive method that would involve checking all possible subarrays, which would be computationally expensive. 

Overall, the use of cumulative sums and a deque is a powerful technique for solving problems involving subarrays and can be applied to similar problems in the future.
