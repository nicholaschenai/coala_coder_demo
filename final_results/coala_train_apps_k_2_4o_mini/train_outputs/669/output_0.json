    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to determine how many different paths Ryan can take through a network of cities over a specified number of seconds, while also satisfying certain conditions about which cities he must be in at specific times. Each city is connected by roads, and Ryan can either move to an adjacent city or stay in his current city at each second.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways Ryan can be in each city at each second. We will create a 2D array where the rows represent the time (from 0 to K) and the columns represent the cities (from 1 to N). We will initialize the starting position (city 1 at time 0) and then iterate through each second, updating the number of ways to reach each city based on the number of ways to reach adjacent cities in the previous second. After processing all seconds, we will check the conditions provided and count the valid paths that meet those conditions.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_trips(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):\n       MOD = 10**9 + 7\n       # Create adjacency list for the cities\n       graph = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]\n       for each road (u, v) in roads:\n           graph[u].append(v)\n           graph[v].append(u)\n\n       # Initialize DP table\n       dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]\n       dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0\n\n       # Fill the DP table\n       for t in range(K):\n           for city in range(1, N + 1):\n               if dp[t][city] > 0:\n                   # Move to adjacent cities or stay\n                   for neighbor in graph[city]:\n                       dp[t + 1][neighbor] = (dp[t + 1][neighbor] + dp[t][city]) % MOD\n                   dp[t + 1][city] = (dp[t + 1][city] + dp[t][city]) % MOD\n\n       # Count valid trips based on conditions\n       valid_trips = 1\n       for (a, b) in conditions:\n           valid_trips = (valid_trips * dp[b][a]) % MOD\n\n       return valid_trips\n\n   function main():\n       read T\n       for each test case:\n           read N, M, K\n           read roads\n           read Q\n           read conditions\n           result = count_trips(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)\n           print(result)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef count_trips(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    # Create adjacency list for the cities\n    graph = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]\n    for u, v in roads:\n        graph[u].append(v)\n        graph[v].append(u)\n\n    # Initialize DP table\n    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]\n    dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0\n\n    # Fill the DP table\n    for t in range(K):\n        for city in range(1, N + 1):\n            if dp[t][city] > 0:\n                # Move to adjacent cities or stay\n                for neighbor in graph[city]:\n                    dp[t + 1][neighbor] = (dp[t + 1][neighbor] + dp[t][city]) % MOD\n                dp[t + 1][city] = (dp[t + 1][city] + dp[t][city]) % MOD\n\n    # Count valid trips based on conditions\n    valid_trips = 1\n    for a, b in conditions:\n        valid_trips = (valid_trips * dp[b][a]) % MOD\n\n    return valid_trips\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n\n    T = int(data[0])  # Number of test cases\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, M, K = map(int, data[index].split())\n        roads = []\n        for j in range(M):\n            u, v = map(int, data[index + 1 + j].split())\n            roads.append((u, v))\n        index += 1 + M\n        Q = int(data[index])\n        conditions = []\n        for j in range(Q):\n            a, b = map(int, data[index + 1 + j].split())\n            conditions.append((a, b))\n        index += 1 + Q\n        result = count_trips(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)\n        results.append(result)\n\n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n```",
