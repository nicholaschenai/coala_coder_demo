Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 961 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem requires us to count the number of inversions in an array of natural numbers for multiple test cases. An inversion is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j]. 

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To efficiently count the number of inversions, we can use a modified merge sort algorithm. The merge sort will help us sort the array while simultaneously counting the inversions. During the merge step, when we take an element from the right half before taking an element from the left half, it indicates that there are inversions equal to the number of remaining elements in the left half.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_inversions(arr):
       if length of arr <= 1:
           return 0
       mid = length of arr // 2
       left = arr[0:mid]
       right = arr[mid:length of arr]
       
       inversions = count_inversions(left) + count_inversions(right)
       inversions += merge_and_count(arr, left, right)
       return inversions

   function merge_and_count(arr, left, right):
       i = 0, j = 0, k = 0
       inversions = 0
       while i < length of left and j < length of right:
           if left[i] <= right[j]:
               arr[k] = left[i]
               i += 1
           else:
               arr[k] = right[j]
               inversions += (length of left - i)  // Count inversions
               j += 1
           k += 1
       while i < length of left:
           arr[k] = left[i]
           i += 1
           k += 1
       while j < length of right:
           arr[k] = right[j]
           j += 1
           k += 1
       return inversions

   function main():
       read T
       for each test case:
           read N
           read array of N numbers
           result = count_inversions(array)
           print result
   ```

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
           We need to find the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} such that a specific number I appears at the K-th position in the sorted order of the subset. We will handle multiple queries for each test case, and the results should be printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
           To solve this problem, we need to understand how to count the valid subsets:
           - For a number I to be at the K-th position in a subset, there must be exactly K-1 numbers that are less than I in the subset.
           - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than I.
           - We can use combinatorial counting to determine how many ways we can choose K-1 numbers from the numbers less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I.
           - The total number of valid subsets can be calculated using combinations and powers of 2.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
           ```
           function count_subsets(N, queries):
               MOD = 10**9 + 7
               precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to N
       
               for each query (I, K):
                   if K > I or K < 1:
                       print 0
                   else:
                       count_less = I - 1

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to determine the number of exterminable subarrays from given arrays based on a specific stack operation. The core concept involved simulating the stack behavior while iterating through all possible subarrays using a two-pointer technique. The stack operation dictated that if the current element matched the top of the stack, the top element would be popped instead of pushing the current element.

    The solution involved iterating through each starting point of the subarray and extending it to each possible endpoint while maintaining a stack to track the extermination process. If the stack was empty after processing a subarray, it was counted as exterminable. This approach effectively captured all valid subarrays without missing any potential combinations.

    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input/output requirements. The code was structured to read multiple queries, process each array, and output the results efficiently. The solution passed all provided test cases, confirming its correctness and efficiency given the constraints. 

    Key takeaways include the importance of understanding stack operations and how they can be applied to problems involving subarrays, as well as the effectiveness of a two-pointer approach in exploring combinations within an array. The solution was implemented without any external libraries, adhering to the problem constraints. 

    Here is the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def count_exterminable_subarrays(array):
        total_count = 0
        n = len(array)
    
        for start in range(n):
            stack = []
            for end in range(start, n):
                current_element = array[end]
                if not stack or stack[-1] != current_element:
                    stack.append(current_element)
                else:
                    stack.pop()
                if not stack:
                    total_count += 1

INFO - [Task id] 961 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the total number of inversions in an array of natural numbers for multiple test cases. An inversion is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j]. 

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To efficiently count the number of inversions in an array, we can use a modified merge sort algorithm. The idea is to divide the array into two halves, count the inversions in each half recursively, and then count the inversions that occur between the two halves while merging them back together. This approach allows us to count inversions in O(N log N) time, which is efficient enough given the constraints.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):
       i = left    # Starting index for left subarray
       j = mid + 1 # Starting index for right subarray
       k = left    # Starting index to be sorted
       inv_count = 0

       while i <= mid and j <= right:
           if arr[i] <= arr[j]:
               temp_arr[k] = arr[i]
               i += 1
           else:
               temp_arr[k] = arr[j]
               inv_count += (mid - i + 1) # Count inversions
               j += 1
           k += 1

       while i <= mid:
           temp_arr[k] = arr[i]

           inv_count += merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right)
       return inv_count

INFO - [Task id] 961 [generation text] In this task, I was required to count the number of inversions in an array of natural numbers for multiple test cases. An inversion is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j]. The efficient approach to solve this problem is to use a modified merge sort algorithm, which allows counting inversions in O(N log N) time.

The solution involved implementing two main functions: `merge_and_count`, which merges two halves of the array while counting inversions, and `merge_sort_and_count`, which recursively divides the array and aggregates the inversion counts. The final function, `count_inversions`, initializes a temporary array and calls the merge sort function.

The implementation was successful, and the code passed the provided test case. The key takeaway is the effectiveness of the merge sort technique for counting inversions, which is crucial for handling larger arrays efficiently. The solution is structured to read input directly from standard input, making it suitable for competitive programming contexts. 

Hereâ€™s the core code snippet for reference:

```python
def merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):
    # Merging and counting inversions
    ...

def merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):
    # Recursive merge sort and count
    ...

def count_inversions(arr):
    # Initialize temporary array and count inversions
    ...

def main():
    # Read input and process each test case
    ...
``` 

This experience reinforced the importance of understanding algorithmic efficiency and the utility of divide-and-conquer strategies in solving complex problems.

INFO - [Task id] 961 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the total number of inversions in an array of natural numbers for multiple test cases. An inversion is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j]. 

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To efficiently count the number of inversions in an array, we can use a modified merge sort algorithm. The idea is to divide the array into two halves, count the inversions in each half recursively, and then count the inversions that occur between the two halves while merging them back together. This approach allows us to count inversions in O(N log N) time, which is efficient enough given the constraints.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):
       i = left    # Starting index for left subarray
       j = mid + 1 # Starting index for right subarray

       inv_count = 0

INFO - [Task id] 961 [generation text] The official solution effectively implements a modified merge sort algorithm to count inversions in an array. The key insights from this solution include:

1. **Recursive Division**: The array is recursively divided into two halves until each subarray contains a single element. This is a standard approach in divide-and-conquer algorithms.

2. **Counting Inversions During Merge**: While merging the two sorted halves, the algorithm counts inversions. An inversion is counted when an element from the right half is smaller than an element from the left half, indicating that all remaining elements in the left half (which are greater) form inversions with this element.

3. **Efficiency**: The overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(N log N), which is efficient for the input size constraints (up to 100,000 elements). This is significantly better than a naive O(N^2) approach that would involve checking each pair of elements.

4. **Use of Temporary Array**: A temporary array is used to facilitate the merging process, ensuring that the original array is updated only after all elements are processed.

5. **Clear Structure**: The separation of the merge function and the recursive sort function enhances readability and maintainability of the code.

In my own attempt, I followed a similar structure but could have improved clarity by ensuring that the merge function was more explicitly defined and separated from the counting logic. The official solution's clear distinction between the merge and sort functions helps in understanding the flow of the algorithm better. 

Overall, the official solution serves as a solid reference for implementing inversion counting using merge sort, highlighting the importance of efficient algorithms in handling large datasets.

[Problem]
    The chef has one array of N natural numbers (might be in sorted order). Cheffina challenges chef to find the total number of inversions in the array.

    -----Input:-----
    - First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
    - Each test case contains two lines of input, $N$.
    - N space-separated natural numbers. 

    -----Output:-----
    For each test case, output in a single line answer as the total number of inversions.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 10$
    - $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
    - $1 \leq arr[i] \leq 10^5$

    -----Sample Input:-----
    1
    5
    5 4 1 3 2

    -----Sample Output:-----
    8
