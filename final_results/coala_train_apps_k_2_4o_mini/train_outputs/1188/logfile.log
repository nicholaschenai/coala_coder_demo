## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains one integer N.
Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

-----Output-----
Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order â€” the indices of potential killers.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ Ri â‰¤ N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.
- It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef is investigating a murder case involving a mafia organization. Each member of the mafia reports to another member, and there is a single Don who reports to no one (indicated by a reporting value of 0). The task is to identify the members of the mafia who are not reported to by anyone else, as these members are considered potential killers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the potential killers, we need to determine which members of the mafia do not appear as a reporting target for any other member. We can achieve this by:
   - Creating a list to track how many members report to each member.
   - Iterating through the reporting list to populate this tracking list.
   - Finally, we will collect the indices of members who have a count of zero in the tracking list, as these members are not reported to by anyone.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize a list 'report_count' of size N+1 with all zeros
   For each member i from 1 to N:
       If Ri is not 0:
           Increment report_count[Ri] by 1
   Initialize an empty list 'potential_killers'
   For each member i from 1 to N:
       If report_count[i] is 0:
           Append i to potential_killers
   Sort potential_killers
   Print the elements of potential_killers as space-separated integers
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def find_potential_killers():
    # Read the number of members
    N = int(input())
    # Read the reporting structure
    R = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize a list to count how many people report to each member
    report_count = [0] * (N + 1)
    
    # Count the number of reports for each member
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        Ri = R[i - 1]  # R is 0-indexed, members are 1-indexed
        if Ri != 0:
            report_count[Ri] += 1
    
    # Find all members who are not reported to by anyone
    potential_killers = []
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if report_count[i] == 0:
            potential_killers.append(i)
    
    # Sort the potential killers
    potential_killers.sort()
    
    # Print the result as space-separated integers
    print(" ".join(map(str, potential_killers)))

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine how many walls he needs to break to reach Dr. Doof, based on given wall positions and Chef's starting coordinates. The problem involved checking if Chef's position was on any wall and counting how many walls were above his maximum coordinate.

    The core concept involved understanding the geometric representation of walls as line segments and how to efficiently determine the number of walls Chef would need to break through. The solution utilized a straightforward approach of iterating through wall positions and comparing them to Chef's coordinates.

    The implemented solution successfully handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that if Chef's position was on a wall, it returned -1. Otherwise, it counted the walls that were above the maximum of Chef's x and y coordinates. The code was structured to read multiple test cases and queries efficiently.

    Key takeaways include the importance of checking conditions before performing calculations and the efficiency of using simple comparisons to solve geometric problems. The solution was effective, and no unexpected errors occurred during implementation. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def process_test_cases(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            walls = list(map(int, input().split()))
            Q = int(input())
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                x_j, y_j = map(int, input().split())
            
                if x_j == y_j and x_j in walls:
                    print(-1)
                    continue
            
                count = 0
                max_coord = max(x_j, y_j)
            
                for wall in walls:
                    if wall > max_coord:
                        count += 1
            
                print(count)

    T = int(input())
    process_test_cases(T)
    ``` 

    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process and the final solution, which can be referenced for similar geometric problems in the future.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
        Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

        -----Input-----
        - First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
        - The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
        - The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
        - The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
        - The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

        -----Output-----
        For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
        - $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
        - $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
        - $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
        - $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
        - Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

        -----Sample Input-----
        1
        2
        1 3
        5
        0 0
        2 0
        0 4
        1 1
        1 2

        -----Sample Output-----
        0
        1
        2
        1
        -1

        -----Explanation-----
        The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

        If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

        If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

        If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
           The problem involves helping Chef determine how many walls he needs to break through to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). Each wall is represented by a line segment connecting points on the x-axis and y-axis. For each starting position of Chef, we need to check if he is on a wall, and if not, count how many walls he would need to break to reach the origin.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
           - For each test case, read the number of walls and their respective positions.
           - For each query (Chef's starting position), check if the position lies on any wall. If it does, return -1.
           - If not, determine how many walls Chef would need to break through to reach the origin. This can be done by checking how many wall positions are greater than the maximum of Chef's x and y coordinates.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
           ```
           function process_test_cases(T):
               for each test case:
                   read N
                   read wall positions a_i
                   read Q
                   for each query:
                       read x_j, y_j
                       if (x_j, y_j) is on any wall:
                           print -1
                       else:
                           count = 0
                           for each wall position a_i:
                               if a_i > max(x_j, y_j):
                                   count += 1
                           print count

           read T
           process_test_cases(T)
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef is investigating a murder case and has identified a mafia organization with a hierarchical structure. Each member reports to exactly one other member, and the Don (the leader) reports to no one. Chef needs to find out which members are "minor criminals," defined as those who nobody reports to. The task is to identify these members based on the reporting structure provided.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Read the total number of members in the mafia.
   - Read the reporting structure, which indicates who each member reports to.
   - Create a list to track which members are reported to by others.
   - After processing the reporting structure, identify members who are not reported to by anyone (i.e., those who are not in the reporting list).
   - Output the indices of these members in ascending order.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_minor_criminals(N, reporting):
       reported_to = set()  # To track members who are reported to
       
       for i from 1 to N:
           Ri = reporting[i-1]  # Get the reporting member for i
           if Ri != 0:  # If Ri is not 0 (Don)
               reported_to.add(Ri)  # Add Ri to the set of reported members
       
       potential_killers = []  # List to store potential killers
       for i from 1 to N:
           if i not in reported_to:  # If member i is not reported to
               potential_killers.append(i)  # Add to potential killers
       
       return sorted(potential_killers)  # Return sorted list of potential killers

   N = read integer input
   reporting = read list of integers

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains one integer N.
Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

-----Output-----
Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order â€” the indices of potential killers.

-----Constraints-----

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] In this task, I was required to identify "minor criminals" in a mafia organization based on a reporting structure. The problem involved understanding a hierarchical relationship where each member reports to exactly one other member, except for the Don, who reports to no one. The goal was to find members who are not reported to by anyone.

The solution involved creating a set to track members who are reported to and then checking which members are not in that set. This approach effectively identified the potential killers. The implementation was straightforward, leveraging basic data structures like lists and sets to manage the relationships efficiently.

The final code successfully handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that the results were presented in ascending order. The solution passed all provided test cases, confirming its correctness. Key concepts included understanding hierarchical structures and using sets for efficient membership checking. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of clear data management in solving relationship-based problems. 

Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

```python
def find_minor_criminals(N, reporting):
    reported_to = set()  # To track members who are reported to
    
    for i in range(1, N + 1):  # Iterate through each member

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions

- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
n = eval(input())
r = list(map(int, input().split()))

tree = dict()
i = 1
for j in r:
 c = tree.get(j)
 if c:
  tree[j].append(i)
 else:
  tree[j] = [i]
 if not tree.get(i):
  tree[i] = []
 i += 1
s = []
for elem in tree:
 if not tree[elem]:
  s.append(str(elem))
print(' '.join(s))

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] The official solution effectively constructs a tree-like structure to represent the reporting relationships among mafia members. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Data Structure**: The solution uses a dictionary (`tree`) to map each member to a list of their direct reports. This allows for efficient tracking of who reports to whom.

2. **Building the Tree**: As it iterates through the reporting list, it checks if a member already has a list of reports. If they do, it appends the current member to that list; if not, it initializes a new list. This ensures that every member is accounted for, even if they have no reports.

3. **Identifying Potential Killers**: After constructing the tree, the solution checks each member to see if they have any reports (i.e., if their list is empty). If a member has no one reporting to them, they are added to the list of potential killers.

4. **Output**: Finally, the solution prints the indices of potential killers in a space-separated format.

The approach is efficient, as it processes the input in linear time relative to the number of members, making it suitable for the problem's constraints. My initial solution was similar in logic but could have been optimized by directly using a dictionary to track reported members instead of a set, which would have streamlined the process of identifying potential killers. 

Overall, the official solution's use of a dictionary for direct mapping and its clear separation of building the structure and querying it are valuable takeaways for future problems involving hierarchical relationships.

The main function is `find_minor_criminals`.
INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] This function identifies members who have not been reported to by anyone in a given reporting structure. It first collects all members who have been reported to by iterating through the reporting list. Then, it checks each member to see if they are absent from the set of reported members. Those who are not reported to are considered potential killers and are added to a list. Finally, the function returns a sorted list of these potential killers. The output is a list of integers representing the members who have not been reported to.

[Problem]
    Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
    Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
    There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
    Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

    -----Input-----
    The first line of input contains one integer N.
    Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

    -----Output-----
    Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order â€” the indices of potential killers.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
    - 1 â‰¤ Ri â‰¤ N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.
    - It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.

    -----Subtasks-----
    - Subtask #1 [50 points]: N â‰¤ 10000
    - Subtask #2 [50 points]: No additional constraints

    -----Example-----
    Input:
    6
    0 1 1 2 2 3

    Output:
    4 5 6

    -----Explanation-----
