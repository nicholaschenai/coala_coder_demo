He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.\nChef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.\nThere are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.\nNow, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains one integer N.\nNext line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri \u2014 the person whom the ith member reports to.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a list of space-separated integers in ascending order \u2014 the indices of potential killers.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 105\n- 1 \u2264 Ri \u2264 N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.\n- It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask #1 [50 points]: N \u2264 10000\n- Subtask #2 [50 points]: No additional constraints\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n6\n0 1 1 2 2 3\n\nOutput:\n4 5 6\n\n-----Explanation-----\nThe reporting structure:\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Each member of the mafia reports to another member, and there is a single Don who reports to no one (indicated by a reporting value of 0). The task is to identify the members of the mafia who are not reported to by anyone else, as these members are considered potential killers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To find the potential killers, we need to determine which members of the mafia do not appear as a reporting target for any other member. We can achieve this by:\n   - Creating a list to track how many members report to each member.\n   - Iterating through the reporting list to populate this tracking list.\n   - Finally, we will collect the indices of members who have a count of zero in the tracking list, as these members are not reported to by anyone.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Initialize a list 'report_count' of size N+1 with all zeros\n   For each member i from 1 to N:\n       If Ri is not 0:\n           Increment report_count[Ri] by 1\n   Initialize an empty list 'potential_killers'\n   For each member i from 1 to N:\n       If report_count[i] is 0:\n           Append i to potential_killers\n   Sort potential_killers\n   Print the elements of potential_killers as space-separated integers\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef find_potential_killers():\n    # Read the number of members\n    N = int(input())\n    # Read the reporting structure\n    R = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    # Initialize a list to count how many people report to each member\n    report_count = [0] * (N + 1)\n    \n    # Count the number of reports for each member\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        Ri = R[i - 1]  # R is 0-indexed, members are 1-indexed\n        if Ri != 0:\n            report_count[Ri] += 1\n    \n    # Find all members who are not reported to by anyone\n    potential_killers = []\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        if report_count[i] == 0:\n            potential_killers.append(i)\n    \n    # Sort the potential killers\n    potential_killers.sort()\n    \n    # Print the result as space-separated integers\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, potential_killers)))\n\n```"

The problem involved checking if Chef's position was on any wall and counting how many walls were above his maximum coordinate.\n\n    The core concept involved understanding the geometric representation of walls as line segments and how to efficiently determine the number of walls Chef would need to break through. The solution utilized a straightforward approach of iterating through wall positions and comparing them to Chef's coordinates.\n\n    The implemented solution successfully handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that if Chef's position was on a wall, it returned -1. Otherwise, it counted the walls that were above the maximum of Chef's x and y coordinates. The code was structured to read multiple test cases and queries efficiently.\n\n    Key takeaways include the importance of checking conditions before performing calculations and the efficiency of using simple comparisons to solve geometric problems. The solution was effective, and no unexpected errors occurred during implementation. The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def process_test_cases(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            walls = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            Q = int(input())\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                x_j, y_j = map(int, input().split())\n            \n                if x_j == y_j and x_j in walls:\n                    print(-1)\n                    continue\n            \n                count = 0\n                max_coord = max(x_j, y_j)\n            \n                for wall in walls:\n                    if wall > max_coord:\n                        count += 1\n            \n                print(count)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    process_test_cases(T)\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process and the final solution, which can be referenced for similar geometric problems in the future.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.\n        Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.\n\n        -----Input-----\n        - First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.\n        - The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.\n        - The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.\n        - The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.\n        - The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.\n\n        -----Output-----\n        For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line.

Each wall is represented by a line segment connecting points on the x-axis and y-axis. For each starting position of Chef, we need to check if he is on a wall, and if not, count how many walls he would need to break to reach the origin.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n           - For each test case, read the number of walls and their respective positions.\n           - For each query (Chef's starting position), check if the position lies on any wall. If it does, return -1.\n           - If not, determine how many walls Chef would need to break through to reach the origin. This can be done by checking how many wall positions are greater than the maximum of Chef's x and y coordinates.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n           ```\n           function process_test_cases(T):\n               for each test case:\n                   read N\n                   read wall positions a_i\n                   read Q\n                   for each query:\n                       read x_j, y_j\n                       if (x_j, y_j) is on any wall:\n                           print -1\n                       else:\n                           count = 0\n                           for each wall position a_i:\n                               if a_i > max(x_j, y_j):\n                                   count += 1\n                           print count\n\n           read T\n           process_test_cases(T)\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n        ```python\n        def process_test_cases(T):\n            for _ in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case\n                N = int(input())  # Read number of walls\n                walls = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read wall positions\n                Q = int(input())  # Read number of queries\n        \n                for __ in range(Q):  # Iterate over each query\n                    x_j, y_j = map(int, input().split())  # Read Chef's starting position\n            \n                    # Check if the position lies on any wall\n                    if x_j == y_j and x_j in walls:\n                        print(-1)  # Chef is on a wall\n                        continue\n            \n                    # Count how many walls Chef needs to break\n                    count = 0\n                    max_coord = max(x_j, y_j)  # Get the maximum of x and y coordinates\n            \n                    for wall in walls:  # Iterate through each wall\n                        if wall > max_coord:  # If wall is above the maximum coordinate\n                            count += 1  # Increment the count\n            \n                    print(count)  # Output the number of walls to break\n\n        # Read the number of test cases\n        T = int(input())\n        process_test_cases(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases\n        ```\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['1', '2', '1 3', '5', '0 0', '2 0', '0 4', '1 1', '1 2'] Output: [{'0'}, {'1'}, {'2'}, {'1'}, {'-1'}]\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"

This allows for efficient tracking of who reports to whom.\n\n2. **Building the Tree**: As it iterates through the reporting list, it checks if a member already has a list of reports. If they do, it appends the current member to that list; if not, it initializes a new list. This ensures that every member is accounted for, even if they have no reports.\n\n3. **Identifying Potential Killers**: After constructing the tree, the solution checks each member to see if they have any reports (i.e., if their list is empty). If a member has no one reporting to them, they are added to the list of potential killers.\n\n4. **Output**: Finally, the solution prints the indices of potential killers in a space-separated format.\n\nThe approach is efficient, as it processes the input in linear time relative to the number of members, making it suitable for the problem's constraints. My initial solution was similar in logic but could have been optimized by directly using a dictionary to track reported members instead of a set, which would have streamlined the process of identifying potential killers. \n\nOverall, the official solution's use of a dictionary for direct mapping and its clear separation of building the structure and querying it are valuable takeaways for future problems involving hierarchical relationships."

It first collects all members who have been reported to by iterating through the reporting list. Then, it checks each member to see if they are absent from the set of reported members. Those who are not reported to are considered potential killers and are added to a list. Finally, the function returns a sorted list of these potential killers. The output is a list of integers representing the members who have not been reported to.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios involving hierarchical structures where you need to identify members who do not have any subordinates or are not reported to by anyone. Such situations can arise in organizational management, criminal investigations, or any system where relationships are defined in a parent-child manner. Understanding how to identify these members can help in resource allocation, risk assessment, or in identifying potential threats in a network."
