    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   Chef is investigating a murder case and has identified a mafia organization with a hierarchical structure. Each member reports to exactly one other member, and the Don (the leader) reports to no one. Chef needs to find out which members are \"minor criminals,\" defined as those who nobody reports to. The task is to identify these members based on the reporting structure provided.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - Read the total number of members in the mafia.\n   - Read the reporting structure, which indicates who each member reports to.\n   - Create a list to track which members are reported to by others.\n   - After processing the reporting structure, identify members who are not reported to by anyone (i.e., those who are not in the reporting list).\n   - Output the indices of these members in ascending order.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function find_minor_criminals(N, reporting):\n       reported_to = set()  # To track members who are reported to\n       \n       for i from 1 to N:\n           Ri = reporting[i-1]  # Get the reporting member for i\n           if Ri != 0:  # If Ri is not 0 (Don)\n               reported_to.add(Ri)  # Add Ri to the set of reported members\n       \n       potential_killers = []  # List to store potential killers\n       for i from 1 to N:\n           if i not in reported_to:  # If member i is not reported to\n               potential_killers.append(i)  # Add to potential killers\n       \n       return sorted(potential_killers)  # Return sorted list of potential killers\n\n   N = read integer input\n   reporting = read list of integers\n   result = find_minor_criminals(N, reporting)\n   print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef find_minor_criminals(N, reporting):\n    reported_to = set()  # To track members who are reported to\n    \n    for i in range(1, N + 1):  # Iterate through each member\n        Ri = reporting[i - 1]  # Get the reporting member for i\n        if Ri != 0:  # If Ri is not 0 (Don)\n            reported_to.add(Ri)  # Add Ri to the set of reported members\n    \n    potential_killers = []  # List to store potential killers\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):  # Check each member\n        if i not in reported_to:  # If member i is not reported to\n            potential_killers.append(i)  # Add to potential killers\n    \n    return sorted(potential_killers)  # Return sorted list of potential killers\n\n# Read the number of members\nN = int(input())\n# Read the reporting structure\nreporting = list(map(int, input().split()))\n# Get the result of potential killers\nresult = find_minor_criminals(N, reporting)\n# Print the result as space-separated integers\nprint(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n```",
