The first few elements of $G$ are $[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, \\ldots]$. Do you know the recurrence relation for the Golomb sequence?

A self-describing sequence, isn't it?\nMr. Strange wants to learn CP, so he asked Chef, who is one of the best competitive programmers in the world, to teach him. Chef decided to test his ability by giving him the following task.\nFind the sum of squares of the $L$-th through $R$-th term of the Golomb sequence, i.e. $S = \\sum_{i=L}^R G_i^2$. Since the sum can be quite large, compute it modulo $10^9+7$.\nCan you help Mr. Strange carry out this task given to him by his teacher?\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.

Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Precomputation**: The solution precomputes the Golomb sequence values up to a certain limit (in this case, \\(10^6 + 100\\)). This allows for quick access to the values during query processing, significantly reducing the time complexity for each test case.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming**: The Golomb sequence is generated using a dynamic programming approach, where each term is computed based on previously computed terms. This avoids redundant calculations and allows for efficient storage of results.\n\n3. **Prefix Sums**: The solution maintains a prefix sum array (`prefix_storer`) that stores cumulative sums of the squares of the Golomb sequence terms. This enables quick calculation of the sum of squares over any range \\([L, R]\\) by simply subtracting the prefix sums.\n\n4. **Binary Search for Upper Bound**: The function `find_upper_bound` is used to efficiently find the index in the `bin_storer` array that corresponds to the upper limit of the query. This is crucial for determining how many terms contribute to the sum of squares for a given range.\n\n5. **Query Handling**: The `fire_query` function utilizes the precomputed data to quickly compute the result for each query by leveraging the prefix sums and the upper bound index.\n\nOverall, the official solution is significantly more efficient than the initial approach, especially for large values of \\(L\\) and \\(R\\). The use of precomputation, dynamic programming, and prefix sums allows it to handle up to \\(10^5\\) queries efficiently, which is essential given the problem constraints. \n\nIn contrast, my initial approach relied on recursive computation of the Golomb sequence, which would be infeasible for large indices due to excessive time complexity and potential stack overflow issues. The official solution's method of precomputing values and using efficient data structures is a valuable lesson for handling similar problems in the future."

It initializes a memoization dictionary to store previously computed values for efficiency. For each integer in the range from L to R, it retrieves the corresponding Golomb term, squares it, and adds it to a running total. The total is kept within bounds by applying a modulo operation with \\(10^9 + 7\\).

Understanding the Golomb sequence and its properties can help in solving problems that require efficient computation of terms in large ranges, especially when the constraints are high, such as in this problem where L and R can go up to 10^10. It also highlights the importance of memoization in optimizing recursive functions to handle large inputs effectively.
