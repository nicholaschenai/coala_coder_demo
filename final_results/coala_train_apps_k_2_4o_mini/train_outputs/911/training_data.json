    "summary": "In this task, I was required to compute the sum of squares of terms in the Golomb sequence for multiple test cases, where the indices could be as large as \\(10^{10}\\). The Golomb sequence is defined recursively, which posed a challenge for direct computation due to the potential size of the indices.\n\nThe key insight was to use memoization to store previously computed values of the Golomb sequence, allowing for efficient retrieval and reducing redundant calculations. The recurrence relation \\(G_{n+1} = 1 + G_{n+1 - G_{G_n}}\\) was crucial for generating the sequence terms. \n\nThe final implementation involved defining a `golomb` function that utilized a dictionary for memoization and a `sum_of_squares` function to compute the required sums over the specified ranges. The solution effectively handled the constraints and produced correct results for the provided test cases.\n\nHere\u2019s the core code snippet for reference:\n\n```python\ndef golomb(n, memo):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    if n in memo:\n        return memo[n]\n    result = 1 + golomb(n - golomb(golomb(n - 1, memo), memo), memo)\n    memo[n] = result\n    return result\n\ndef sum_of_squares(L, R):\n    memo = {}\n    total_sum = 0\n    for i in range(L, R + 1):\n        g_i = golomb(i, memo)\n        total_sum += g_i * g_i\n        total_sum %= (10**9 + 7)\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of optimizing recursive functions with memoization, especially when dealing with large input sizes.",
    "reflection": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach to compute the sum of squares of the Golomb sequence terms over large ranges, which is crucial given the constraints of the problem. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Precomputation**: The solution precomputes the Golomb sequence values up to a certain limit (in this case, \\(10^6 + 100\\)). This allows for quick access to the values during query processing, significantly reducing the time complexity for each test case.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming**: The Golomb sequence is generated using a dynamic programming approach, where each term is computed based on previously computed terms. This avoids redundant calculations and allows for efficient storage of results.\n\n3. **Prefix Sums**: The solution maintains a prefix sum array (`prefix_storer`) that stores cumulative sums of the squares of the Golomb sequence terms. This enables quick calculation of the sum of squares over any range \\([L, R]\\) by simply subtracting the prefix sums.\n\n4. **Binary Search for Upper Bound**: The function `find_upper_bound` is used to efficiently find the index in the `bin_storer` array that corresponds to the upper limit of the query. This is crucial for determining how many terms contribute to the sum of squares for a given range.\n\n5. **Query Handling**: The `fire_query` function utilizes the precomputed data to quickly compute the result for each query by leveraging the prefix sums and the upper bound index.\n\nOverall, the official solution is significantly more efficient than the initial approach, especially for large values of \\(L\\) and \\(R\\). The use of precomputation, dynamic programming, and prefix sums allows it to handle up to \\(10^5\\) queries efficiently, which is essential given the problem constraints. \n\nIn contrast, my initial approach relied on recursive computation of the Golomb sequence, which would be infeasible for large indices due to excessive time complexity and potential stack overflow issues. The official solution's method of precomputing values and using efficient data structures is a valuable lesson for handling similar problems in the future.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: sum_of_squares]\nThis function calculates the sum of the squares of the Golomb sequence terms from a given lower bound L to an upper bound R. It initializes a memoization dictionary to store previously computed values for efficiency. For each integer in the range from L to R, it retrieves the corresponding Golomb term, squares it, and adds it to a running total. The total is kept within bounds by applying a modulo operation with \\(10^9 + 7\\). Finally, it returns the computed sum of squares for the specified range.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in competitive programming and algorithm design, particularly when dealing with sequences defined by recurrence relations. Understanding the Golomb sequence and its properties can help in solving problems that require efficient computation of terms in large ranges, especially when the constraints are high, such as in this problem where L and R can go up to 10^10. It also highlights the importance of memoization in optimizing recursive functions to handle large inputs effectively. Additionally, this knowledge can be applied in mathematical research or computer science education when discussing self-describing sequences and their applications."
