    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to generate a specific pattern of binary numbers based on an integer input K for multiple test cases. For each test case, we need to print K lines, where each line contains K binary numbers. The binary numbers should be generated in a specific way, starting from 1 and incrementing in binary format.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   For each test case, we will read the integer K. We will then generate K lines of output. Each line will contain K binary numbers, starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent number. The first line will contain the first K binary numbers, the second line will contain the next K binary numbers, and so on. We need to ensure that the output is formatted correctly, with appropriate spacing between test cases.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function generate_pattern(T):\n       for each test case from 1 to T:\n           read K\n           for i from 0 to K-1:\n               initialize an empty line\n               for j from 0 to K-1:\n                   calculate the binary number for (i * K + j)\n                   append the binary number to the line\n               print the line\n           if this is not the last test case:\n               print a blank line\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef generate_pattern(T):\n    for t in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case\n        K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case\n        for i in range(K):  # For each line from 0 to K-1\n            line = []  # Initialize an empty list to hold binary numbers\n            for j in range(K):  # Create a line of K binary numbers\n                # Calculate the binary number for (i * K + j)\n                binary_number = bin(i * K + j)[2:]  # Convert to binary and remove '0b'\n                line.append(binary_number)  # Append the binary number to the line\n            print(\" \".join(line))  # Print the generated line as a space-separated string\n        if t < T - 1:  # If this is not the last test case, print a blank line\n            print()  # Print a blank line to separate test cases\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ngenerate_pattern(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases\n```",
