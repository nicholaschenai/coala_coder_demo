    "raw_msg": "Based on the insights and corrections needed, here is the revised solution that correctly generates the required binary pattern for each test case, ensuring proper formatting without extra blank lines:\n\n```python\ndef generate_pattern(T):\n    for t in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case\n        K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case\n        for i in range(K):  # For each line from 0 to K-1\n            line = []  # Initialize an empty list to hold binary numbers\n            for j in range(K):  # Create a line of K binary numbers\n                # Calculate the binary number for (i * K + j + 1) to start from 1\n                binary_number = bin(i * K + j + 1)[2:]  # Convert to binary and remove '0b'\n                line.append(binary_number)  # Append the binary number to the line\n            print(\" \".join(line))  # Print the generated line as a space-separated string\n        if t < T - 1:  # If this is not the last test case, print a blank line\n            print()  # Print a blank line to separate test cases\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ngenerate_pattern(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases\n```\n\n### Key Changes Made:\n- The binary numbers are generated starting from 1, ensuring that '0' is not included.\n- The output is formatted correctly with space-separated binary numbers for each line.\n- A blank line is printed only between test cases, not after the last test case. \n\nThis code should now meet the requirements and pass all tests.",
