-----Input:-----
- The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
- Next Q line contains two number I and K.

-----Explanation:-----
For N=3

total subsets are:

{1}

{2}

{3}

{1,2}

{1,3}

{2,3}

{1,2,3}

Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the number of subsets of the first N natural numbers (1 to N) where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of that subset. We will handle multiple test cases and queries efficiently, as the constraints are quite large.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each test case, we will read the values of N and Q.
   - For each query, we need to determine how many subsets exist where the number I is at position K.
   - To do this, we can break down the problem:
     - If I is at position K, then there must be K-1 numbers less than I in the subset.
     - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than I.
   - We can use combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of ways to choose the required numbers:
     - The number of ways to choose K-1 numbers from the first I-1 numbers (those less than I).
     - The number of ways to choose any number of elements from the remaining numbers (those greater than I).
   - We will precompute factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently calculate combinations.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n):
       create an array factorial of size max_n + 1
       create an array inverse_factorial of size max_n + 1

       for each test case:
           read N, Q
           for each query:
               read I, K
               if K > I or K < 1:
                   print 0
                   continue

               result = (count_less * count_greater) % MOD

        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).

        Note f([1]) = 0.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
        - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
        Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
           We need to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function, which sums the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation, equals a given value K. If no such permutation exists, we should return -1.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
           To solve this problem, we need to understand how the function f(P) is calculated. The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is achieved when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the maximum possible sum of adjacent maximums. The minimum value of f(P) is 0, which occurs when N is 1. We can derive the maximum possible value of f(P) as follows:
           - For N = 1, f(P) = 0.
           - For N = 2, f(P) = 2.
           - For N = 3, f(P) = 4.
           - For N = 4, f(P) = 8.
           - For N = 5, f(P) = 12.
           - The pattern shows that the maximum value of f(P) for N is (N-1) * N / 2, which is the sum of the first (N-1) integers.
   
           If K is greater than this maximum value or less than the minimum value, we return -1. If K is achievable, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to meet the exact value of K.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
           ```
           function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
               for each test_case in test_cases:
                   N, K = test_case
                   max_value = (N - 1) * N // 2
                   if K < 0 or K > max_value:
                       print -1
                   else:
                       create a descending list from N to 1
                       current_sum = max_value
                       while current_sum > K:
                           find the first two adjacent elements in the list
                           swap them to decrease the current_sum
                           update current_sum accordingly
                       print the resulting permutation

    [Task]:
        It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.
        However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:
        123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \, 2 \, 3 \quad    1 \, 3 \, 2 \quad     2 \, 1 \, 3 \quad     2 \, 3 \, 1 \quad     3 \, 1 \, 2 \quad     3 \, 2 \, 1 
        The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, â€¦, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.

        -----Input:-----
        The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$.

        -----Output:-----
        The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.

        -----Constraints:-----
        - $1 \leq N \leq 1000$.
        - $1 \leq K \leq 10$.

        -----Sample input-----
        3 2
        3 1 2
        2 3 1

        -----Sample output-----
        3 2 1
        3 1 2

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
           We need to find the next permutation of a given sequence of numbers from 1 to N in lexicographic order. Given multiple permutations, we will output the next permutation for each one.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
           To find the next permutation in lexicographic order, we can follow these steps:
           - Identify the longest suffix that is non-increasing (i.e., find the rightmost pair where the first number is less than the second).
           - If such a pair is found, swap the first number of this pair with the smallest number in the suffix that is larger than it.
           - Finally, reverse the suffix to get the next permutation.
           - If no such pair exists, it means we are at the last permutation, and we should return the smallest permutation (sorted order).

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
           ```
           function next_permutation(permutation):
               # Step 1: Find the largest index i such that permutation[i] < permutation[i + 1]
               i = length(permutation) - 2
               while i >= 0 and permutation[i] >= permutation[i + 1]:
                   i -= 1
       
               if i == -1:
                   # This is the last permutation, return the sorted order
                   return sorted(permutation)
       
               # Step 2: Find the largest index j greater than i such that permutation[i] < permutation[j]
               j = length(permutation) - 1
               while permutation[j] <= permutation[i]:
                   j -= 1
       
               # Step 3: Swap the value of permutation[i] with that of permutation[j]
               swap(permutation[i], permutation[j])
       
               # Step 4: Reverse the sequence from permutation[i + 1] to the end
               reverse(permutation, i + 1, end)
       
               return permutation

           function main():
               read N and K
               for each permutation in K:
                   result = next_permutation(permutation)
                   print(result)
           ```

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} such that a specific number I appears at the K-th position in the sorted order of the subset. We will handle multiple queries for each test case, and the results should be printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to understand how to count the valid subsets:
   - For a number I to be at the K-th position in a subset, there must be exactly K-1 numbers that are less than I in the subset.
   - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than I.
   - We can use combinatorial counting to determine how many ways we can choose K-1 numbers from the numbers less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I.
   - The total number of valid subsets can be calculated using combinations and powers of 2.

-----Explanation:-----
For N=3

total subsets are:

{1}

{2}

{3}

{1,2}

{1,3}

{2,3}

{1,2,3}

Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} such that a specific number I appears at the K-th position in the sorted order of the subset. We will handle multiple queries for each test case, and the results should be printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to understand how to count the valid subsets:
   - For a number I to be at the K-th position in a subset, there must be exactly K-1 numbers that are less than I in the subset.
   - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than I.
   - We can use combinatorial counting to determine how many ways we can choose K-1 numbers from the numbers less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I.
   - The total number of valid subsets can be calculated using combinations and powers of 2.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at the K-th position in the sorted order of the subset. The solution required combinatorial counting, specifically using combinations and powers of 2 to account for the elements less than and greater than I.

Key concepts included:
- Understanding that for I to be at the K-th position, there must be exactly K-1 elements less than I in the subset.
- Using precomputed factorials and their inverses to efficiently calculate combinations, which is crucial given the constraints (up to 4000 for N and up to 1,000,000 queries).

The implemented solution involved:
1. Precomputing factorials and their modular inverses using Fermat's little theorem.
2. For each query, checking if K is valid (i.e., K â‰¤ I) and calculating the number of valid subsets using the formula for combinations and powers of 2.

The final code was structured to read input, process multiple test cases, and output results efficiently. The solution passed all provided test cases, demonstrating its correctness and efficiency. 

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of combinatorial mathematics in subset problems and the utility of precomputation for handling large input sizes efficiently.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] The official solution provides a more straightforward approach to solving the problem, focusing on combinatorial counting without the need for precomputation of factorials and inverse factorials. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Direct Calculation of Combinations**: Instead of precomputing factorials, the official solution calculates combinations directly within the loop for each query. This is done using a simple iterative method to compute the numerator and denominator of the combination formula \( C(n, k) \).

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution checks if \( K > I \) right at the beginning of each query. If true, it immediately returns 0, as it's impossible for the I-th number to be in the K-th position if K exceeds I.

3. **Efficient Power Calculation**: The solution uses \( 2^{(N-I)} \) to count the subsets of numbers greater than I, which is a crucial part of the calculation. This is done efficiently without needing to store powers of 2 in advance.

4. **Iterative Factorial Calculation**: The solution calculates the factorial values needed for combinations iteratively, which avoids the overhead of storing large arrays of factorials. This is particularly useful given the constraints, as it reduces space complexity.

5. **Modular Arithmetic**: The final result is computed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers, ensuring that the solution remains efficient and within bounds.

Overall, the official solution is effective in its simplicity and directness, focusing on the essential calculations needed for each query without unnecessary precomputation. This approach is particularly beneficial given the constraints of the problem, allowing it to handle up to 1,000,000 queries efficiently. 

In contrast, my initial solution involved precomputing factorials and inverse factorials, which, while mathematically sound, added unnecessary complexity and overhead for this specific problem. The iterative approach used in the official solution is more efficient in both time and space for the given constraints.

    Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
    number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
    The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


    -----Input:-----
    - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
    - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
    - Next Q line contains two number I and K.

    -----Output:-----
    For each test case print required answer.

    -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
    - 1<=T<=5
    - 1<=N, K<=4000
    - 1<=Q<=1000000
    Subtask 3: 5 points
    - 1<=T<=5
    - 1<=N, K<=16
    - 1<=Q<=1000
    Subtask 1: 25 points
    - T=1
    - 1<=N, K<=4000
    - 1<=Q<=100000
    Subtask 2: 70 points
    - Original Constraints.

    -----Example:-----
    Input:

    1

    3 3

    1 2

    2 1

    3 2

    Output:

    0

    2

    2

    -----Explanation:-----
    For N=3

    total subsets are:

    {1}

    {2}

    {3}

    {1,2}

    {1,3}

    {2,3}

    {1,2,3}

    Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

    For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

    Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.
