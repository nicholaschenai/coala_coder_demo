The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is achieved when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the maximum possible sum of adjacent maximums. The minimum value of f(P) is 0, which occurs when N is 1. We can derive the maximum possible value of f(P) as follows:\n           - For N = 1, f(P) = 0.\n           - For N = 2, f(P) = 2.\n           - For N = 3, f(P) = 4.\n           - For N = 4, f(P) = 8.\n           - For N = 5, f(P) = 12.\n           - The pattern shows that the maximum value of f(P) for N is (N-1) * N / 2, which is the sum of the first (N-1) integers.\n   \n           If K is greater than this maximum value or less than the minimum value, we return -1. If K is achievable, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to meet the exact value of K.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n           ```\n           function find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n               for each test_case in test_cases:\n                   N, K = test_case\n                   max_value = (N - 1) * N // 2\n                   if K < 0 or K > max_value:\n                       print -1\n                   else:\n                       create a descending list from N to 1\n                       current_sum = max_value\n                       while current_sum > K:\n                           find the first two adjacent elements in the list\n                           swap them to decrease the current_sum\n                           update current_sum accordingly\n                       print the resulting permutation\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n        ```python\n        def find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for case in test_cases:\n                N, K = case\n                # Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P)\n                max_value = (N - 1) * N // 2\n        \n                # Check if K is out of bounds\n                if K < 0 or K > max_value:\n                    results.append(-1)\n                    continue\n        \n                # Start with the descending permutation\n                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                current_sum = max_value\n        \n                # Adjust the permutation to match K\n                for i in range(N - 1):\n                    if current_sum == K:\n                        break\n                    # Calculate the potential new sum if we swap\n                    new_sum = current_sum - (permutation[i] + permutation[i + 1]) + max(permutation[i + 1], permutation[i])\n                    if new_sum >= K:\n                        # Swap the elements to decrease the sum\n                        permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                        current_sum = new_sum\n        \n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n            # Print all results at once for efficiency\n            print(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)))\n\n        # Read input\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n\n        T = int(data[0])  # Number of test cases\n        test_cases = []\n\n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N, K = map(int, data[i].split())\n            test_cases.append((N, K))\n\n        # Call the function with the parsed input\n        find_permutation(T, test_cases)\n        ```\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n        None\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: ['3', '4 12', '2 2', '5 14'] Expected output: [{'-1'}, {'2', '1'}, {'4', '5', '3', '2', '1'}] # Execution output: ['-1', '-1', '-1']\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Failure\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, \u2026, n$.
