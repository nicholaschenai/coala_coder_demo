    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We have an infinite binary tree where each node has a specific labeling and structure. Given two nodes `u` and `v`, we need to determine how many pairs of nodes `(w, t)` exist such that the path taken to traverse from `w` to `t` is identical to the path taken from `u` to `v`. The queries will provide a maximum node label `n`, and we need to count valid pairs for each query.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of the binary tree and how to determine the path between two nodes. The path from any node to another can be derived by moving up to their lowest common ancestor (LCA) and then down to the target node. The key steps are:\n   - Find the LCA of nodes `u` and `v`.\n   - Count how many nodes can be paired with `u` and `v` such that they share the same path to their LCA.\n   - The number of valid pairs `(w, t)` will depend on the number of nodes that can be reached from the LCA.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function find_lca(u, v):\n       while u != v:\n           if u > v:\n               u = u // 2\n           else:\n               v = v // 2\n       return u\n\n   function count_pairs(n, u, v):\n       lca = find_lca(u, v)\n       # Count nodes in the subtree rooted at lca\n       count = 0\n       for i from 1 to n:\n           if is_in_subtree(i, lca):\n               count += 1\n       return count\n\n   function main():\n       read Q\n       for each query:\n           read n, u, v\n           result = count_pairs(n, u, v)\n           print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef find_lca(u, v):\n    # Find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes u and v\n    while u != v:\n        if u > v:\n            u //= 2\n        else:\n            v //= 2\n    return u\n\ndef count_pairs(n, u, v):\n    # Find the LCA of u and v\n    lca = find_lca(u, v)\n    \n    # Count the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at lca\n    # The subtree includes all nodes from lca to n\n    # The number of nodes in the subtree is the count of nodes from lca to n\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if is_in_subtree(i, lca):\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef is_in_subtree(node, lca):\n    # Check if the node is in the subtree rooted at lca\n    while node > 0:\n        if node == lca:\n            return True\n        node //= 2\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    Q = int(data[0])  # Number of queries\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, Q + 1):\n        n, u, v = map(int, data[i].split())\n        result = count_pairs(n, u, v)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    # Print all results for each query\n    print(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)))\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n```",
