## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are playing a very popular game called Cubecraft. Initially, you have one stick and want to craft $k$ torches. One torch can be crafted using one stick and one coal.

Hopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:  exchange $1$ stick for $x$ sticks (you lose $1$ stick and gain $x$ sticks).  exchange $y$ sticks for $1$ coal (you lose $y$ sticks and gain $1$ coal). 

During one trade, you can use only one of these two trade offers. You can use each trade offer any number of times you want to, in any order.

Your task is to find the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $k$ ($2 \le x \le 10^9$; $1 \le y, k \le 10^9$) â€” the number of sticks you can buy with one stick, the number of sticks required to buy one coal and the number of torches you need, respectively.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

INFO - [Task id] 48 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   You start with one stick and want to craft a certain number of torches, where each torch requires one stick and one coal. You can trade one stick to get a certain number of sticks (x) or trade a certain number of sticks (y) to get one coal. The goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft the required number of torches.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals. Since you start with one stick, you need to acquire `k - 1` additional sticks. For the coals, you need to trade `k * y` sticks to get `k` coals. Therefore, the total number of sticks needed is `k - 1 + k * y`. After trading for the required sticks, you can then trade for the coals. The number of trades can be calculated based on how many sticks you can get from each trade and how many trades you need to perform to reach the required number of sticks.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function minimum_trades(t, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           x, y, k = test_case
           total_sticks_needed = k - 1 + k * y
           trades_for_sticks = ceil(total_sticks_needed / (x - 1))
           total_trades = trades_for_sticks + k
           print(total_trades)

        trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)  # Using integer division to round up
        
        # Total trades is the trades for sticks plus the trades for k coals

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host given the number of problems created by his setters, the number of problems required for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the number of days available to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for summation and list handling.

    The final implementation successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code was structured to first read input values, process each test case, and then output the results. Key strategies included using integer division to determine the number of contests and the `min` function to ensure the result did not exceed the available days. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of clear problem breakdown and efficient use of built-in functions in Python. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]
            A = case[3]
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))

    max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases)
    ```
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute exactly \( K \) amount of money to \( N \) minions based on their individual demands. The key points to consider were whether the total demand from the minions matched \( K \), was less than \( K \), or exceeded \( K \).

    Initially, the approach focused on checking if the total demand equaled \( K \) and incorrectly assumed that if the total demand was less than \( K \), Gru could always distribute the remaining money. This led to incorrect outputs, particularly in cases where the remaining money could not be distributed without exceeding individual demands.

    The correct logic should have been:
    1. If the total demand equals \( K \), print "YES".
    2. If the total demand is less than \( K \), print "YES" since Gru can distribute the remaining money.
    3. If the total demand exceeds \( K \), print "NO".

    Despite multiple attempts to refine the logic, the solution consistently failed to account for the distribution constraints properly. The final code snippet aimed to address these issues but still produced incorrect results, indicating a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.

    ### Key Takeaways:
    - Ensure to fully understand the constraints of distribution when dealing with remaining amounts.
    - Always validate the logic against edge cases to ensure correctness.
    - The problem highlighted the importance of careful condition checking in scenarios involving sums and distributions. 

    ### Final Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            K = case[1]
            demands = case[2]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
        
            if total_demand == K:
                print("YES")
            elif total_demand < K:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        demands = list(map(int, input().split()))

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are playing a very popular game called Cubecraft. Initially, you have one stick and want to craft $k$ torches. One torch can be crafted using one stick and one coal.

Hopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:  exchange $1$ stick for $x$ sticks (you lose $1$ stick and gain $x$ sticks).  exchange $y$ sticks for $1$ coal (you lose $y$ sticks and gain $1$ coal). 

During one trade, you can use only one of these two trade offers. You can use each trade offer any number of times you want to, in any order.

Your task is to find the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $k$ ($2 \le x \le 10^9$; $1 \le y, k \le 10^9$) â€” the number of sticks you can buy with one stick, the number of sticks required to buy one coal and the number of torches you need, respectively.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 48 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   You start with one stick and want to craft a certain number of torches, each requiring one stick and one coal. You can trade sticks for more sticks or trade sticks for coal. The goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft the desired number of torches.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals. Since you start with one stick, you need to acquire `k - 1` additional sticks. To get `k` coals, you need `k * y` sticks (since each coal requires `y` sticks). Therefore, the total number of sticks needed is `k - 1 + k * y`. After calculating the total sticks needed, you can determine how many trades are required to get that number of sticks, considering that each trade gives you `x - 1` additional sticks (since you lose one stick in the trade). The total number of trades can be calculated by dividing the total sticks needed by the number of additional sticks gained per trade.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function min_trades(t, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           x, y, k = test_case
           total_sticks_needed = k - 1 + k * y
           additional_sticks_per_trade = x - 1
           trades_for_sticks = ceil(total_sticks_needed / additional_sticks_per_trade)
           total_trades = trades_for_sticks + k

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 48 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft a specified number of torches in a game scenario. Each torch requires one stick and one coal, and the player can trade sticks for more sticks or for coal. The key was to calculate the total number of sticks needed and the trades required to acquire them.

The solution involved breaking down the requirements: for `k` torches, you need `k` coals and `k - 1` additional sticks (since you start with one stick). The total number of sticks required was calculated as `k - 1 + k * y`, where `y` is the number of sticks needed for one coal. The number of additional sticks gained per trade was `x - 1`, leading to the calculation of the number of trades needed to gather the required sticks.

The final implementation was straightforward and efficient, handling up to 20,000 test cases with large input values. The use of integer division to calculate the number of trades was crucial for performance. The solution passed all provided test cases, confirming its correctness.

Key takeaway: Understanding how to break down the problem into manageable parts and calculating the necessary trades based on the requirements was essential for solving this problem efficiently.

## Official solution

    x,y,k = list(map(int,input().split()))
    print(k + (y * k + k - 1 +x-2) // (x - 1))


INFO - [Task id] 48 [generation text] The official solution effectively simplifies the problem by directly calculating the total number of trades needed in a single line. The key insight is recognizing that the total number of trades can be derived from the formula:

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: For each torch, you need one stick and one coal. To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals. Since you start with one stick, you need `k - 1` additional sticks.

2. **Calculating Total Sticks Needed**: To obtain `k` coals, you need `k * y` sticks. Therefore, the total number of sticks required is `k - 1 + k * y`.

3. **Trade Calculation**: Each trade allows you to exchange one stick for `x` sticks, effectively giving you `x - 1` additional sticks. The formula `(y * k + k - 1 + x - 2) // (x - 1)` calculates the number of trades needed to acquire the required sticks, and `k` is added to account for the trades needed to obtain the coals.

4. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient as it computes the result in constant time for each test case, making it suitable for the upper limits of the input constraints.

In contrast, my initial approach involved multiple steps and calculations, which could be simplified into a single formula. The official solution's compactness and clarity make it easier to understand and implement, highlighting the importance of recognizing patterns in problem-solving.
