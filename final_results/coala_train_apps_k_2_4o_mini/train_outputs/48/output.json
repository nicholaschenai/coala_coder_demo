    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   You start with one stick and want to craft a certain number of torches, each requiring one stick and one coal. You can trade sticks for more sticks or trade sticks for coal. The goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft the desired number of torches.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals. Since you start with one stick, you need to acquire `k - 1` additional sticks. To get `k` coals, you need `k * y` sticks (since each coal requires `y` sticks). Therefore, the total number of sticks needed is `k - 1 + k * y`. After calculating the total sticks needed, you can determine how many trades are required to get that number of sticks, considering that each trade gives you `x - 1` additional sticks (since you lose one stick in the trade). The total number of trades can be calculated by dividing the total sticks needed by the number of additional sticks gained per trade.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function min_trades(t, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           x, y, k = test_case\n           total_sticks_needed = k - 1 + k * y\n           additional_sticks_per_trade = x - 1\n           trades_for_sticks = ceil(total_sticks_needed / additional_sticks_per_trade)\n           total_trades = trades_for_sticks + k\n           print(total_trades\n\n   read t\n   test_cases = []\n   for i from 1 to t:\n       read x, y, k\n       append (x, y, k) to test_cases\n   min_trades(t, test_cases)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef min_trades(t, test_cases):\n    for case in test_cases:\n        x, y, k = case\n        # Calculate the total number of sticks needed\n        total_sticks_needed = k - 1 + k * y\n        # Calculate the number of additional sticks gained per trade\n        additional_sticks_per_trade = x - 1\n        # Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required sticks\n        trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed + additional_sticks_per_trade - 1) // additional_sticks_per_trade\n        # Total trades is the trades for sticks plus the k trades for coal\n        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + k\n        print(total_trades)\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nt = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(t):\n    # Read x, y, k for each test case\n    x, y, k = map(int, input().split())\n    test_cases.append((x, y, k))\n\n# Call the function to calculate and print the minimum trades\nmin_trades(t, test_cases)\n```",
