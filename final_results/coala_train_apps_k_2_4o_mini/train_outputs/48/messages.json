Initially, you have one stick and want to craft $k$ torches. One torch can be crafted using one stick and one coal.\n\nHopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:  exchange $1$ stick for $x$ sticks (you lose $1$ stick and gain $x$ sticks).  exchange $y$ sticks for $1$ coal (you lose $y$ sticks and gain $1$ coal). \n\nDuring one trade, you can use only one of these two trade offers. You can use each trade offer any number of times you want to, in any order.\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe only line of the test case contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $k$ ($2 \\le x \\le 10^9$; $1 \\le y, k \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the number of sticks you can buy with one stick, the number of sticks required to buy one coal and the number of torches you need, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches.

You can trade one stick to get a certain number of sticks (x) or trade a certain number of sticks (y) to get one coal. The goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft the required number of torches.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals. Since you start with one stick, you need to acquire `k - 1` additional sticks. For the coals, you need to trade `k * y` sticks to get `k` coals. Therefore, the total number of sticks needed is `k - 1 + k * y`. After trading for the required sticks, you can then trade for the coals. The number of trades can be calculated based on how many sticks you can get from each trade and how many trades you need to perform to reach the required number of sticks.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function minimum_trades(t, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           x, y, k = test_case\n           total_sticks_needed = k - 1 + k * y\n           trades_for_sticks = ceil(total_sticks_needed / (x - 1))\n           total_trades = trades_for_sticks + k\n           print(total_trades)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef minimum_trades(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for i in range(t):\n        x, y, k = test_cases[i]\n        \n        # Calculate the total number of sticks needed\n        total_sticks_needed = k - 1 + k * y\n        \n        # Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required sticks\n        # Each trade gives (x - 1) additional sticks\n        trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)  # Using integer division to round up\n        \n        # Total trades is the trades for sticks plus the trades for k coals\n        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + k\n        \n        # Store the result for this test case\n        results.append(total_trades)\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Read input\nt = int(input())\ntest_cases = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(t)]\n\n# Call the function with the input\nminimum_trades(t, test_cases)\n```"

The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the number of days available to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for summation and list handling.\n\n    The final implementation successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code was structured to first read input values, process each test case, and then output the results. Key strategies included using integer division to determine the number of contests and the `min` function to ensure the result did not exceed the available days. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of clear problem breakdown and efficient use of built-in functions in Python. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n            A = case[3]\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))\n\n    max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute exactly \\( K \\) amount of money to \\( N \\) minions based on their individual demands. The key points to consider were whether the total demand from the minions matched \\( K \\), was less than \\( K \\), or exceeded \\( K \\).\n\n    Initially, the approach focused on checking if the total demand equaled \\( K \\) and incorrectly assumed that if the total demand was less than \\( K \\), Gru could always distribute the remaining money. This led to incorrect outputs, particularly in cases where the remaining money could not be distributed without exceeding individual demands.\n\n    The correct logic should have been:\n    1. If the total demand equals \\( K \\), print \"YES\".\n    2. If the total demand is less than \\( K \\), print \"YES\" since Gru can distribute the remaining money.\n    3. If the total demand exceeds \\( K \\), print \"NO\".\n\n    Despite multiple attempts to refine the logic, the solution consistently failed to account for the distribution constraints properly. The final code snippet aimed to address these issues but still produced incorrect results, indicating a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.\n\n    ### Key Takeaways:\n    - Ensure to fully understand the constraints of distribution when dealing with remaining amounts.\n    - Always validate the logic against edge cases to ensure correctness.\n    - The problem highlighted the importance of careful condition checking in scenarios involving sums and distributions. \n\n    ### Final Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            K = case[1]\n            demands = case[2]\n            total_demand = sum(demands)\n        \n            if total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            elif total_demand < K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        demands = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, demands))\n\n    can_distribute_money(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the core concepts, strategies attempted, and the errors encountered during the problem-solving process.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
