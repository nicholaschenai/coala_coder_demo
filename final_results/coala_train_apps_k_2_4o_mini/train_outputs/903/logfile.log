INFO - [Task id] 903 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to determine the position on the x-axis (the front wall of the classroom) where a mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's smile. Kabir and Tara are positioned at given coordinates in a 2D space, and we need to calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror based on their positions.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the position of the mirror, we can use the concept of reflection. The mirror's position on the x-axis should be such that the angle of incidence (the angle at which Kabir's line of sight hits the mirror) is equal to the angle of reflection (the angle at which the light reflects towards Tara). This can be calculated using the formula derived from the geometry of the situation. The x-coordinate of the mirror can be found using the formula:
   \[
   x_{mirror} = \frac{x1 + x2}{2} - \frac{(y1 - y2) \cdot (x1 - x2)}{2 \cdot (y1 + y2)}
   \]
   This formula takes into account the positions of Kabir and Tara and gives us the correct x-coordinate for the mirror.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_mirror_position(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read x1, y1
           read x2, y2
           calculate x_mirror using the formula
           store x_mirror in results
       return results
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def find_mirror_position(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    
    for i in range(T):
        # Read Kabir's coordinates
        x1, y1 = test_cases[i][0]
        # Read Tara's coordinates
        x2, y2 = test_cases[i][1]
        
        # Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror using the derived formula
        x_mirror = (x1 + x2) / 2 - ((y1 - y2) * (x1 - x2)) / (2 * (y1 + y2))
        
        # Store the result formatted to 2 decimal places
        results.append(f"{x_mirror:.2f}")

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine how many walls he needs to break to reach Dr. Doof, based on given wall positions and Chef's starting coordinates. The problem involved checking if Chef's position was on any wall and counting how many walls were above his maximum coordinate.

    The core concept involved understanding the geometric representation of walls as line segments and how to efficiently determine the number of walls Chef would need to break through. The solution utilized a straightforward approach of iterating through wall positions and comparing them to Chef's coordinates.

    The implemented solution successfully handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that if Chef's position was on a wall, it returned -1. Otherwise, it counted the walls that were above the maximum of Chef's x and y coordinates. The code was structured to read multiple test cases and queries efficiently.

    Key takeaways include the importance of checking conditions before performing calculations and the efficiency of using simple comparisons to solve geometric problems. The solution was effective, and no unexpected errors occurred during implementation. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def process_test_cases(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            walls = list(map(int, input().split()))
            Q = int(input())
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                x_j, y_j = map(int, input().split())
            
                if x_j == y_j and x_j in walls:
                    print(-1)
                    continue
            
                count = 0
                max_coord = max(x_j, y_j)
            
                for wall in walls:
                    if wall > max_coord:
                        count += 1
            
                print(count)

    T = int(input())
    process_test_cases(T)
    ```

[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine if there are two zebras in a jungle that spit at each other based on their positions and spit distances. The solution involved using a dictionary to map each zebra's position to the position it spits to. The core concept was to check for reciprocal spitting, meaning if zebra A spits to zebra B, then zebra B must spit back to zebra A.

    The approach was straightforward: read the input data, store the positions and their target spit positions in a dictionary, and then check for each zebra if its target position exists in the dictionary and if it spits back to the original position. This method efficiently checks for the required condition in linear time.

    The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test case. The code snippet used is as follows:

    ```python
    def find_spitting_zebras(t):
        positions = {}
        for _ in range(t):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            target_position = a + b
            positions[a] = target_position
    
        for a in positions:
            target = positions[a]
            if target in positions and positions[target] == a:
                print("YES")
                return
    
        print("NO")

    t = int(input())
    find_spitting_zebras(t)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of using data structures like dictionaries for efficient lookups and the value of clearly defining the problem's requirements before diving into coding.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine the position of a mirror on the x-axis so that Kabir can see Tara's smile, given their coordinates. The solution involved using a geometric approach to calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror based on the coordinates of Kabir and Tara.

The formula derived for the x-coordinate of the mirror is:
\[
x_{mirror} = \frac{x1 + x2}{2} - \frac{(y1 - y2) \cdot (x1 - x2)}{2 \cdot (y1 + y2)}
\]
This formula effectively accounts for the angles of view from both Kabir and Tara, ensuring that the mirror's position allows for a clear line of sight.

The implementation involved reading multiple test cases, processing the coordinates, and applying the formula to compute the mirror's position. The output was formatted to two decimal places to meet the precision requirement.

The code was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach and formula were correct. No unexpected errors occurred during the implementation, and the solution was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the input constraints. 

Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of understanding geometric relationships in problems involving reflections and visibility.

3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to determine the position on the x-axis (the front wall) where a mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's smile. Given the coordinates of Kabir and Tara, we need to calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the position of the mirror, we can use the concept of reflection. The mirror's position on the x-axis can be calculated using the formula derived from the geometry of the situation. The y-coordinate of the mirror will be zero since it lies on the x-axis. The x-coordinate of the mirror can be found using the formula:
   \[
   x_{mirror} = \frac{x1 + x2}{2} - \frac{(y1 - y2) \cdot (x1 - x2)}{2 \cdot (y1 + y2)}
   \]
   This formula accounts for the angles of view from both Kabir and Tara.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_mirror_position(T):
       for each testcase from 1 to T:
           read x1, y1
           read x2, y2
           calculate x_mirror using the formula
           print x_mirror
   ```

INFO - [Task id] 903 [generation text] The official solution takes a different approach to solve the problem of finding the mirror's position. It uses the concept of line equations to determine the intersection point on the x-axis where the mirror should be placed. 

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:
1. **Input Handling**: The solution reads the number of test cases and the coordinates of Kabir and Tara in a straightforward manner, storing them in lists for easy access.
2. **Reflection Concept**: Instead of directly calculating the mirror's position using a derived formula, the official solution reflects Tara's y-coordinate across the x-axis by multiplying it by -1. This simplifies the problem to finding the intersection of two lines: one from Kabir to the reflected point of Tara.
3. **Line Equation**: The slope (m) of the line connecting Kabir and the reflected Tara is calculated, and then the y-intercept (c) is derived. The x-coordinate of the mirror is found by solving the line equation for y=0 (the x-axis).
4. **Output Formatting**: The result is printed with a precision of two decimal places using Python's string formatting.

### Comparison with My Approach:
- My approach used a direct formula derived from geometric principles, which was correct but less intuitive than the line equation method.
- The official solution's method is more robust as it directly utilizes the properties of lines and reflections, making it easier to understand and implement.
- The official solution also handles potential exceptions, which adds a layer of robustness to the code.

In summary, while my solution was valid, the official solution's use of line equations and reflection provides a clearer and more effective method for solving the problem. This experience highlights the importance of considering different mathematical approaches to a problem, especially in geometry-related tasks.
