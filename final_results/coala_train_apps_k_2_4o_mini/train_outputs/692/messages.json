He always tries to do crazy things as he thinks. One day he invented a machine and named it as ANGEN. The ANGEN is used to perform range operations. The range operation means performing operations on range values from {L..R}. At any time it performs operations on values in between L to R.\nANGEN can perform following operations\nU I V - Update the value present at I  with value V\nA L R - Find the sum between range L and R\nM L R - Find the maximum number between L and R\nm L R - Find the minimum number between L and R\nS L R - Find second maximum value in between L and R\ns L R - Find second mimimum value in between L and R\nIf it is not possible perform operation ANGEN returns \u201cNA\u201d with out quotes.\nFor Invalid operations ANGEN returns \u201c!!!\u201d with out quotes.\nNow P29892P challenging his friends and you too, to build his invention with yourown code. So it's your time to defeat P29892P by implementing his invention with your own ability. Let's go and solve the problem.\n\n-----Input-----\nInput description.\n- The first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the number of integers. \n- The next line contains N space separated integers.\"\n- The next line contains a single integer Q denoting the number of Questions.\n-  The next Q lines contains T Question type , L and R.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint output for each question in separate line.\n\n-----Constraints-----\nShould contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have.

Each query specified a range of indices, and the goal was to return the sum of the values in that range for each query. The problem involved reading multiple test cases, processing a list of integers, and efficiently calculating sums based on given indices.\n\n    The solution involved iterating through each test case, reading the number of bills and queries, and then processing each query by summing the specified range of values. The use of Python's built-in `sum()` function allowed for straightforward calculation of the sums. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints provided.\n\n    The final code snippet effectively handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that results were printed for each query. The approach was successful, and no unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation. The key takeaway was the importance of efficiently managing input and output, especially when dealing with potentially large datasets. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def process_queries(T):\n        for _ in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case\n            N, Q = map(int, input().split())  # Read number of bills and queries\n            bills = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the list of bills\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):  # Iterate over each query\n                X, Y = map(int, input().split())  # Read the query indices\n                # Calculate the sum from index X-1 to Y-1 (inclusive)\n                total_sum = sum(bills[X-1:Y])  \n                print(total_sum)  # Output the result for the query\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    process_queries(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I implemented a solution for a hill jumping competition problem where participants jump from one hill to the next higher hill based on given operations. The problem required handling two types of operations: jumping to higher hills and updating the heights of a range of hills.\n\n    The core concepts involved were:\n    1. **Simulating Jumps**: For the first operation type, I created a function to simulate the jumps from a starting hill, checking for the next higher hill within a distance of 100. This required careful index management to ensure jumps were valid.\n    2. **Updating Heights**: For the second operation type, I implemented a straightforward function to update the heights of hills in a specified range.\n\n    The solution was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints, as it directly manipulated the list of heights and processed each operation in a linear manner. \n\n    The final implementation successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was effective. The key takeaway was the importance of managing indices correctly and ensuring that operations on the list were performed efficiently to meet the problem's constraints. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def jump_to_hill(heights, start_index, jumps):\n        current_index = start_index\n        for jump in range(jumps):\n            next_index = current_index + 1\n            found = False\n            while next_index < len(heights) and next_index <= current_index + 100:\n                if heights[next_index] > heights[current_index]:\n                    current_index = next_index\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                next_index += 1\n            if not found:\n                break\n        return current_index\n\n    def update_heights(heights, L, R, X):\n        for i in range(L-1, R):\n            heights[i] += X\n\n    def process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations):\n        for operation in operations:\n            if operation[0] == 1:\n                i = operation[1] - 1\n                k = operation[2]\n                result = jump_to_hill(heights, i, k)\n                print(result + 1)\n            elif operation[0] == 2:\n                L = operation[1]\n                R = operation[2]\n                X = operation[3]\n                update_heights(heights, L, R, X)\n\n    N, Q = map(int, input().split())\n    heights = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(Q)]\n    process_operations(N, Q, heights, operations)\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of integers and the integers themselves, followed by the number of queries. This is done using standard input functions, which is a common practice in competitive programming.\n\n2. **Query Validation**: The solution maintains a string `VQ` that contains valid operation characters. This allows for quick validation of the query type, ensuring that any invalid operation immediately returns \"!!!\".\n\n3. **Direct Updates**: For the update operation ('U'), the solution directly modifies the list at the specified index, which is efficient and straightforward.\n\n4. **Range Operations**: For sum ('A'), maximum ('M'), and minimum ('m') operations, the solution uses built-in functions (`sum`, `max`, `min`) to compute the results over the specified range. This is efficient given the constraints.\n\n5. **Second Maximum and Minimum**: For the second maximum ('S') and second minimum ('s') operations, the solution sorts the unique values in the specified range. It checks if there are at least two unique values before attempting to access the second one, returning \"NA\" if not.\n\n6. **Efficiency**: The use of built-in functions and the handling of operations in a single pass through the queries makes the solution efficient. The sorting of unique values is the most computationally intensive part, but it is handled well within the constraints.\n\nOverall, the official solution effectively balances clarity and efficiency, making it a strong reference for similar problems involving range queries and updates on lists. The approach of validating operations upfront and using built-in functions for common tasks is particularly noteworthy."

For example, in applications involving data analysis, statistical computations, or real-time data processing where you need to frequently calculate sums, maximums, minimums, and other statistics over subarrays. It can also be applied in competitive programming or algorithm design where handling dynamic data structures is required."
