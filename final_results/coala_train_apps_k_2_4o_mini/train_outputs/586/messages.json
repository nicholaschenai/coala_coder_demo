The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.\n$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. \nThat means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').\nIt is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.\n\n-----Input:-----Input:\n- \nFirst line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- \nThe first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. \n- \nThen $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.\n- \nThen $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.\n\n-----Output:-----Output:\nFor each testcase,print the scoreboard.\nThat means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order\n\n-----Constraints-----Constraints\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10$\n- $1 \\leq R \\leq N \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq ti \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq pi \\leq 10^6$\nSum of points ($pi$) of a team will not cross $10^9$.\n\n-----Sample Input:-----Sample Input:\n1\n10 5\namigoes  1\nbannermen 1\nmonarchy 4\noutliers 5\niniciador 10\naegimos 2\niiiacdnor 1\neilorstu 1\ngimosae 3\nmnachroy 7\n\n-----Sample Output:-----Sample Output:\niniciador 11\nmonarchy 11\namigoes 6\noutliers 6\nbannermen 1\n\n-----Explanation:-----Explanation:\n\n$It$ $is$ $assured$ $that$ $each$ $team$ $will$ $submit$ $once$ $within$ $first$ $half$ $an$ $hour$.That means -                                          \n\nthat kind of submissions isn't possible within first half an hour.\nDataset can be huge.

Each team has a unique name, but the order of characters in the name does not matter (e.g., \"abc\" is the same as \"cba\"). After collecting scores from the teams, he wants to create a scoreboard that lists the teams and their total scores. The scoreboard should be sorted first by score in descending order, and if two teams have the same score, they should be sorted by their names in alphabetical order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - Read the number of test cases.\n   - For each test case, read the number of total submissions and the number of submissions in the first half hour.\n   - Create a dictionary to store the total scores for each team, using a normalized version of the team name (sorted characters of the name) as the key.\n   - For the first half hour submissions, directly add the scores to the corresponding team in the dictionary.\n   - For the remaining submissions, normalize the team names and add the scores to the corresponding team in the dictionary.\n   - Once all scores are collected, sort the teams first by score (in descending order) and then by name (in alphabetical order).\n   - Print the sorted results.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function main():\n       read T\n       for each test case from 1 to T:\n           read N, R\n           create an empty dictionary scores\n           for i from 1 to R:\n               read team_name, points\n               add points to scores[team_name]\n           for i from 1 to (N - R):\n               read scrambled_team_name, points\n               normalized_name = sort(scrambled_team_name)\n               add points to scores[normalized_name]\n           sorted_teams = sort(scores.items(), by score descending, then by name ascending)\n           for team, score in sorted_teams:\n               print team, score\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R\n        index += 1\n        scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores\n        \n        # Read the first R submissions\n        for _ in range(R):\n            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on the last space\n            team_name = line[0]\n            points = int(line[1])\n            scores[team_name] = scores.get(team_name, 0) + points\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Read the remaining N-R submissions\n        for _ in range(N - R):\n            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on the last space\n            scrambled_team_name = line[0]\n            points = int(line[1])\n            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(scrambled_team_name))  # Normalize the team name\n            scores[normalized_name] = scores.get(normalized_name, 0) + points\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Sort teams by score (descending) and then by name (ascending)\n        sorted_teams = sorted(scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n        \n        # Prepare results for this test case\n        for team, score in sorted_teams:\n            results.append(f\"{team} {score}\")\n    \n    # Print all results\n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\n# Call the main function to execute the solution\nmain()\n```"

The key concept was to count how many times the number of contestants who solved a subtask decreases as the score increases. This required sorting the subtasks by score and then comparing the number of contestants.\n\n    The solution involved reading the number of problems and subtasks, processing each problem to pair scores with the number of contestants, and counting the valid indices where the number of contestants decreased. The results were stored as tuples and sorted based on difficulty before outputting the indices.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output requirements. The core strategy involved sorting and counting, which worked effectively given the constraints. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all tests, indicating that the approach was sound. \n\n    Key code snippet:\n    ```python\n    def calculate_difficulty(P, S, problems):\n        difficulties = []\n        for i in range(P):\n            scores = problems[i][0]\n            contestants = problems[i][1]\n            paired = list(zip(scores, contestants))\n            paired.sort()  # Sort by scores\n            count = 0\n            for k in range(1, S):\n                if paired[k-1][1] > paired[k][1]:  # Compare number of contestants\n                    count += 1\n            difficulties.append((count, i + 1))  # Store (count, problem index)\n    \n        difficulties.sort()  # Sort by (count, index)\n        for difficulty in difficulties:\n            print(difficulty[1])  # Output the problem index\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of sorting and counting in algorithmic problem-solving, especially in competitive programming contexts.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve. The challenge involved efficiently updating scores for potentially large numbers of students and questions.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate an array based on given ranges and perform arithmetic operations efficiently. The solution involved initializing an array of scores, iterating through the questions, and updating the scores for the specified range of students.

Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:\n\n    1. **Input Handling**: The solution reads the number of problems and subtasks in a single line and initializes a dictionary to store the scores associated with each problem.\n\n    2. **Data Structuring**: For each problem, it reads the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask. It then creates a dictionary (`nsc`) that maps each score to its corresponding number of contestants.

Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve. The challenge involved efficiently updating scores for potentially large numbers of students and questions.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate an array based on given ranges and perform arithmetic operations efficiently. The solution involved initializing an array of scores, iterating through the questions, and updating the scores for the specified range of students. After processing all questions, the mean score was calculated by summing the scores and dividing by the number of students.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that the mean score was printed as an integer. The code was structured to read input in bulk for efficiency, especially given the constraints of up to 100,000 students and questions. \n\n    Key takeaways include the importance of efficient array manipulation and the need to consider performance when dealing with large datasets.

Finally, it prints the indices.\n\n    ### Key Takeaways:\n    - Using a dictionary to group problems by difficulty is an efficient way to manage and sort the results.\n    - Sorting the scores and using a loop to count decreases is straightforward and effective.\n    - The approach of separating the logic into clear steps (input handling, data structuring, counting, grouping, and output) enhances readability and maintainability.\n\n    This solution is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity, especially given the constraints of the problem. It avoids unnecessary complexity by leveraging Python's built-in data structures effectively.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to calculate the mean of maximum scores for students based on the complexity of questions assigned to them. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve. The challenge involved efficiently updating scores for potentially large numbers of students and questions.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate an array based on given ranges and perform arithmetic operations efficiently. The solution involved initializing an array of scores, iterating through the questions, and updating the scores for the specified range of students. After processing all questions, the mean score was calculated by summing the scores and dividing by the number of students.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that the mean score was printed as an integer. The code was structured to read input in bulk for efficiency, especially given the constraints of up to 100,000 students and questions. \n\n    Key takeaways include the importance of efficient array manipulation and the need to consider performance when dealing with large datasets. The solution was straightforward and did not encounter unexpected errors, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem requirements. \n\n    Here is the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, M = case[0]  # Number of students and questions\n            scores = [10] * N  # Initialize scores for all students to 10\n        \n            for question in case[1]:  # Process each question\n                i, j, k = question  # Get the range and complexity\n                for student in range(i - 1, j):  # Update scores for students in range\n                    scores[student] *= k\n        \n            mean_score = sum(scores) // N  # Calculate the mean score\n            print(mean_score)  # Output the mean score\n\n    # Read input\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n\n    T = int(data[0])  # Number of test cases\n    test_cases = []\n    index = 1\n\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, M = map(int, data[index].split())\n        questions = []\n        for j in range(M):\n            i, j, k = map(int, data[index + 1 + j].split())\n            questions.append((i, j, k))\n        test_cases.append(((N, M), questions))\n        index += M + 1\n\n    # Call the function with the parsed input\n    calculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The main challenge was ensuring that the output matched the expected format, which was a list of dictionaries with specific structures. My initial approach focused on using dictionaries to store scores, but I failed to format the output correctly as required by the problem statement.\n\nThe official solution provided a more streamlined approach. It effectively utilized lists to store both the scores and the normalized team names. The key steps in the official solution included:\n1. **Input Handling**: It read all input at once and processed it efficiently.\n2. **Score Calculation**: It maintained a list of scores and team names, updating scores based on normalized names.\n3. **Sorting and Output**: The final results were sorted and printed in the required format, ensuring that the output matched the expected structure.\n\nOne significant difference between my approach and the official solution was the handling of normalized team names. The official solution used a sorted list of characters to compare team names directly, which was more efficient and straightforward than my method of using a dictionary with normalized keys. Additionally, the official solution correctly formatted the output as specified, avoiding the pitfalls I encountered with set and dictionary structures.\n\nOverall, this experience highlighted the importance of closely adhering to output specifications and the value of efficient data structures in solving programming problems."
