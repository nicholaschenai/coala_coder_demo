    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The problem involves a programming competition where teams submit their names and scores. Due to a mistake, the order of the team names has been scrambled, but the characters in the names are the same. We need to tally the scores for each team based on their submissions, ensuring that teams with the same score are sorted alphabetically. The output should display the teams and their total scores in descending order of scores.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   - Read the number of test cases.\n   - For each test case, read the number of submissions and the number of submissions made in the first half hour.\n   - Create a dictionary to store the total scores for each team, using a normalized version of the team name (sorted characters) as the key.\n   - For the first half hour submissions, directly add the scores to the corresponding team.\n   - For the subsequent submissions, normalize the team names and add the scores to the corresponding team in the dictionary.\n   - Once all submissions are processed, sort the teams first by score (in descending order) and then by team name (in lexicographical order).\n   - Print the sorted results.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function process_test_cases():\n       read T\n       for each test case from 1 to T:\n           read N, R\n           initialize an empty dictionary scores\n           for i from 1 to R:\n               read team_name and points\n               add points to scores[team_name]\n           for i from R+1 to N:\n               read scrambled_team_name and points\n               normalized_name = sort(scrambled_team_name)\n               add points to scores[normalized_name]\n           sort scores by (score descending, team_name ascending)\n           print each team_name and score\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef process_test_cases():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())\n        index += 1\n        \n        scores = {}\n        \n        # Process the first R submissions\n        for _ in range(R):\n            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)\n            team_name = line[0]\n            points = int(line[1])\n            if team_name not in scores:\n                scores[team_name] = 0\n            scores[team_name] += points\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Process the remaining N-R submissions\n        for _ in range(N - R):\n            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)\n            scrambled_team_name = line[0]\n            points = int(line[1])\n            # Normalize the team name by sorting its characters\n            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(scrambled_team_name))\n            if normalized_name not in scores:\n                scores[normalized_name] = 0\n            scores[normalized_name] += points\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Prepare the results sorted by score and team name\n        sorted_results = sorted(scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n        \n        for team_name, total_score in sorted_results:\n            results.append(f\"{team_name} {total_score}\")\n    \n    # Print all results at once\n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\n```",
