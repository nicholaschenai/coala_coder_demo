For example, to search for TOM, she can type 866 and for MAX she can type 629.\n+------+-----+------+\n|   1  |  2  |   3  |\n|      | ABC |  DEF |\n+------+-----+------+\n|   4  |  5  |   6  |\n|  GHI | JKL |  MNO |\n+------+-----+------+\n|   7  |  8  |   9  |\n| PQRS | TUV | WXYZ |\n+------+-----+------+\n|      |  0  |      |\n+------+-----+------+\n\nMiu typed a random string of digits $S$ on the keypad while playing around, where each digit is between 2 and 9 inclusive. Now she wants to know the number of possible strings which would map to $S$. \nSince this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007)\n\n-----Input:-----\n- \nThe first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.\n- \nEach test case consists of a string $S$.\n\n-----Output:-----\n- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the count of all possible strings mod 1,000,000,007\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- \n1 <= $T$ <= 10\n- \n1 <= $|S|$ <= 105\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n- 1 <= $|S|$ <= 10\nSubtask #2 (90 points):\n- Original Constraints\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n2\n\n5\n\n72  \n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n3\n\n12  \n\n-----EXPLANATION:-----\n- \nExample Case 1:\n\nOn the key 5, we have the character set JKL.\n\nHence the possible strings are J,K,L.\n\nHence the answer is 3 % (1000000007) = 3.  \n- \nExample Case 2:\nOn key 7, we have the character set PQRS.\n\nOn key 2, we have the character set ABC.\n\nHence the possible strings are PA,PB,PC,QA,QB,QC,RA,RB,RC,SA,SB,SC.\n\nHence the answer is 12 % (1000000007) = 12.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

This can be done by checking every possible starting position in the row and seeing if the substring matches `T`.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n           ```\n           function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n               for each query N:\n                   row_length = N\n                   row_string = construct_row(S, row_length)\n                   count = 0\n                   for i from 0 to row_length - len(T):\n                       if row_string[i:i+len(T)] == T:\n                           count += 1\n                   print count\n\n           function construct_row(S, length):\n               # Create the row by repeating S cyclically\n               row = \"\"\n               while len(row) < length:\n                   row += S\n               return row[:length]\n\n           function main():\n               read S\n               read T\n               read Q\n               for each query:\n                   read N\n                   count_occurrences(S, T, N)\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n        ```python\n        def construct_row(S, length):\n            # Create the row by repeating S cyclically until we reach the desired length\n            row = \"\"\n            while len(row) < length:\n                row += S\n            return row[:length]  # Return only the first 'length' characters\n\n        def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n            results = []\n            for N in queries:\n                row_length = N\n                row_string = construct_row(S, row_length)  # Construct the N-th row\n                count = 0\n                # Count occurrences of T in the row_string\n                for i in range(row_length - len(T) + 1):\n                    if row_string[i:i + len(T)] == T:\n                        count += 1\n                results.append(count)  # Store the result for this query\n            return results\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().splitlines()\n    \n            S = data[0]  # Read string S\n            T = data[1]  # Read string T\n            Q = int(data[2])  # Read number of queries\n            queries = [int(data[i]) for i in range(3, 3 + Q)]  # Read all queries\n    \n            results = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)  # Get results for all queries\n            for result in results:\n                print(result)  # Print each result on a new line\n\n        # Call the main function to execute the program\n        main()\n        ```\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['codechef', 'chefcode', '3', '4', '12', '1455'] Output: 0\n        1\n        181\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"

        "content": "In this task, I was required to calculate the number of possible letter combinations that can be formed from a string of digits typed on a smartphone keypad. Each digit corresponds to a specific set of letters, and the challenge was to efficiently compute the total combinations for potentially large input sizes, while ensuring the result is given modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThe core concept involved mapping each digit (from 2 to 9) to the number of letters it represents. The solution involved iterating through each digit in the input string, multiplying the counts of corresponding letters, and taking the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to handle large numbers.\n\nThe implemented solution was straightforward and effective, utilizing a dictionary for quick lookups of letter counts per digit. The final code successfully handled multiple test cases and produced the correct outputs as verified by the provided test cases.\n\nKey code snippet:\n```python\ndef count_combinations(S):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    digit_to_count = {\n        '2': 3,\n        '3': 3,\n        '4': 3,\n        '5': 3,\n        '6': 3,\n        '7': 4,\n        '8': 3,\n        '9': 4\n    }\n    \n    total_combinations = 1\n    for digit in S:\n        total_combinations = (total_combinations * digit_to_count[digit]) % MOD\n    \n    return total_combinations\n```\n\nOverall, the experience reinforced the importance of efficient data handling and modular arithmetic in programming challenges involving combinatorial calculations."

        "content": "The official solution effectively addresses the problem by iterating through each digit of the input number and calculating the number of possible letter combinations based on the digit's mapping on a phone keypad. Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Digit Mapping**: The solution uses a straightforward mapping for each digit:\n   - Digits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 correspond to 3 letters each.\n   - Digits 7 and 9 correspond to 4 letters each.\n   - Digit 1 corresponds to 1 letter (though it is not used in the context of this problem).\n   - Digit 0 is ignored as it does not correspond to any letters.\n\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: The solution processes each digit by:\n   - Extracting the last digit using modulo operation.\n   - Determining the number of letters corresponding to that digit.\n   - Multiplying the current answer by the number of letters and taking modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to prevent overflow.\n\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution checks if the answer remains 1 after processing all digits, which indicates that no valid combinations were found (e.g., if the input was only zeros). In such cases, it outputs \"0\".\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The solution operates in linear time relative to the number of digits, which is efficient given the constraints.\n\n5. **Code Structure**: The official solution uses a while loop to process the number digit by digit, which is a compact and effective way to handle the input without converting it to a string.\n\nOverall, the official solution is efficient and correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem, while my initial approach was also correct but could have been optimized in terms of handling the input and output more succinctly. The key takeaway is the importance of directly manipulating the number rather than converting it to a string, which can save time and space in certain scenarios."
