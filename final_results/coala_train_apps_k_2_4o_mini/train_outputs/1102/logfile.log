## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
On Miu's smart phone, there is a search feature which lets her search for a contact name by typing digits on the keypad where each digit may correspond to any of the characters given below it. For example, to search for TOM, she can type 866 and for MAX she can type 629.

+------+-----+------+

Miu typed a random string of digits $S$ on the keypad while playing around, where each digit is between 2 and 9 inclusive. Now she wants to know the number of possible strings which would map to $S$. 
Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007)

-----Input:-----
- 
The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
- 
Each test case consists of a string $S$.

-----Output:-----
- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the count of all possible strings mod 1,000,000,007

-----Constraints-----
- 
1 <= $T$ <= 10
- 
1 <= $|S|$ <= 105

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (10 points):
- 1 <= $|S|$ <= 10
Subtask #2 (90 points):
- Original Constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
2

5

72  

-----Sample Output:-----
3

12  

-----EXPLANATION:-----
- 
Example Case 1:

On the key 5, we have the character set JKL.

Hence the possible strings are J,K,L.

Hence the answer is 3 % (1000000007) = 3.  
- 
Example Case 2:
On key 7, we have the character set PQRS.

On key 2, we have the character set ABC.

Hence the possible strings are PA,PB,PC,QA,QB,QC,RA,RB,RC,SA,SB,SC.

Hence the answer is 12 % (1000000007) = 12.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Miu has a smartphone keypad where each digit from 2 to 9 corresponds to a set of letters. Given a string of digits, we need to determine how many different combinations of letters can be formed using those digits. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Each digit corresponds to a specific number of letters:
     - 2 -> ABC (3 letters)
     - 3 -> DEF (3 letters)
     - 4 -> GHI (3 letters)
     - 5 -> JKL (3 letters)
     - 6 -> MNO (3 letters)
     - 7 -> PQRS (4 letters)
     - 8 -> TUV (3 letters)
     - 9 -> WXYZ (4 letters)
   - For each digit in the input string, we can find out how many letters it corresponds to.
   - The total number of combinations can be calculated by multiplying the number of letters for each digit together.
   - Since the result can be large, we will take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define a function count_combinations(S):
       Initialize a dictionary mapping digits to their letter counts
       Initialize result to 1
       For each character in S:
           Convert character to integer
           Multiply result by the number of letters corresponding to that digit
           Take result modulo 1000000007
       Return result

   Read integer T from input
   For i from 0 to T-1:
       Read string S from input
       Print count_combinations(S)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def count_combinations(S):
    # Mapping of digits to the number of corresponding letters
    digit_to_count = {
        '2': 3,  # ABC
        '3': 3,  # DEF
        '4': 3,  # GHI

        '8': 3,  # TUV
        '9': 4   # WXYZ
    }
    
    result = 1
    MOD = 1000000007
    
    # Calculate the total combinations
    for char in S:
        result = (result * digit_to_count[char]) % MOD
    
    return result

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    S = input().strip()  # Read the string of digits
    print(count_combinations(S))  # Output the result for each test case

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
On Miu's smart phone, there is a search feature which lets her search for a contact name by typing digits on the keypad where each digit may correspond to any of the characters given below it. For example, to search for TOM, she can type 866 and for MAX she can type 629.

Miu typed a random string of digits $S$ on the keypad while playing around, where each digit is between 2 and 9 inclusive. Now she wants to know the number of possible strings which would map to $S$. 
Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007)

-----Input:-----

Each test case consists of a string $S$.

-----Output:-----
- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the count of all possible strings mod 1,000,000,007

Example Case 2:
On key 7, we have the character set PQRS.

On key 2, we have the character set ABC.

Hence the possible strings are PA,PB,PC,QA,QB,QC,RA,RB,RC,SA,SB,SC.

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
           We need to find the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} such that a specific number I appears at the K-th position in the sorted order of the subset. We will handle multiple queries for each test case, and the results should be printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
           To solve this problem, we need to understand how to count the valid subsets:
           - For a number I to be at the K-th position in a subset, there must be exactly K-1 numbers that are less than I in the subset.
           - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than I.
           - We can use combinatorial counting to determine how many ways we can choose K-1 numbers from the numbers less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I.
           - The total number of valid subsets can be calculated using combinations and powers of 2.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
           ```
           function count_subsets(N, queries):
               MOD = 10**9 + 7

    [Task]:
        Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
        - N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
        - Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
        - The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
        He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
        You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where i≤j$i \leq j$.
        For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
        c
        co
        cod
        code
        codec
        codeco
        codecod
        codecode
        codecodec
        codecodeco
        ...

        -----Input:-----
        - The first line contains string S$S$ — consisting of lowercase English letters.
        - The second line contains string T$T$ — consisting of lowercase English letters.
        - Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ — the number of queries.
        - Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

        -----Output:-----
        - Print Q$Q$ lines. The i$i$-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row.

        -----Constraints-----
        - 1≤|S|≤105$1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$
        - 1≤|T|≤|S|$1 \leq |T| \leq |S|$
        - 1≤Q≤105$1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$
        - 1≤N≤109$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$

        -----Sample Input:-----
        codechef
        chefcode
        3
        4
        12
        1455

        -----Sample Output:-----
        0
        1
        181

        -----Explanation:-----
        Pyramid will be formed as explained in the statement.
        Query 1: Row number 4 of the pyramid is code. The number of occurrences of chefcode in code is 0.
        Query 2: Row number 12 of the pyramid is codechefcode. The number of occurrences of chefcode in codechefcode is 1.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
           We have a string `S` that is used to create an infinite pyramid of rows, where the N-th row contains N characters formed by repeating the string `S` cyclically. We also have another string `T`, and we need to answer multiple queries about how many times `T` appears as a substring in the N-th row of the pyramid.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
           To solve this problem, we need to:
           - Determine the length of the N-th row, which is simply N.
           - Construct the N-th row by taking the first N characters from the cyclic repetition of `S`.
           - Count the occurrences of the string `T` in this row. This can be done by checking every possible starting position in the row and seeing if the substring matches `T`.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
           ```
           function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
               for each query N:
                   row_length = N
                   row_string = construct_row(S, row_length)
                   count = 0
                   for i from 0 to row_length - len(T):
                       if row_string[i:i+len(T)] == T:
                           count += 1
                   print count

           function construct_row(S, length):
               # Create the row by repeating S cyclically
               row = ""
               while len(row) < length:
                   row += S
               return row[:length]

           function main():
               read S
               read T
               read Q
               for each query:
                   read N
                   count_occurrences(S, T, N)
           ```

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
On Miu's smart phone, there is a search feature which lets her search for a contact name by typing digits on the keypad where each digit may correspond to any of the characters given below it. For example, to search for TOM, she can type 866 and for MAX she can type 629.
+------+-----+------+
|   1  |  2  |   3  |
|      | ABC |  DEF |
+------+-----+------+
|   4  |  5  |   6  |
|  GHI | JKL |  MNO |
+------+-----+------+
|   7  |  8  |   9  |
| PQRS | TUV | WXYZ |
+------+-----+------+
|      |  0  |      |
+------+-----+------+

Miu typed a random string of digits $S$ on the keypad while playing around, where each digit is between 2 and 9 inclusive. Now she wants to know the number of possible strings which would map to $S$. 
Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007)

-----Input:-----
- 
The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
- 
Each test case consists of a string $S$.

-----Output:-----
- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the count of all possible strings mod 1,000,000,007

-----Constraints-----
- 
1 <= $T$ <= 10
- 
1 <= $|S|$ <= 105

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (10 points):
- 1 <= $|S|$ <= 10
Subtask #2 (90 points):
- Original Constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
2

5

72  

-----Sample Output:-----
3

12  

-----EXPLANATION:-----
- 
Example Case 1:

On the key 5, we have the character set JKL.

Hence the possible strings are J,K,L.

Hence the answer is 3 % (1000000007) = 3.  
- 
Example Case 2:
On key 7, we have the character set PQRS.

On key 2, we have the character set ABC.

Hence the possible strings are PA,PB,PC,QA,QB,QC,RA,RB,RC,SA,SB,SC.

Hence the answer is 12 % (1000000007) = 12.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] In this task, I was required to calculate the number of possible letter combinations that can be formed from a string of digits typed on a smartphone keypad. Each digit corresponds to a specific set of letters, and the challenge was to efficiently compute the total combinations for potentially large input sizes, while ensuring the result is given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The core concept involved mapping each digit (from 2 to 9) to the number of letters it represents. The solution involved iterating through each digit in the input string, multiplying the counts of corresponding letters, and taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

The implemented solution was straightforward and effective, utilizing a dictionary for quick lookups of letter counts per digit. The final code successfully handled multiple test cases and produced the correct outputs as verified by the provided test cases.

Key code snippet:
```python
def count_combinations(S):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    digit_to_count = {
        '2': 3,
        '3': 3,
        '4': 3,
        '5': 3,
        '6': 3,
        '7': 4,
        '8': 3,
        '9': 4
    }
    
    total_combinations = 1
    for digit in S:
        total_combinations = (total_combinations * digit_to_count[digit]) % MOD
    
    return total_combinations
```

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of efficient data handling and modular arithmetic in programming challenges involving combinatorial calculations.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
On Miu's smart phone, there is a search feature which lets her search for a contact name by typing digits on the keypad where each digit may correspond to any of the characters given below it. For example, to search for TOM, she can type 866 and for MAX she can type 629.
+------+-----+------+
|   1  |  2  |   3  |
|      | ABC |  DEF |
+------+-----+------+
|   4  |  5  |   6  |
|  GHI | JKL |  MNO |
+------+-----+------+
|   7  |  8  |   9  |
| PQRS | TUV | WXYZ |
+------+-----+------+
|      |  0  |      |
+------+-----+------+

Miu typed a random string of digits $S$ on the keypad while playing around, where each digit is between 2 and 9 inclusive. Now she wants to know the number of possible strings which would map to $S$. 
Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007)

-----Input:-----
- 
The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
- 
Each test case consists of a string $S$.

-----Output:-----
- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the count of all possible strings mod 1,000,000,007

-----Constraints-----
- 
1 <= $T$ <= 10
- 
1 <= $|S|$ <= 105

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (10 points):
- 1 <= $|S|$ <= 10
Subtask #2 (90 points):
- Original Constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
2

5

72  

-----Sample Output:-----
3

12  

-----EXPLANATION:-----
- 
Example Case 1:

On the key 5, we have the character set JKL.

Hence the possible strings are J,K,L.

Hence the answer is 3 % (1000000007) = 3.  
- 
Example Case 2:
On key 7, we have the character set PQRS.

On key 2, we have the character set ABC.

Hence the possible strings are PA,PB,PC,QA,QB,QC,RA,RB,RC,SA,SB,SC.

Hence the answer is 12 % (1000000007) = 12.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Miu has a smartphone keypad where each digit corresponds to a set of letters. When she types a string of digits, we need to determine how many possible letter combinations can be formed from those digits. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Each digit from 2 to 9 corresponds to a specific number of letters:
     - 2 -> ABC (3 letters)
     - 3 -> DEF (3 letters)
     - 4 -> GHI (3 letters)
     - 5 -> JKL (3 letters)
     - 6 -> MNO (3 letters)
     - 7 -> PQRS (4 letters)
     - 8 -> TUV (3 letters)
     - 9 -> WXYZ (4 letters)
   - For each digit in the input string, we can find the number of letters it corresponds to and multiply these counts together to get the total number of combinations.
   - Since the result can be large, we will take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_combinations(S):
       MOD = 10**9 + 7
       digit_to_count = {
           '2': 3,

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.

- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem by iterating through each digit of the input number and calculating the number of possible letter combinations based on the digit's mapping on a phone keypad. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Digit Mapping**: The solution uses a straightforward mapping for each digit:
   - Digits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 correspond to 3 letters each.
   - Digits 7 and 9 correspond to 4 letters each.
   - Digit 1 corresponds to 1 letter (though it is not used in the context of this problem).
   - Digit 0 is ignored as it does not correspond to any letters.

2. **Iterative Calculation**: The solution processes each digit by:
   - Extracting the last digit using modulo operation.
   - Determining the number of letters corresponding to that digit.
   - Multiplying the current answer by the number of letters and taking modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution checks if the answer remains 1 after processing all digits, which indicates that no valid combinations were found (e.g., if the input was only zeros). In such cases, it outputs "0".

4. **Efficiency**: The solution operates in linear time relative to the number of digits, which is efficient given the constraints.

5. **Code Structure**: The official solution uses a while loop to process the number digit by digit, which is a compact and effective way to handle the input without converting it to a string.

Overall, the official solution is efficient and correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem, while my initial approach was also correct but could have been optimized in terms of handling the input and output more succinctly. The key takeaway is the importance of directly manipulating the number rather than converting it to a string, which can save time and space in certain scenarios.
