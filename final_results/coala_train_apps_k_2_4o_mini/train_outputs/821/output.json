    "raw_msg": "Given the previous analysis and the need to correctly maximize the green area by properly coloring the intervals, I will revise the solution. The key is to ensure that we handle overlaps correctly and alternate colors appropriately.\n\n### Key Insights for the Solution:\n1. **Overlap Handling:** We need to ensure that when we encounter overlapping intervals, we alternate colors to maximize the green area.\n2. **Sorting:** Sorting the intervals by their starting points will help us efficiently check for overlaps.\n3. **Color Assignment:** We should maintain a list of colors assigned to each interval and ensure that overlapping intervals are colored differently.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n- Sort the intervals based on their starting points.\n- Use a list to keep track of the colors assigned to each interval.\n- For each interval, check against all previously processed intervals to determine if it overlaps and assign colors accordingly.\n\nHere\u2019s the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    \n    for intervals in test_cases:\n        n = intervals[0]\n        interval_list = intervals[1]\n        \n        # Sort intervals based on their starting point\n        indexed_intervals = sorted((L, R, i) for i, (L, R) in enumerate(interval_list))\n        \n        result = ['0'] * n  # Initialize all intervals as blue (0)\n        \n        # We will keep track of the last colored interval\n        active_intervals = []\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            L, R, index = indexed_intervals[i]\n            overlap_found = False\n            \n            # Check for overlaps with active intervals\n            for j in range(len(active_intervals)):\n                active_L, active_R, active_index = active_intervals[j]\n                if R > active_L:  # There is an overlap\n                    overlap_found = True\n                    # Alternate colors\n                    if result[active_index] == '0':\n                        result[index] = '1'  # Color current interval yellow\n                    else:\n                        result[index] = '0'  # Color current interval blue\n                    break\n            \n            if not overlap_found:\n                # No overlap, keep it blue\n                result[index] = '0'\n            \n            # Add the current interval to the active list\n            active_intervals.append((L, R, index))\n        \n        # Join the result list to form the output string\n        results.append(''.join(result))\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n# Read input\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    n = int(input())\n    intervals = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]\n    test_cases.append((n, intervals))\n\nmaximize_green_intervals(test_cases)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Input Handling:** The code reads the number of test cases and the intervals for each test case.\n2. **Sorting:** The intervals are sorted based on their starting points to facilitate overlap checking.\n3. **Coloring Logic:** \n   - Each interval is initialized to blue (0).\n   - For each interval, we check against all previously processed intervals to see if there is an overlap.\n   - If an overlap is found, we alternate the colors to maximize the green area.\n   - If no overlap is found, the interval remains blue.\n4. **Output:** Finally, the results are printed for each test case.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly maximize the green area by considering all overlaps and alternating colors appropriately.",
