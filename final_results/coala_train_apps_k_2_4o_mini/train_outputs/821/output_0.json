    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The task is to color a set of intervals on the X-axis either blue or yellow in such a way that the total length of the area that is colored green (where both blue and yellow intervals overlap) is maximized. Each interval can only be colored one of the two colors, and we need to output the color for each interval in a specific format.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To maximize the green area, we should look for overlaps between intervals. If two intervals overlap, we can color one blue and the other yellow to create a green area. We can iterate through the intervals, checking for overlaps and deciding on the color based on the overlaps. If an interval does not overlap with any others, we can color it either blue or yellow without affecting the green area. The output should be a string where '0' represents blue and '1' represents yellow.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read number of intervals n\n           create a list of intervals\n           create a result list initialized to empty\n           \n           sort intervals based on their starting point\n           \n           for i from 0 to n-1:\n               if current interval overlaps with previous:\n                   color current interval yellow (1) if previous is blue (0), else color it blue (0)\n               else:\n                   color current interval blue (0) by default\n           \n           convert result list to string and store it\n       \n       return all results as output\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    \n    for intervals in test_cases:\n        n = intervals[0]\n        interval_list = intervals[1]\n        \n        # Sort intervals based on their starting point\n        interval_list.sort()\n        \n        result = []\n        last_color = None\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            L, R = interval_list[i]\n            if i > 0:\n                # Check if the current interval overlaps with the previous one\n                prev_L, prev_R = interval_list[i - 1]\n                if R > prev_L:  # There is an overlap\n                    # Alternate colors to maximize green area\n                    if last_color == '0':\n                        result.append('1')  # Color current interval yellow\n                        last_color = '1'\n                    else:\n                        result.append('0')  # Color current interval blue\n                        last_color = '0'\n                else:\n                    # No overlap, color it blue by default\n                    result.append('0')\n                    last_color = '0'\n            else:\n                # First interval, color it blue by default\n                result.append('0')\n                last_color = '0'\n        \n        # Join the result list to form the output string\n        results.append(''.join(result))\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n# Read input\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    n = int(input())\n    intervals = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]\n    test_cases.append((n, intervals))\n\nmaximize_green_intervals(test_cases)\n```",
