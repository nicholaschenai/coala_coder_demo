    "summary": "### Summary of Attempts\n\nThe problem involved coloring intervals on the X-axis to maximize the length of the green area, which occurs when blue and yellow intervals overlap. The main challenge was to ensure that overlapping intervals were colored differently to create green areas.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- **Overlap Detection:** The solution required checking for overlaps between intervals to determine how to color them.\n- **Color Alternation:** When overlaps were detected, the intervals needed to be colored alternately to maximize the green area.\n\n**Initial Strategies:**\n- The initial approach involved sorting the intervals and checking for overlaps with only the last colored interval. This led to incorrect results, as it did not account for multiple overlapping intervals effectively.\n\n**Errors and Fixes:**\n- The main error was in the overlap handling logic, which did not properly alternate colors for all overlapping intervals. The output for the test case `['1', '3', '3 7', '2 5', '6 9']` was expected to be `100`, but the implementation returned `101`.\n- The solution needed to maintain a list of active intervals and check against all of them for overlaps, ensuring that colors were assigned correctly.\n\n**Final Code Snippet:**\n```python\ndef maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    \n    for intervals in test_cases:\n        n = intervals[0]\n        interval_list = intervals[1]\n        \n        indexed_intervals = sorted((L, R, i) for i, (L, R) in enumerate(interval_list))\n        \n        result = ['0'] * n  # Initialize all intervals as blue (0)\n        \n        active_intervals = []\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            L, R, index = indexed_intervals[i]\n            overlap_found = False\n            \n            for j in range(len(active_intervals)):\n                active_L, active_R, active_index = active_intervals[j]\n                if R > active_L:  # There is an overlap\n                    overlap_found = True\n                    if result[active_index] == '0':\n                        result[index] = '1'  # Color current interval yellow\n                    else:\n                        result[index] = '0'  # Color current interval blue\n                    break\n            \n            if not overlap_found:\n                result[index] = '0'\n            \n            active_intervals.append((L, R, index))\n        \n        results.append(''.join(result))\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n```\n\nThis summary encapsulates the core concepts, strategies, and errors encountered during the problem-solving process, providing a reference for future similar problems.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\nIn my attempts to solve the problem of maximizing the green area on the X-axis by coloring intervals, I encountered several challenges that ultimately led to incorrect outputs. The primary issue was in the handling of overlapping intervals and the logic used to alternate colors. My approach focused on checking overlaps with only the last colored interval, which was insufficient for correctly determining the optimal coloring strategy.\n\nThe official solution, however, provides a more effective approach. It utilizes a systematic method to track the left and right endpoints of the intervals, sorting them first to facilitate easier overlap detection. The key steps in the official solution are as follows:\n\n1. **Input Handling:** The solution reads the number of intervals and their respective endpoints.\n2. **Sorting:** It sorts the intervals based on their starting points, which allows for a straightforward comparison of overlaps.\n3. **Color Assignment Logic:** \n   - It maintains a variable `maxi` to track the maximum right endpoint encountered so far.\n   - It uses a counter `c` to alternate colors (0 or 1) based on the conditions of overlap:\n     - If the current interval starts after the last maximum right endpoint, it is assigned the current color.\n     - If it ends before or at the maximum, it is assigned the opposite color.\n     - If it overlaps but extends beyond the current maximum, it updates the maximum and toggles the color.\n\nThis approach is efficient and ensures that all intervals are processed correctly, leading to the desired output. The use of bitwise XOR (`^`) for toggling colors is a clever and concise way to manage color assignments without needing additional conditional checks.\n\nIn summary, the official solution's method of sorting and systematic overlap checking is a more robust approach than my initial attempts. It highlights the importance of considering all overlaps comprehensively and maintaining clear state variables to track the necessary conditions for coloring.",
