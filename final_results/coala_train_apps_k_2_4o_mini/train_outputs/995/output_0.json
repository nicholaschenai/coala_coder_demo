    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   Mr. Krabs wants to maximize the amount of money he can collect from a series of rooms in a bank. He can only unlock a limited number of rooms (k) using keys he has stolen. The rooms are arranged in a line, and he can only access the two end rooms initially. To access any inner room, he must first unlock an adjacent room. The goal is to determine the maximum amount of money he can collect by strategically unlocking rooms.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - Start by considering the two corner rooms as the only accessible rooms.\n   - Use a greedy approach to unlock the rooms that yield the highest amount of money while adhering to the constraint of k keys.\n   - We can simulate unlocking rooms from both ends (left and right) and keep track of the total money collected.\n   - We will maintain a running total of the money collected and the number of keys used, ensuring we do not exceed k.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function max_money(n, A, k):\n       left = 0\n       right = n - 1\n       total_money = 0\n       keys_used = 0\n       \n       while keys_used < k:\n           if left <= right:\n               if A[left] > A[right]:\n                   total_money += A[left]\n                   left += 1\n               else:\n                   total_money += A[right]\n                   right -= 1\n               keys_used += 1\n           else:\n               break\n       \n       return total_money\n\n   read n\n   read A\n   read k\n   result = max_money(n, A, k)\n   print(result)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef max_money(n, A, k):\n    # Initialize pointers for the leftmost and rightmost rooms\n    left = 0\n    right = n - 1\n    total_money = 0  # To keep track of the total money collected\n    keys_used = 0  # To count the number of keys used\n    \n    # While we have keys left to use\n    while keys_used < k:\n        # Check if we can still access rooms\n        if left <= right:\n            # Choose the room with the maximum money available\n            if A[left] > A[right]:\n                total_money += A[left]  # Collect money from the left room\n                left += 1  # Move to the next room on the left\n            else:\n                total_money += A[right]  # Collect money from the right room\n                right -= 1  # Move to the next room on the right\n            keys_used += 1  # Increment the count of keys used\n        else:\n            break  # Exit if no more rooms can be accessed\n    \n    return total_money  # Return the total money collected\n\n# Read input values\nn = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\nk = int(input())\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nresult = max_money(n, A, k)\nprint(result)\n```",
