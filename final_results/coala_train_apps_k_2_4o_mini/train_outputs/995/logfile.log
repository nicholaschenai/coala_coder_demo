## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mr. Krabs loves money. He enters a bank and sees that there are n rooms arranged in a row. The only rooms with doors are the two rooms on either corner. Initially, all the rooms are locked (including the corner ones). To enter a room, it must be unlocked with a key.
Mr. Krabs is able to steal k keys from the sleeping night guard. Each key can be used to unlock only one room. To reach one of the inner rooms, he has to unlock an adjacent room first.
Eg: If there are 5 rooms labelled: 1 2 3 4 5
Only Rooms 1 and 5 can be accessed initially. To unlock room 2, either room 1 or room 3 must be unlocked. Similarly to unlock Room 4, he must unlock room 5 or room 3 first.
Each room has some money in it. The money present in room i is given by A[i]. Using the k keys, calculate what is the maximum possible amount of money obtainable.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain n,  number of rooms.
- Second line will contain space separated integers, denoting A[i], money present in each room.
- Third line will contain an integer, k, the number of keys available.

-----Output:-----
Maximum money obtained.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 10^5
- 1 <= A[i] <= 10^4
- 1 <= k <= Number of Rooms

-----Subtasks-----
- 40 points : 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 100
- 60 points : Number of Rooms > 100

-----Sample Input:-----
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 1
3

-----Sample Output:-----
12

-----Explanation:-----
For the first step, Mr. Krabs can only unlock the room at the left corner or the right corner. If he unlocks the room in the right corner, he obtains 1 dollar. He can then go on to unlock the second last room and gain 6 dollars, for a total of 7 dollars. Finally he can unlock the third last room and get 5 dollars, for a total of 12 dollars. 
This is the maximum amount of money he can get with only 3 keys.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 995 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Mr. Krabs is in a bank with a row of rooms, each containing some money. He can only unlock the first or last room initially, and he has a limited number of keys to unlock additional rooms. The goal is to determine the maximum amount of money he can collect by strategically using the keys to unlock the rooms.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will consider the maximum money that can be collected by unlocking rooms from either end of the row. We will keep track of the total money collected as we unlock rooms, ensuring that we do not exceed the number of keys available. We will explore both directions (from the left and from the right) and calculate the maximum money obtainable by unlocking rooms in a way that maximizes the total amount collected.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_money(n, A, k):
       left_money = 0
       right_money = 0
       
       // Calculate money from the left side
       for i from 0 to min(k, n) - 1:
           left_money += A[i]
       
       // Calculate money from the right side
       for i from 0 to min(k, n) - 1:
           right_money += A[n - 1 - i]
       
       // Find the maximum money obtainable
       max_money = max(left_money, right_money)
       
       // Check combinations of keys used from both sides
       for i from 1 to k - 1:
           if i < n and (k - i) < n:
               current_money = sum of A[0 to i-1] + sum of A[n - 1 to n - (k - i)]
               max_money = max(max_money, current_money)
       
       return max_money
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def max_money(n, A, k):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of money collected from both ends
    left_money = 0
    right_money = 0
    
    # Calculate total money that can be collected from the left side
    for i in range(min(k, n)):
        left_money += A[i]
    
    # Calculate total money that can be collected from the right side
    for i in range(min(k, n)):
        right_money += A[n - 1 - i]
    
    # Start with the maximum money obtainable from either side
    max_money = max(left_money, right_money)
    
    # Check combinations of keys used from both sides
    for i in range(1, k):
        if i < n and (k - i) < n:
            current_money = sum(A[0:i]) + sum(A[n - (k - i):n])

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy given a list of prices and a budget. The core concept involved sorting the prices to prioritize cheaper chocolates, allowing for the purchase of the maximum quantity without exceeding the budget.

    The solution involved the following steps:
    1. Sort the list of chocolate prices in ascending order.
    2. Iterate through the sorted prices, maintaining a running total of the amount spent and the count of chocolates bought.
    3. Stop the iteration when adding another chocolate would exceed the budget.

    The implemented code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was straightforward, leading to a correct solution. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def max_chocolates(n, k, prices):
        prices.sort()
        total_spent = 0
        chocolates_bought = 0
    
        for price in prices:
            if total_spent + price <= k:
                total_spent += price
                chocolates_bought += 1
            else:
                break
    
        return chocolates_bought

    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = max_chocolates(n, k, prices)
    print(result)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of sorting in optimization problems and the effectiveness of a greedy approach in maximizing the number of items purchased within a budget. No unexpected errors were encountered, and the solution passed all tests successfully.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
           Anushka wants to buy as many chocolates as possible with a limited amount of money. Each chocolate has a specific price, and she needs to figure out how many chocolates she can buy without exceeding her budget.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
           - First, we will sort the list of chocolate prices in ascending order. This way, we can start buying the cheapest chocolates first, maximizing the number of chocolates Anushka can buy.
           - Then, we will iterate through the sorted list of prices, keeping track of the total amount spent and the number of chocolates bought. We will stop when adding another chocolate would exceed her budget.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```

               chocolates_bought = 0
       
               for price in prices:
                   if total_spent + price <= k:
                       total_spent += price

INFO - [Task id] 995 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Mr. Krabs wants to maximize the amount of money he can collect from a series of rooms in a bank. He can only unlock a limited number of rooms (k) using keys he has stolen. The rooms are arranged in a line, and he can only access the two end rooms initially. To access any inner room, he must first unlock an adjacent room. The goal is to determine the maximum amount of money he can collect by strategically unlocking rooms.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Start by considering the two corner rooms as the only accessible rooms.

   - We can simulate unlocking rooms from both ends (left and right) and keep track of the total money collected.
   - We will maintain a running total of the money collected and the number of keys used, ensuring we do not exceed k.

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Mr. Krabs wants to maximize the amount of money he can collect from a series of rooms in a bank. He can only unlock a limited number of rooms (k) using keys he has stolen. The rooms are arranged in a line, and he can only access the two end rooms initially. To access any inner room, he must first unlock an adjacent room. The goal is to determine the maximum amount of money he can collect by strategically unlocking rooms.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Start by considering the two corner rooms as the only accessible rooms.
   - Use a greedy approach to unlock the rooms that yield the highest amount of money while adhering to the constraint of k keys.
   - We can simulate unlocking rooms from both ends (left and right) and keep track of the total money collected.
   - We will maintain a running total of the money collected and the number of keys used, ensuring we do not exceed k.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function max_money(n, A, k):
       left = 0
       right = n - 1
       total_money = 0
       keys_used = 0

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mr. Krabs loves money. He enters a bank and sees that there are n rooms arranged in a row. The only rooms with doors are the two rooms on either corner. Initially, all the rooms are locked (including the corner ones). To enter a room, it must be unlocked with a key.
Mr. Krabs is able to steal k keys from the sleeping night guard. Each key can be used to unlock only one room. To reach one of the inner rooms, he has to unlock an adjacent room first.
Eg: If there are 5 rooms labelled: 1 2 3 4 5
Only Rooms 1 and 5 can be accessed initially. To unlock room 2, either room 1 or room 3 must be unlocked. Similarly to unlock Room 4, he must unlock room 5 or room 3 first.
Each room has some money in it. The money present in room i is given by A[i]. Using the k keys, calculate what is the maximum possible amount of money obtainable.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain n,  number of rooms.
- Second line will contain space separated integers, denoting A[i], money present in each room.
- Third line will contain an integer, k, the number of keys available.

-----Output:-----
Maximum money obtained.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 10^5
- 1 <= A[i] <= 10^4
- 1 <= k <= Number of Rooms

-----Subtasks-----
- 40 points : 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 100
- 60 points : Number of Rooms > 100

-----Sample Input:-----
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 1
3

-----Sample Output:-----
12

-----Explanation:-----
For the first step, Mr. Krabs can only unlock the room at the left corner or the right corner. If he unlocks the room in the right corner, he obtains 1 dollar. He can then go on to unlock the second last room and gain 6 dollars, for a total of 7 dollars. Finally he can unlock the third last room and get 5 dollars, for a total of 12 dollars. 
This is the maximum amount of money he can get with only 3 keys.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 995 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to maximize the amount of money Mr. Krabs could collect from a series of rooms using a limited number of keys. The key concepts involved understanding the constraints of unlocking adjacent rooms and the greedy strategy of always choosing the room with the highest money value available.

The solution involved using two pointers to represent the leftmost and rightmost rooms, allowing Mr. Krabs to choose which room to unlock based on the maximum money available. The algorithm iteratively unlocked rooms until the number of keys used reached the limit (k). This approach effectively utilized the greedy method to ensure maximum money collection.

The final implementation was straightforward and passed the provided test case successfully. The code efficiently handled the constraints, ensuring that it could work for the upper limits of the input size. The key takeaway is the importance of greedy algorithms in optimization problems where local choices lead to a global optimum. 

Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

```python
def max_money(n, A, k):
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    total_money = 0
    keys_used = 0
    
    while keys_used < k:
        if left <= right:
            if A[left] > A[right]:
                total_money += A[left]
                left += 1
            else:
                total_money += A[right]
                right -= 1
            keys_used += 1
        else:
            break
    
    return total_money

n = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))
k = int(input())
result = max_money(n, A, k)
print(result)
``` 

This experience reinforced the effectiveness of greedy algorithms in solving optimization problems and highlighted the importance of carefully managing constraints in algorithm design.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution

money=list(map(int,input().split()))
keys=int(input())
rev=-1
a,b=0,-1
tot=[]
#print(money[-3:-1])
x=0

    x=sum(money[b:])+sum(money[0:keys-abs(b)])
    tot.append(x)
    b-=1
print(max(tot))


INFO - [Task id] 995 [generation text] The official solution takes a different approach by leveraging the concept of cumulative sums from both ends of the list of rooms. It calculates the total money that can be collected by unlocking rooms from the left and right sides, iterating through the number of keys available. 

Key insights from the official solution:
1. **Cumulative Sums**: Instead of checking each room individually, the solution computes the total money that can be collected by unlocking a certain number of rooms from both ends. This allows for a more efficient calculation of potential earnings.
2. **Iterative Calculation**: The solution iterates through the number of keys, adjusting the range of rooms considered from both ends. It uses a variable `b` to track how many rooms are being considered from the right side, while `a` implicitly tracks the left side.
3. **Maximization**: By storing the total money collected for each possible combination of keys used, the solution can easily determine the maximum amount of money that can be obtained.

In contrast, my initial approach involved a greedy selection of rooms based on immediate maximum values, which could lead to suboptimal choices as it did not consider the cumulative potential of unlocking multiple rooms. The official solution's method is more systematic and efficient, especially for larger inputs, as it avoids unnecessary checks and directly computes the maximum possible earnings. 

Overall, the official solution is more effective in terms of both time complexity and clarity, demonstrating the importance of considering cumulative effects in problems involving selections from a list.

It calculates the total money that can be collected by unlocking rooms from the left and right sides, iterating through the number of keys available.

The main function is `max_money`.
INFO - [Task id] 995 [generation text] This function calculates the maximum amount of money that can be collected from a series of rooms, given a limited number of keys. It uses two pointers to represent the leftmost and rightmost rooms, and iteratively selects the room with the higher amount of money until the keys run out or all rooms are accessed. The total money collected is updated accordingly, and the function returns this total after all possible collections are made. The approach ensures that the most profitable rooms are prioritized based on their monetary value. The function handles edge cases where no more rooms can be accessed or when all keys have been used. Overall, it efficiently maximizes the money collected within the constraints provided.

[Problem]
    Mr. Krabs loves money. He enters a bank and sees that there are n rooms arranged in a row. The only rooms with doors are the two rooms on either corner. Initially, all the rooms are locked (including the corner ones). To enter a room, it must be unlocked with a key.
    Mr. Krabs is able to steal k keys from the sleeping night guard. Each key can be used to unlock only one room. To reach one of the inner rooms, he has to unlock an adjacent room first.
    Eg: If there are 5 rooms labelled: 1 2 3 4 5
    Only Rooms 1 and 5 can be accessed initially. To unlock room 2, either room 1 or room 3 must be unlocked. Similarly to unlock Room 4, he must unlock room 5 or room 3 first.
    Each room has some money in it. The money present in room i is given by A[i]. Using the k keys, calculate what is the maximum possible amount of money obtainable.

    -----Input:-----
    - First line will contain n,  number of rooms.
    - Second line will contain space separated integers, denoting A[i], money present in each room.
    - Third line will contain an integer, k, the number of keys available.

    -----Output:-----
    Maximum money obtained.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 10^5
    - 1 <= A[i] <= 10^4
    - 1 <= k <= Number of Rooms

    -----Subtasks-----
    - 40 points : 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 100
    - 60 points : Number of Rooms > 100

    -----Sample Input:-----
    7
    1 2 3 4 5 6 1
    3

    -----Sample Output:-----
    12

    -----Explanation:-----
    For the first step, Mr. Krabs can only unlock the room at the left corner or the right corner. If he unlocks the room in the right corner, he obtains 1 dollar. He can then go on to unlock the second last room and gain 6 dollars, for a total of 7 dollars. Finally he can unlock the third last room and get 5 dollars, for a total of 12 dollars. 
    This is the maximum amount of money he can get with only 3 keys.

    def max_money(n, A, k):
        # Initialize pointers for the leftmost and rightmost rooms
        left = 0
        right = n - 1
        total_money = 0  # To keep track of the total money collected
        keys_used = 0  # To count the number of keys used
    
        # While we have keys left to use
        while keys_used < k:
            # Check if we can still access rooms
            if left <= right:
                # Choose the room with the maximum money available
                if A[left] > A[right]:
                    total_money += A[left]  # Collect money from the left room
                    left += 1  # Move to the next room on the left
                else:
                    total_money += A[right]  # Collect money from the right room
                    right -= 1  # Move to the next room on the right
                keys_used += 1  # Increment the count of keys used
            else:
                break  # Exit if no more rooms can be accessed
    
        return total_money  # Return the total money collected

    # Read input values
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k = int(input())

    # Call the function and print the result
    result = max_money(n, A, k)
    print(result)
