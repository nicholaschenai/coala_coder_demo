## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given an array ofÂ integers arr and an integer d. In one step you can jump from index i to index:

i + x where:Â i + x < arr.length and  0 <Â x <= d.
i - x where:Â i - x >= 0 and  0 <Â x <= d.

In addition, you can only jump from index i to index jÂ if arr[i] > arr[j] and arr[i] > arr[k] for all indices k between i and j (More formally min(i,Â j) < k < max(i, j)).
You can choose any index of the array and start jumping. Return the maximum number of indicesÂ you can visit.
Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.
Â 
Example 1:

Input: arr = [6,4,14,6,8,13,9,7,10,6,12], d = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: You can start at index 10. You can jump 10 --> 8 --> 6 --> 7 as shown.
Note that if you start at index 6 you can only jump to index 7. You cannot jump to index 5 because 13 > 9. You cannot jump to index 4 because index 5 is between index 4 and 6 and 13 > 9.
Similarly You cannot jump from index 3 to index 2 or index 1.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [3,3,3,3,3], d = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: You can start at any index. You always cannot jump to any index.

Example 3:
Input: arr = [7,6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 1
Output: 7
Explanation: Start at index 0. You can visit all the indicies. 

Example 4:
Input: arr = [7,1,7,1,7,1], d = 2
Output: 2

Example 5:
Input: arr = [66], d = 1
Output: 1

INFO - [Task id] 155 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have an array of integers and a number `d`. From any index in the array, we can jump to other indices within a distance of `d`, but we can only jump to an index if the value at the starting index is greater than the value at the target index and also greater than all values in between. The goal is to find the maximum number of unique indices we can visit starting from any index in the array.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. For each index in the array, we will explore all possible jumps to the left and right within the distance `d`. We will keep track of the indices we have visited to avoid revisiting them. We will also check the conditions for jumping (the value at the current index must be greater than the target index and all values in between). We will calculate the maximum number of indices we can visit starting from each index and return the highest count.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function maxJumps(arr, d):
       define a helper function dfs(index, visited):
           mark index as visited
           count = 1  // count the current index
           // explore left jumps
           for x from 1 to d:
               if index - x >= 0:
                   if arr[index] > arr[index - x] and all values between index and index - x are less than arr[index]:
                       count += dfs(index - x, visited)
           // explore right jumps
           for x from 1 to d:
               if index + x < length of arr:
                   if arr[index] > arr[index + x] and all values between index and index + x are less than arr[index]:
                       count += dfs(index + x, visited)
           return count

       max_count = 0
       for each index in arr:
           visited = empty set
           max_count = max(max_count, dfs(index, visited))
       return max_count

    ### Restoring the subsequence

    It is also possible to restore the subsequence using this approach.
    This time we have to maintain two auxiliary arrays.
    One that tells us the index of the elements in $d[]$.
    And again we have to create an array of "ancestors" $p[i]$.
    $p[i]$ will be the index of the previous element for the optimal subsequence ending in element $i$.

    It's easy to maintain these two arrays in the course of iteration over the array $a[]$ alongside the computations of $d[]$.
    And at the end it is not difficult to restore the desired subsequence using these arrays.

    ## Solution in $O(n \log n)$ with data structures {data-toc-label="Solution in O(n log n) with data structures"}

    Instead of the above method for computing the longest increasing subsequence in $O(n \log n)$ we can also solve the problem in a different way: using some simple data structures.

    Let's go back to the first method.
    Remember that $d[i]$ is the value $d[j] + 1$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.

    Thus if we define an additional array $t[]$ such that

    $$t[a[i]] = d[i],$$

    then the problem of computing the value $d[i]$ is equivalent to finding the **maximum value in a prefix** of the array $t[]$:

    $$d[i] = \max\left(t[0 \dots a[i] - 1] + 1\right)$$

    The problem of finding the maximum of a prefix of an array (which changes) is a standard problem that can be solved by many different data structures. 
    For instance we can use a [Segment tree](../data_structures/segment_tree.md) or a [Fenwick tree](../data_structures/fenwick.md).

    This method has obviously some **shortcomings**:
    in terms of length and complexity of the implementation this approach will be worse than the method using binary search.
    In addition if the input numbers $a[i]$ are especially large, then we would have to use some tricks, like compressing the numbers (i.e. renumber them from $0$ to $n-1$), or use a dynamic segment tree (only generate the branches of the tree that are important).
    Otherwise the memory consumption will be too high.

    On the other hand this method has also some **advantages**:
    with this method you don't have to think about any tricky properties in the dynamic programming solution.
    And this approach allows us to generalize the problem very easily (see below).

    ## Related tasks

    Here are several problems that are closely related to the problem of finding the longest increasing subsequence.

    ### Longest non-decreasing subsequence

    This is in fact nearly the same problem.
    Only now it is allowed to use identical numbers in the subsequence.

    The solution is essentially also nearly the same.
    We just have to change the inequality signs, and make a slightly modification to the binary search.

    ### Number of longest increasing subsequences

    We can use the first discussed method, either the $O(n^2)$ version or the version using data structures.
    We only have to additionally store in how many ways we can obtain longest increasing subsequences ending in the values $d[i]$.

    The number of ways to form a longest increasing subsequences ending in $a[i]$ is the sum of all ways for all longest increasing subsequences ending in $j$ where $d[j]$ is maximal.
    There can be multiple such $j$, so we need to sum all of them.

    Using a Segment tree this approach can also be implemented in $O(n \log n)$.

    It is not possible to use the binary search approach for this task.

    ### Smallest number of non-increasing subsequences covering a sequence

    For a given array with $n$ numbers $a[0 \dots n - 1]$ we have to colorize the numbers in the smallest number of colors, so that each color forms a non-increasing subsequence.

    To solve this, we notice that the minimum number of required colors is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

    **Proof**:
    We need to prove the **duality** of these two problems.

    Let's denote by $x$ the length of the longest increasing subsequence and by $y$ the least number of non-increasing subsequences that form a cover.
    We need to prove that $x = y$.

    It is clear that $y < x$ is not possible, because if we have $x$ strictly increasing elements, than no two can be part of the same non-increasing subsequence.
    Therefore we have $y \ge x$.

    We now show that $y > x$ is not possible by contradiction.
    Suppose that $y > x$.
    Then we consider any optimal set of $y$ non-increasing subsequences.
    We transform this in set in the following way:
    as long as there are two such subsequences such that the first begins before the second subsequence, and the first sequence start with a number greater than or equal to the second, then we unhook this starting number and attach it to the beginning of second.
    After a finite number of steps we have $y$ subsequences, and their starting numbers will form an increasing subsequence of length $y$.
    Since we assumed that $y > x$ we reached a contradiction.

    Thus it follows that $y = x$.

    **Restoring the sequences**:
    The desired partition of the sequence into subsequences can be done greedily.
    I.e. go from left to right and assign the current number or that subsequence ending with the minimal number which is greater than or equal to the current one.

[Reflection]:
    The official solution employs a set-based dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of minimizing the weight of the last remaining rock. The key insights from this solution are as follows:

    1. **Set for Achievable Sums**: Instead of using a boolean array to track achievable sums, the official solution uses a set `dp` to store all possible sums that can be formed with the given rock weights. This allows for more flexibility and avoids the need for a fixed size array.

    2. **Iterative Sum Calculation**: For each rock weight, the solution updates the set `dp` by adding the current stone's weight to each of the sums already in the set. This effectively generates all possible sums that can be formed with the rocks processed so far.

    3. **Final Calculation**: After processing all rocks, the solution calculates the minimum possible weight of the last stone by evaluating the absolute difference between the total weight and twice each sum in the set. This is based on the idea that the remaining weight can be derived from the difference between the total weight and the sum of one of the partitions.

    4. **Efficiency**: The use of a set allows for dynamic growth of achievable sums without the constraints of a fixed array size, making the solution both space-efficient and straightforward.

    In contrast, my initial approach used a boolean array which, while effective, could be less efficient in terms of space and did not leverage the flexibility of a set to dynamically track achievable sums. The official solution's method of directly calculating the minimum weight from the set of sums is also more elegant and concise. Overall, the official solution provides a more optimal and clear approach to the problem.

INFO - [Task id] 155 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of indices we can visit in an array of integers by jumping from one index to another. We can jump a distance of up to `d` indices either to the left or right, but we can only jump to an index if the value at the starting index is greater than the value at the target index and also greater than all values in between.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. Starting from each index, we will explore all possible jumps to the left and right within the allowed distance `d`. For each jump, we will check if the jump is valid (i.e., the value at the starting index is greater than the value at the target index and all values in between). We will keep track of the maximum number of indices visited during these jumps. To avoid recalculating the number of indices visited from the same starting index, we can use memoization.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function maxJumps(arr, d):
       create a memoization array of the same length as arr initialized to -1
       
       function dfs(index):

               if index + x < length of arr:
                   if arr[index] > arr[index + x] and all values between index and index + x are less than arr[index]:
                       max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index + x))

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of indices we can visit in an array of integers by jumping from one index to another. We can jump a distance of up to `d` indices either to the left or right, but we can only jump to an index if the value at the starting index is greater than the value at the target index and also greater than all values in between.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. Starting from each index, we will explore all possible jumps to the left and right within the allowed distance `d`. For each jump, we will check if the jump is valid (i.e., the value at the starting index is greater than the value at the target index and all values in between). We will keep track of the maximum number of indices visited during these jumps. To avoid recalculating the number of indices visited from the same starting index, we can use memoization.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function maxJumps(arr, d):
       create a memoization array of the same length as arr initialized to -1
       
       function dfs(index):
           if memo[index] is not -1:
               return memo[index]

                       max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index + x))

Output: 4
Explanation: You can start at index 10. You can jump 10 --> 8 --> 6 --> 7 as shown.
Note that if you start at index 6 you can only jump to index 7. You cannot jump to index 5 because 13 > 9. You cannot jump to index 4 because index 5 is between index 4 and 6 and 13 > 9.
Similarly You cannot jump from index 3 to index 2 or index 1.

Example 2:
Input: arr = [3,3,3,3,3], d = 3

INFO - [Task id] 155 [generation text] In this task, I was required to implement a solution for a jumping problem in an array, where the goal was to determine the maximum number of indices that can be visited based on specific jumping rules. The core concepts involved understanding the conditions for valid jumps and utilizing depth-first search (DFS) with memoization to optimize the exploration of possible paths.

The implemented solution involved creating a memoization array to store results for each index, which helped avoid redundant calculations. The DFS function checked both left and right jumps within the allowed distance `d`, ensuring that the jump conditions were met (i.e., the starting index value must be greater than the target index value and all values in between). 

The final code successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was effective. Key strategies included using a helper function for recursion and leveraging Python's list comprehensions for checking conditions efficiently. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of memoization in recursive problems to enhance performance.

   To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. Starting from each index, we will explore all possible jumps to the left and right within the allowed distance `d`. For each jump, we will check if the jump is valid (i.e., the value at the starting index is greater than the value at the target index and all values in between). We will keep track of the maximum number of indices visited during these jumps. To avoid recalculating the number of indices visited from the same starting index, we can use memoization.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function maxJumps(arr, d):
       create a memoization array of the same length as arr initialized to -1
       
       function dfs(index):
           if memo[index] is not -1:
               return memo[index]
           
           max_count = 1  // count the current index
           
           // Check jumps to the right
           for x from 1 to d:
               if index + x < length of arr:
                   if arr[index] > arr[index + x] and all values between index and index + x are less than arr[index]:
                       max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index + x))
           
           // Check jumps to the left
           for x from 1 to d:
               if index - x >= 0:
                   if arr[index] > arr[index - x] and all values between index and index - x are less than arr[index]:
                       max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index - x))
           
           memo[index] = max_count
           return max_count
       
       max_jumps = 0
       for i from 0 to length of arr - 1:
           max_jumps = max(max_jumps, dfs(i))
       
       return max_jumps
   ```

    def maxJumps(self, arr: List[int], d: int) -> int:
        dp = [1] * (len(arr) + 1)
        stack = []
        for i, n in enumerate(arr + [1000000]):
            while stack and arr[stack[-1]] < n:
                same_height_idx = [stack.pop()]
                while stack and arr[stack[-1]] == arr[same_height_idx[0]]:
                    same_height_idx.append(stack.pop())
                for j in same_height_idx:
                    # jump to left
                    if i - j <= d:
                        dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
                    # jump to right
                    if stack and j - stack[-1] <= d:
                        dp[stack[-1]] = max(dp[stack[-1]], dp[j] + 1)
            stack.append(i)
        return max(dp[:-1])

INFO - [Task id] 155 [generation text] The official solution employs a more efficient approach using dynamic programming and a stack to keep track of indices, which allows it to handle the problem in a more optimal manner compared to my initial depth-first search (DFS) approach.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Array**: The solution initializes a DP array (`dp`) where each index represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from that index. This allows for efficient updates as we process each index.

2. **Stack for Indices**: The use of a stack helps manage the indices of the array in a way that allows for quick access to the last processed index. This is crucial for efficiently checking the conditions for valid jumps.

3. **Iterating with a Sentinel Value**: By appending a large sentinel value (1000000) to the end of the array, the algorithm simplifies the logic for processing the last elements, ensuring that all indices are considered.

4. **Handling Equal Heights**: The solution effectively manages cases where multiple indices have the same height by grouping them together and checking jump conditions for all of them.

5. **Two-Directional Jumping**: The algorithm checks both left and right jumps in a single pass, updating the DP array based on the conditions specified (i.e., the jump distance must be within `d`).

### Comparison to My Approach:

- My approach used a recursive DFS with memoization, which can lead to deeper recursion and potentially higher time complexity due to repeated calculations for overlapping subproblems.
- The official solution's use of a stack allows it to maintain a linear time complexity, making it more efficient for larger input sizes.
- The handling of equal heights and the two-directional jump checks are more elegantly managed in the official solution, reducing the complexity of the logic.

Overall, the official solution is a more refined and efficient method for solving the problem, leveraging dynamic programming and stack data structures to optimize performance. This experience highlights the importance of considering different algorithmic strategies, especially when dealing with constraints and potential performance bottlenecks.

It uses depth-first search to explore all possible jumps from each index, while storing results in a memoization array to avoid redundant calculations. For each index, it checks both left and right directions for valid jumps, ensuring that all intermediate values are lower than the starting value. The maximum count of jumps from each starting index is tracked, and the overall maximum is returned after evaluating all indices.

[Problem]
    Given an array ofÂ integers arr and an integer d. In one step you can jump from index i to index:

    i + x where:Â i + x < arr.length and  0 <Â x <= d.
    i - x where:Â i - x >= 0 and  0 <Â x <= d.

    In addition, you can only jump from index i to index jÂ if arr[i] > arr[j] and arr[i] > arr[k] for all indices k between i and j (More formally min(i,Â j) < k < max(i, j)).
    You can choose any index of the array and start jumping. Return the maximum number of indicesÂ you can visit.
    Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.
Â 
    Example 1:

    Input: arr = [6,4,14,6,8,13,9,7,10,6,12], d = 2
    Output: 4
    Explanation: You can start at index 10. You can jump 10 --> 8 --> 6 --> 7 as shown.
    Note that if you start at index 6 you can only jump to index 7. You cannot jump to index 5 because 13 > 9. You cannot jump to index 4 because index 5 is between index 4 and 6 and 13 > 9.
    Similarly You cannot jump from index 3 to index 2 or index 1.

    Example 2:
    Input: arr = [3,3,3,3,3], d = 3
    Output: 1
    Explanation: You can start at any index. You always cannot jump to any index.

    Example 3:
    Input: arr = [7,6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 1
    Output: 7
    Explanation: Start at index 0. You can visit all the indicies. 

    Example 4:
    Input: arr = [7,1,7,1,7,1], d = 2
    Output: 2

    Example 5:
    Input: arr = [66], d = 1
    Output: 1
