In one step you can jump from index i to index:\n\ni + x where:\u00a0i + x < arr.length and  0 <\u00a0x <= d.\ni - x where:\u00a0i - x >= 0 and  0 <\u00a0x <= d.\n\nIn addition, you can only jump from index i to index j\u00a0if arr[i] > arr[j] and arr[i] > arr[k] for all indices k between i and j (More formally min(i,\u00a0j) < k < max(i, j)).\nYou can choose any index of the array and start jumping. Return the maximum number of indices\u00a0you can visit.\nNotice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: arr = [6,4,14,6,8,13,9,7,10,6,12], d = 2\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: You can start at index 10. You can jump 10 --> 8 --> 6 --> 7 as shown.\nNote that if you start at index 6 you can only jump to index 7. You cannot jump to index 5 because 13 > 9.

1] + 1\\right)$$\n\n    The problem of finding the maximum of a prefix of an array (which changes) is a standard problem that can be solved by many different data structures. \n    For instance we can use a [Segment tree](../data_structures/segment_tree.md) or a [Fenwick tree](../data_structures/fenwick.md).\n\n    This method has obviously some **shortcomings**:\n    in terms of length and complexity of the implementation this approach will be worse than the method using binary search.\n    In addition if the input numbers $a[i]$ are especially large, then we would have to use some tricks, like compressing the numbers (i.e. renumber them from $0$ to $n-1$), or use a dynamic segment tree (only generate the branches of the tree that are important).\n    Otherwise the memory consumption will be too high.\n\n    On the other hand this method has also some **advantages**:\n    with this method you don't have to think about any tricky properties in the dynamic programming solution.\n    And this approach allows us to generalize the problem very easily (see below).\n\n    ## Related tasks\n\n    Here are several problems that are closely related to the problem of finding the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    ### Longest non-decreasing subsequence\n\n    This is in fact nearly the same problem.\n    Only now it is allowed to use identical numbers in the subsequence.\n\n    The solution is essentially also nearly the same.\n    We just have to change the inequality signs, and make a slightly modification to the binary search.\n\n    ### Number of longest increasing subsequences\n\n    We can use the first discussed method, either the $O(n^2)$ version or the version using data structures.\n    We only have to additionally store in how many ways we can obtain longest increasing subsequences ending in the values $d[i]$.\n\n    The number of ways to form a longest increasing subsequences ending in $a[i]$ is the sum of all ways for all longest increasing subsequences ending in $j$ where $d[j]$ is maximal.\n    There can be multiple such $j$, so we need to sum all of them.\n\n    Using a Segment tree this approach can also be implemented in $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    It is not possible to use the binary search approach for this task.\n\n    ### Smallest number of non-increasing subsequences covering a sequence\n\n    For a given array with $n$ numbers $a[0 \\dots n - 1]$ we have to colorize the numbers in the smallest number of colors, so that each color forms a non-increasing subsequence.\n\n    To solve this, we notice that the minimum number of required colors is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    **Proof**:\n    We need to prove the **duality** of these two problems.\n\n    Let's denote by $x$ the length of the longest increasing subsequence and by $y$ the least number of non-increasing subsequences that form a cover.\n    We need to prove that $x = y$.\n\n    It is clear that $y < x$ is not possible, because if we have $x$ strictly increasing elements, than no two can be part of the same non-increasing subsequence.\n    Therefore we have $y \\ge x$.\n\n    We now show that $y > x$ is not possible by contradiction.\n    Suppose that $y > x$.\n    Then we consider any optimal set of $y$ non-increasing subsequences.\n    We transform this in set in the following way:\n    as long as there are two such subsequences such that the first begins before the second subsequence, and the first sequence start with a number greater than or equal to the second, then we unhook this starting number and attach it to the beginning of second.\n    After a finite number of steps we have $y$ subsequences, and their starting numbers will form an increasing subsequence of length $y$.\n    Since we assumed that $y > x$ we reached a contradiction.\n\n    Thus it follows that $y = x$.\n\n    **Restoring the sequences**:\n    The desired partition of the sequence into subsequences can be done greedily.\n    I.e. go from left to right and assign the current number or that subsequence ending with the minimal number which is greater than or equal to the current one.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution employs a set-based dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of minimizing the weight of the last remaining rock. The key insights from this solution are as follows:\n\n    1. **Set for Achievable Sums**: Instead of using a boolean array to track achievable sums, the official solution uses a set `dp` to store all possible sums that can be formed with the given rock weights. This allows for more flexibility and avoids the need for a fixed size array.\n\n    2. **Iterative Sum Calculation**: For each rock weight, the solution updates the set `dp` by adding the current stone's weight to each of the sums already in the set. This effectively generates all possible sums that can be formed with the rocks processed so far.\n\n    3. **Final Calculation**: After processing all rocks, the solution calculates the minimum possible weight of the last stone by evaluating the absolute difference between the total weight and twice each sum in the set. This is based on the idea that the remaining weight can be derived from the difference between the total weight and the sum of one of the partitions.\n\n    4. **Efficiency**: The use of a set allows for dynamic growth of achievable sums without the constraints of a fixed array size, making the solution both space-efficient and straightforward.\n\n    In contrast, my initial approach used a boolean array which, while effective, could be less efficient in terms of space and did not leverage the flexibility of a set to dynamically track achievable sums. The official solution's method of directly calculating the minimum weight from the set of sums is also more elegant and concise. Overall, the official solution provides a more optimal and clear approach to the problem.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

It uses depth-first search to explore all possible jumps from each index, while storing results in a memoization array to avoid redundant calculations. For each index, it checks both left and right directions for valid jumps, ensuring that all intermediate values are lower than the starting value. The maximum count of jumps from each starting index is tracked, and the overall maximum is returned after evaluating all indices. This approach efficiently determines the optimal path through the array based on the jumping rules. The final result is the highest number of jumps achievable from any starting position in the array.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to analyze or optimize paths in a constrained environment, such as in game development for character movement, in robotics for navigation, or in algorithm design for problems involving dynamic programming and graph traversal. It can also be applied in competitive programming where similar jumping or pathfinding problems are presented, requiring efficient solutions to maximize the number of reachable indices under specific conditions."
