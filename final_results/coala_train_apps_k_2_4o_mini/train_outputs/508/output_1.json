    "raw_msg": "Here is the corrected Python code that addresses the problem of determining how far each person can walk before encountering a blocked point due to roadworks. The logic has been revised to ensure that we correctly check the conditions for each person against the roadworks:\n\n```python\ndef find_distances():\n    # Read the number of roadworks and people\n    N, Q = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    # Initialize a list to store roadworks\n    roadworks = []\n    \n    # Read each roadwork's details\n    for _ in range(N):\n        S, T, X = map(int, input().split())\n        roadworks.append((S, T, X))\n    \n    # Sort roadworks by the blocked point X\n    roadworks.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])\n    \n    # Read each person's start time and calculate distances\n    for _ in range(Q):\n        D = int(input())\n        distance = -1  # Initialize distance as -1 (indicating walking forever)\n        \n        # Check each roadwork to see if it affects the current person\n        for S, T, X in roadworks:\n            if D < T:  # The person starts before the roadwork ends\n                # Calculate the time it takes for the person to reach the blocked point\n                time_to_reach = D + X  # Time when the person reaches X\n                if time_to_reach >= S and time_to_reach < T:\n                    # If the person reaches the blocked point while it is blocked\n                    if distance == -1 or X < distance:\n                        distance = X  # Update the distance to the nearest blocked point\n        \n        # Output the result for the current person\n        print(distance)\n\n# Call the function to execute the solution\nfind_distances()\n```\n\n### Key Changes Made:\n- The condition to check if the person can reach the blocked point while it is still blocked has been clarified.\n- The logic now correctly calculates the time it takes for the person to reach the blocked point and checks if that time falls within the blocked interval.\n- The output is printed directly for each person after evaluating their distance based on the roadworks.\n\nThis code should now correctly handle the input and output as specified in the problem statement.",
