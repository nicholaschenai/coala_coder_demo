    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   We have a street represented as a number line where certain points are blocked by roadworks during specific time intervals. People start walking from the origin (coordinate 0) at different times and walk towards the positive direction. We need to determine how far each person can walk before they encounter a blocked point. If they can walk indefinitely without hitting a blockage, we return -1 for that person.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   - We will first read the number of roadworks and people.\n   - For each roadwork, we will store the blocked points along with their time intervals.\n   - For each person, we will check if they start walking before any roadwork begins and if they reach a blocked point based on their start time and walking speed.\n   - We will keep track of the nearest blocked point they encounter and return the distance they can walk or -1 if they can walk indefinitely.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Read N and Q\n   Initialize a list for roadworks\n   For i from 1 to N:\n       Read S_i, T_i, X_i and store in roadworks\n   Sort roadworks by X_i (blocked point)\n   \n   For each person:\n       Read D_i\n       Initialize distance as -1\n       For each roadwork:\n           If D_i < T_i and D_i + distance >= S_i:\n               If distance is -1 or X_i < distance:\n                   distance = X_i\n       If distance is still -1:\n           Print -1\n       Else:\n           Print distance\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_distances():\n    # Read the number of roadworks and people\n    N, Q = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    # Initialize a list to store roadworks\n    roadworks = []\n    \n    # Read each roadwork's details\n    for _ in range(N):\n        S, T, X = map(int, input().split())\n        roadworks.append((S, T, X))\n    \n    # Sort roadworks by the blocked point X\n    roadworks.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])\n    \n    # Read each person's start time and calculate distances\n    for _ in range(Q):\n        D = int(input())\n        distance = -1  # Initialize distance as -1 (indicating walking forever)\n        \n        # Check each roadwork to see if it affects the current person\n        for S, T, X in roadworks:\n            if D < T and D + (distance if distance != -1 else 0) >= S:\n                # If the person starts before the roadwork ends and reaches the blocked point\n                if distance == -1 or X < distance:\n                    distance = X  # Update the distance to the nearest blocked point\n        \n        # Output the result for the current person\n        print(distance)\n\n# Call the function to execute the solution\nfind_distances()\n```",
