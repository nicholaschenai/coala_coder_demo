    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to determine how far each person can walk along a number line before encountering a blocked point due to scheduled roadworks. The key concepts involved understanding time intervals and how they interact with the positions of the roadworks and the starting times of the people.\n\nInitially, the approach involved reading the roadworks and sorting them by their blocked positions. The logic for checking if a person could reach a blocked point while it was still blocked was flawed. The conditions did not accurately account for the time it took for a person to reach a blocked point and whether that time fell within the blocked interval.\n\nThe successful strategy involved iterating through each person's start time and checking against each roadwork. The critical fix was ensuring that the time to reach a blocked point was calculated correctly and compared against the start and end times of the roadwork. This led to the correct implementation, which passed all test cases.\n\nThe final code snippet is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef find_distances():\n    # Read the number of roadworks and people\n    N, Q = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    # Initialize a list to store roadworks\n    roadworks = []\n    \n    # Read each roadwork's details\n    for _ in range(N):\n        S, T, X = map(int, input().split())\n        roadworks.append((S, T, X))\n    \n    # Sort roadworks by the blocked point X\n    roadworks.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])\n    \n    # Read each person's start time and calculate distances\n    for _ in range(Q):\n        D = int(input())\n        distance = -1  # Initialize distance as -1 (indicating walking forever)\n        \n        # Check each roadwork to see if it affects the current person\n        for S, T, X in roadworks:\n            if D < T:  # The person starts before the roadwork ends\n                # Calculate the time it takes for the person to reach the blocked point\n                time_to_reach = D + X  # Time when the person reaches X\n                if time_to_reach >= S and time_to_reach < T:\n                    # If the person reaches the blocked point while it is blocked\n                    if distance == -1 or X < distance:\n                        distance = X  # Update the distance to the nearest blocked point\n        \n        # Output the result for the current person\n        print(distance)\n\n# Call the function to execute the solution\nfind_distances()\n```\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering time intervals and conditions when dealing with problems involving movement and blocking events.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\nIn my initial approach to solving the problem, I focused on iterating through the roadworks for each person and checking if they could reach a blocked point while it was still blocked. While this method worked for the provided test cases, it was not efficient enough for larger inputs, as it involved nested loops that could lead to a time complexity of O(N * Q). \n\nThe official solution, on the other hand, employs a more efficient event-based approach using a priority queue (min-heap) to manage the blocked points dynamically. This method allows for a single pass through the events, which include the start and end of roadworks as well as the times when people start walking. By sorting all events and processing them in order, the solution efficiently determines the nearest blocked point for each person without needing to check each roadwork individually.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n1. **Event Representation**: Each roadwork generates two events (start and end), and each person's start time is also treated as an event. This allows for a unified way to handle all interactions on the number line.\n2. **Priority Queue**: The use of a priority queue allows for quick access to the nearest blocked point that is currently active, making it easy to determine if a person will encounter a blockage.\n3. **Efficient Processing**: By sorting all events and processing them in a single loop, the solution achieves a time complexity of O((N + Q) log(N + Q)), which is significantly more efficient than the nested loop approach.\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of considering different data structures and algorithms to optimize performance, especially in problems involving multiple entities interacting over time. The event-driven approach is a powerful technique that can be applied to similar problems in the future.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: find_distances]\nThis function reads the number of roadworks and people, then collects details about each roadwork, including their start and end times and the blocked point. It sorts the roadworks based on the blocked point to facilitate efficient checking. For each person, it calculates the distance to the nearest blocked point that affects their journey based on their start time. If a person reaches a blocked point while it is blocked, it updates the distance accordingly. Finally, it outputs the distance for each person, indicating if they can walk forever or the nearest blocked point they encounter.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios involving scheduling and planning where multiple events (like roadworks) can block paths for individuals (like pedestrians). It can be applied in traffic management systems, urban planning, and simulation of movement in constrained environments. Understanding how to calculate the impact of time-sensitive obstacles on movement can help in optimizing routes and improving safety measures. Additionally, this approach can be beneficial in algorithm design, particularly in problems involving intervals and searching for nearest events."
