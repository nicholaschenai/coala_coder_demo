## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The chef was playing with numbers and he found that natural number N can be obtained by sum various unique natural numbers, For challenging himself chef wrote one problem statement, which he decided to solve in future.
Problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
After that Cheffina came and read what chef wrote in the problem statement, for having some fun Cheffina made some changes in the problem statement as.
New problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of unique +ve integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
But, the chef is now confused, how to solve a new problem statement, help the chef to solve this new problem statement.

-----Input:-----
- First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
- Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers $N, K$. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line answer to the problem statement.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq K \leq 6$

-----Sample Input:-----
2
4 1
38 2

-----Sample Output:-----
2
1

-----EXPLANATION:-----
For 1) 4 can be obtained by as [ 4^1 ], [1^1, 3^1], [2^1, 2^1]. (here ^ stands for power)
But here [2^1, 2^1] is not the valid way because it is not made up of unique +ve integers. 
For 2) 38 can be obtained in the way which is [2^2, 3^2, 5^2] = 4 + 9 + 25

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem requires us to find the number of unique ways to express a natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of \( K \). Each test case provides values for \( N \) and \( K \), and we need to compute the number of valid combinations for each case.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with backtracking. We will:
   - Generate all possible unique integers whose \( K \)-th powers do not exceed \( N \).
   - Use a recursive function to explore combinations of these integers, checking if their \( K \)-th powers can sum up to \( N \).
   - Keep track of the current sum and the integers used to ensure they are unique.
   - Count the valid combinations that sum to \( N \).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function countWays(N, K):
       initialize a list to store unique integers whose K-th power is <= N
       for i from 1 to the maximum integer such that i^K <= N:
           add i to the list
       
       define a recursive function backtrack(current_sum, start_index):
           if current_sum == N:
               return 1  // found a valid combination
           if current_sum > N:
               return 0  // exceeded the target
           
           count = 0
           for i from start_index to the length of the list:
               count += backtrack(current_sum + list[i]^K, i + 1)  // move to the next integer
           return count
       
       return backtrack(0, 0)  // start with sum 0 and first index

   read T
   for each test case:
       read N, K
       print countWays(N, K)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def countWays(N, K):
    # Generate a list of unique integers whose K-th power is <= N
    unique_numbers = []
    i = 1
    while i ** K <= N:
        unique_numbers.append(i)
        i += 1

    # Recursive function to count the ways to sum to N using unique integers
    def backtrack(current_sum, start_index):
        if current_sum == N:
            return 1  # Found a valid combination
        if current_sum > N:
            return 0  # Exceeded the target
        
        count = 0
        for i in range(start_index, len(unique_numbers)):
            # Include unique_numbers[i] and move to the next index
            count += backtrack(current_sum + unique_numbers[i] ** K, i + 1)

    return backtrack(0, 0)  # Start with sum 0 and first index

    # Read N and K for each test case
    N, K = map(int, input().split())
    # Print the result for each test case

        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
           We need to find the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} such that a specific number I appears at the K-th position in the sorted order of the subset. We will handle multiple queries for each test case, and the results should be printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
           To solve this problem, we need to understand how to count the valid subsets:
           - For a number I to be at the K-th position in a subset, there must be exactly K-1 numbers that are less than I in the subset.
           - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than I.
           - We can use combinatorial counting to determine how many ways we can choose K-1 numbers from the numbers less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I.
           - The total number of valid subsets can be calculated using combinations and powers of 2.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at the K-th position in the sorted order of the subset. The solution required combinatorial counting, specifically using combinations and powers of 2 to account for the elements less than and greater than I.

    Key concepts included:
    - Understanding that for I to be at the K-th position, there must be exactly K-1 elements less than I in the subset.
    - Using precomputed factorials and their inverses to efficiently calculate combinations, which is crucial given the constraints (up to 4000 for N and up to 1,000,000 queries).

    The implemented solution involved:
    1. Precomputing factorials and their modular inverses using Fermat's little theorem.
    2. For each query, checking if K is valid (i.e., K ≤ I) and calculating the number of valid subsets using the formula for combinations and powers of 2.

    The final code was structured to read input, process multiple test cases, and output results efficiently. The solution passed all provided test cases, demonstrating its correctness and efficiency. 

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of combinatorial mathematics in subset problems and the utility of precomputation for handling large input sizes efficiently.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the number of ways to express a natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of \( K \). Each test case provides values for \( N \) and \( K \), and we need to compute the total number of valid combinations for each test case.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with memoization (or dynamic programming) to count the ways to form \( N \) using unique integers raised to the power of \( K \). The idea is to iterate through possible integers, compute their \( K \)-th power, and check if we can include that in our sum to reach \( N \). If we can include it, we recursively check for the remaining sum with the next integer.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the number of ways to express a natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of \( K \). Each test case provides values for \( N \) and \( K \), and we need to compute the total number of valid combinations for each test case.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with memoization (or dynamic programming) to count the ways to form \( N \) using unique integers raised to the power of \( K \). The idea is to iterate through possible integers, compute their \( K \)-th power, and check if we can include that in our sum to reach \( N \). If we can include it, we recursively check for the remaining sum with the next integer.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The chef was playing with numbers and he found that natural number N can be obtained by sum various unique natural numbers, For challenging himself chef wrote one problem statement, which he decided to solve in future.
Problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
After that Cheffina came and read what chef wrote in the problem statement, for having some fun Cheffina made some changes in the problem statement as.
New problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of unique +ve integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
But, the chef is now confused, how to solve a new problem statement, help the chef to solve this new problem statement.

-----Input:-----
- First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
- Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers $N, K$. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line answer to the problem statement.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq K \leq 6$

-----Sample Input:-----
2
4 1
38 2

-----Sample Output:-----
2
1

-----EXPLANATION:-----
For 1) 4 can be obtained by as [ 4^1 ], [1^1, 3^1], [2^1, 2^1]. (here ^ stands for power)
But here [2^1, 2^1] is not the valid way because it is not made up of unique +ve integers. 
For 2) 38 can be obtained in the way which is [2^2, 3^2, 5^2] = 4 + 9 + 25

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.

    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] The problem involved finding the number of ways to express a natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of \( K \). The solution required a recursive approach with memoization or dynamic programming to efficiently count valid combinations.

Key concepts included:
- Recursive exploration of including or excluding integers raised to the \( K \)-th power.
- Base cases to handle when the sum reaches zero (valid combination) or goes negative (invalid combination).
- The use of a helper function to manage the current integer being considered.

The implemented solution successfully handled the test cases provided, demonstrating that the recursive strategy was effective. The code structure involved a main function to read input and invoke the recursive counting function, which was designed to explore all combinations systematically.

The final code snippet is as follows:

```python
def count_ways(N, K, current):
    if N == 0:
        return 1
    if N < 0 or current > N:
        return 0
    
    current_power = current ** K
    include_current = count_ways(N - current_power, K, current + 1)
    skip_current = count_ways(N, K, current + 1)
    
    return include_current + skip_current

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    T = int(data[0])
    results = []
    for i in range(1, T + 1):

        results.append(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res)

main()
```

This experience reinforced the importance of recursive problem-solving techniques and the need for careful management of base cases to ensure correct results.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for _ in range(int(input())):
    x,n = map(int,input().split())
    reach = [0]*(x+1)
    reach[0] = 1
    i=1
    while i**n<=x:
        j = 1
        while j+i**n<=x:
            j+=1
        j-=1
        while j>=0:
            if reach[j]>0:
                reach[j+i**n]+=reach[j]
            j-=1
        i+=1
    #print(reach)
    print(reach[-1])

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] The official solution employs a dynamic programming approach to efficiently count the number of ways to express \( N \) as the sum of unique integers raised to the power of \( K \). Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The solution uses an array `reach` where `reach[j]` represents the number of ways to sum up to \( j \) using unique integers raised to the power of \( K \). The array is initialized with `reach[0] = 1`, indicating that there is one way to achieve a sum of zero (by using no numbers).

2. **Iterating Over Integers**: The outer loop iterates over integers \( i \) starting from 1. For each integer, it calculates \( i^n \) and checks if it can be used to form sums up to \( x \).

3. **Updating the DP Array**: The inner loop first determines how many times \( i^n \) can be added without exceeding \( x \). It then updates the `reach` array in reverse order to ensure that each integer is only used once in forming the sums.

4. **Final Result**: After processing all integers, the final result is found in `reach[x]`, which gives the total number of ways to form \( N \).

The official solution is more efficient than my initial recursive approach, particularly because it avoids the overhead of recursive calls and uses a single pass through the integers and sums. The use of a dynamic programming array allows for a clear accumulation of results, ensuring that each unique integer is only counted once. 

In future problems involving combinations or sums, leveraging dynamic programming can significantly improve performance and clarity. The approach of iterating in reverse when updating the DP array is a crucial technique to prevent overcounting. This experience reinforces the importance of considering both recursive and iterative solutions, especially in combinatorial problems.

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, N and K. It initializes a process to count the number of ways to express N as a sum of K-th powers of integers starting from 1. For each test case, it computes the result using a specific counting method and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases sequentially. The function effectively handles input and output while delegating the computation to another process.

[Problem]
    The chef was playing with numbers and he found that natural number N can be obtained by sum various unique natural numbers, For challenging himself chef wrote one problem statement, which he decided to solve in future.
    Problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
    After that Cheffina came and read what chef wrote in the problem statement, for having some fun Cheffina made some changes in the problem statement as.
    New problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of unique +ve integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
    But, the chef is now confused, how to solve a new problem statement, help the chef to solve this new problem statement.

    -----Input:-----
    - First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
    - Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers $N, K$. 

    -----Output:-----
    For each test case, output in a single line answer to the problem statement.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 10$
    - $1 \leq N \leq 1000$
    - $1 \leq K \leq 6$

    -----Sample Input:-----
    2
    4 1
    38 2

    -----Sample Output:-----
    2
    1

    -----EXPLANATION:-----
    For 1) 4 can be obtained by as [ 4^1 ], [1^1, 3^1], [2^1, 2^1]. (here ^ stands for power)
    But here [2^1, 2^1] is not the valid way because it is not made up of unique +ve integers. 
    For 2) 38 can be obtained in the way which is [2^2, 3^2, 5^2] = 4 + 9 + 25
