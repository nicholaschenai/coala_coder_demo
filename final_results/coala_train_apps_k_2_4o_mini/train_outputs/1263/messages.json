Precomputing factorials and their modular inverses using Fermat's little theorem.\n    2. For each query, checking if K is valid (i.e., K \u2264 I) and calculating the number of valid subsets using the formula for combinations and powers of 2.\n\n    The final code was structured to read input, process multiple test cases, and output results efficiently. The solution passed all provided test cases, demonstrating its correctness and efficiency. \n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of combinatorial mathematics in subset problems and the utility of precomputation for handling large input sizes efficiently.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

        "content": "The official solution employs a dynamic programming approach to efficiently count the number of ways to express \\( N \\) as the sum of unique integers raised to the power of \\( K \\). Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The solution uses an array `reach` where `reach[j]` represents the number of ways to sum up to \\( j \\) using unique integers raised to the power of \\( K \\). The array is initialized with `reach[0] = 1`, indicating that there is one way to achieve a sum of zero (by using no numbers).\n\n2. **Iterating Over Integers**: The outer loop iterates over integers \\( i \\) starting from 1. For each integer, it calculates \\( i^n \\) and checks if it can be used to form sums up to \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Updating the DP Array**: The inner loop first determines how many times \\( i^n \\) can be added without exceeding \\( x \\). It then updates the `reach` array in reverse order to ensure that each integer is only used once in forming the sums.\n\n4. **Final Result**: After processing all integers, the final result is found in `reach[x]`, which gives the total number of ways to form \\( N \\).\n\n### Reflection:\nThe official solution is more efficient than my initial recursive approach, particularly because it avoids the overhead of recursive calls and uses a single pass through the integers and sums. The use of a dynamic programming array allows for a clear accumulation of results, ensuring that each unique integer is only counted once. \n\nIn future problems involving combinations or sums, leveraging dynamic programming can significantly improve performance and clarity. The approach of iterating in reverse when updating the DP array is a crucial technique to prevent overcounting. This experience reinforces the importance of considering both recursive and iterative solutions, especially in combinatorial problems."

        "content": "\n[description for function: main]\nThis function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, N and K. It initializes a process to count the number of ways to express N as a sum of K-th powers of integers starting from 1. For each test case, it computes the result using a specific counting method and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases sequentially. The function effectively handles input and output while delegating the computation to another process.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to find combinations of unique integers that sum up to a specific number, particularly when the integers are raised to a certain power. This can be applied in combinatorial mathematics, algorithm design, and optimization problems where constraints on uniqueness and specific forms of summation are required. It can also be relevant in programming contests or academic settings where such problems are common."
