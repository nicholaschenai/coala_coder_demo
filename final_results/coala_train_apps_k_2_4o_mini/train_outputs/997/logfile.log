## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Dr. S. De teaches computer architecture in NIT Patna. Whenever he comes across any good question(with complexity $k$), he gives that question to students within roll number range $i$ and $j$
At the start of semester he assigns score of $10$ to every student in his class if a student submits a question of complexity $k$, his score gets multiplied by $k$
This month he gave $M$ questions and he is wondering what will be mean of maximum scores of all the student. He is busy in improving his finger print attendance module, can you help him?
Input file may be large so try to use fast input output

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a First line of input, two integers $N, M$ i.e. Number of students in the class and number of questions given in this month. 
- Next $M$ lines contains 3 integers -$i, j, k$ i.e. starting roll number, end roll number and complexity of the question

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line answer - $floor$ value of Mean of maximum possible score for all students.

-----Constraints-----

INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Dr. S. De assigns scores to students based on the complexity of questions they solve. Each student starts with a score of 10. When a student solves a question of a certain complexity, their score is multiplied by that complexity. Given multiple questions and the range of students who can solve them, we need to calculate the mean of the maximum scores of all students after all questions have been assigned.

2. **Conceptualize a solution:**
   - Start by initializing a list of scores for all students, each set to 10.
   - For each question, update the scores of the specified range of students by multiplying their current score by the complexity of the question.
   - After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and return the floor value of that mean.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function calculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, M
           initialize scores list with 10 for each student
           for each question in M:
               read i, j, k
               for student in range(i to j):
                   scores[student] *= k
           mean_score = sum(scores) // N
           print mean_score
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 solution:**
```python
def calculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, M = case[0]
        scores = [10] * N  # Initialize scores for N students
        for question in case[1]:
            i, j, k = question
            for student in range(i - 1, j):  # Adjusting for 0-based index
                scores[student] *= k
        mean_score = sum(scores) // N  # Calculate floor of mean
        results.append(mean_score)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a shelf of books numbered from 1 to N. The key insight was to identify the longest increasing subsequence of books that are already in the correct order. The minimum moves needed would then be the total number of books minus the length of this subsequence.

    The solution involved creating an array to track the positions of each book and then iterating through the books in order to find the longest increasing subsequence based on their positions. This approach efficiently computes the result in linear time, which is crucial given the constraints (up to 200,000 books).

    The final implementation successfully passed the provided test case, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:

    ```python
    def min_moves_to_sort(N, books):
        position = [0] * (N + 1)
        for i in range(N):
            position[books[i]] = i

        longest_increasing_length = 0
        current_length = 0

        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            if position[i] > position[i - 1]:
                current_length += 1
            else:
                longest_increasing_length = max(longest_increasing_length, current_length)
                current_length = 1

        longest_increasing_length = max(longest_increasing_length, current_length)

        return N - (longest_increasing_length + 1)

    # Read input
    N = int(input())
    books = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Output the result
    print(min_moves_to_sort(N, books))
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in sorting problems and leveraging efficient algorithms to handle large datasets.

        Given $N$, $M$, $A$ and $B$, compute $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{N-1} \lfloor \frac{A \cdot i + B}{M} \rfloor$.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        This is the most technically troublesome problem so far.

        It is possible to use the same approach and construct the full convex hull of points below the line $y = \frac{Ax+B}{M}$.

        We already know how to solve it for $B = 0$. Moreover, we already know how to construct this convex hull up to the closest lattice point to this line on $[0, N-1]$ segment (this is done in the "Crime and Punishment" problem above.

        Now we should note that once we reached the closest point to the line, we can just assume that the line in fact passes through the closest point, as there are no other lattice points on $[0, N-1]$ in between the actual line and the line moved slightly below to pass through the closest point.

        That being said, to construct the full convex hull below the line $y=\frac{Ax+B}{M}$ on $[0, N-1]$, we can construct it up to the closest point to the line on $[0, N-1]$ and then continue as if the line passes through this point, reusing algorithm for constructing convex hull with $B=0$:

    !!! example "[OKC 2 - From Modular to Rational](https://codeforces.com/gym/102354/problem/I)"
        There is a rational number $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$. You may ask the value of $p q^{-1}$ modulo $m \sim 10^9$ for several prime numbers $m$. Recover $\frac{p}{q}$.

        _Equivalent formulation:_ Find $x$ that delivers the minimum of $Ax \;\bmod\; M$ for $1 \leq x \leq N$.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        Due to Chinese remainder theorem, asking the result modulo several prime numbers is the same as asking it modulo their product. Due to this, without loss of generality we'll assume that we know the remainder modulo sufficiently large number $m$.

        There could be several possible solutions $(p, q)$ to $p \equiv qr \pmod m$ for a given remainder $r$. However, if $(p_1, q_1)$ and $(p_2, q_2)$ are both the solutions then it also holds that $p_1 q_2 \equiv p_2 q_1 \pmod m$. Assuming that $\frac{p_1}{q_1} \neq \frac{p_2}{q_2}$ it means that $|p_1 q_2 - p_2 q_1|$ is at least $m$.

        In the statement we were told that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$, so if both $p_1, q_1$ and $p_2, q_2$ are at most $10^9$, then the difference is at most $10^{18}$. For $m > 10^{18}$ it means that the solution $\frac{p}{q}$ with $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$ is unique, as a rational number.

        So, the problem boils down, given $r$ modulo $m$, to finding any $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr \;\bmod\; m \leq 10^9$.

        This is effectively the same as finding $q$ that delivers the minimum possible $qr \bmod m$ for $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$.

        For $qr = km + b$ it means that we need to find a pair $(q, m)$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr - km \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        Since $m$ is constant, we can divide by it and further restate it as find $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $\frac{r}{m} q - k \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        In terms of continued fractions it means that $\frac{k}{q}$ is the best diophantine approximation to $\frac{r}{m}$ and it is sufficient to only check lower semiconvergents of $\frac{r}{m}$.

        === "Python"
            ```py
            # find Q that minimizes Q*r mod m for 1 <= k <= n < m 
            def mod_min(r, n, m):
                a = fraction(r, m)
                p, q = convergents(a)
                for i in range(2, len(q)):
                    if i % 2 == 1 and (i + 1 == len(q) or q[i+1] > n):
                        t = (n - q[i-1]) // q[i]

INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Dr. S. De assigns scores to students based on the complexity of questions they solve. Each student starts with a score of 10, and if they solve a question of complexity `k`, their score is multiplied by `k`. Given multiple questions and the range of students who can solve them, we need to calculate the mean of the maximum scores of all students after all questions have been assigned.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Start by initializing an array to hold the scores of all students, initially set to 10.
   - For each question, update the scores of the students in the specified range by multiplying their current score by the complexity of the question.
   - After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores by summing them up and dividing by the number of students, then take the floor of that value.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Dr. S. De assigns scores to students based on the complexity of questions they solve. Each student starts with a score of 10, and if they solve a question of complexity `k`, their score is multiplied by `k`. Given multiple questions and the range of students who can solve them, we need to calculate the mean of the maximum scores of all students after all questions have been assigned.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Start by initializing an array to hold the scores of all students, initially set to 10.
   - For each question, update the scores of the students in the specified range by multiplying their current score by the complexity of the question.
   - After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores by summing them up and dividing by the number of students, then take the floor of that value.

INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] In this task, I was required to calculate the mean of maximum scores for students based on the complexity of questions assigned to them. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve. The challenge involved efficiently updating scores for potentially large numbers of students and questions.

The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate an array based on given ranges and perform arithmetic operations efficiently. The solution involved initializing an array of scores, iterating through the questions, and updating the scores for the specified range of students. After processing all questions, the mean score was calculated by summing the scores and dividing by the number of students.

The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that the mean score was printed as an integer. The code was structured to read input in bulk for efficiency, especially given the constraints of up to 100,000 students and questions. 

Key takeaways include the importance of efficient array manipulation and the need to consider performance when dealing with large datasets. The solution was straightforward and did not encounter unexpected errors, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem requirements. 

Here is the final code snippet for reference:

INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] The official solution employs a dictionary to track the scores of students, which allows for dynamic updates without needing to initialize a fixed-size array. This approach is particularly useful when the number of students (N) is large, but not all students are affected by the questions, as it avoids unnecessary memory allocation for students who remain at their initial score of 10.

Key insights from the official solution:

1. **Dynamic Score Tracking**: Instead of initializing an array of size N, the solution uses a dictionary (`d`) to store only the scores of students who have been affected by the questions. This is efficient in terms of both time and space, especially when many students do not participate in solving questions.

2. **Iterative Updates**: The solution iterates through the range of students affected by each question and updates their scores directly in the dictionary. This avoids the need for a separate loop to initialize scores, as it checks for the existence of a key in the dictionary before updating.

3. **Final Score Calculation**: After processing all questions, the solution sums the scores stored in the dictionary and divides by the total number of students (N) to get the mean score, using integer division to achieve the floor value directly.

4. **Error Handling**: The use of a try-except block allows the program to handle unexpected input gracefully, although in a competitive programming context, this might not be necessary.

Overall, the official solution is more efficient in terms of memory usage and handles the problem's constraints effectively. In future implementations, considering the use of dictionaries for sparse data can lead to more optimal solutions.

The main function is `calculate_mean_scores`.
INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] The function processes multiple test cases to calculate and print the mean scores of students based on their performance in a series of questions. For each test case, it initializes all students' scores to 10 and then updates these scores according to the complexity of questions answered by specified ranges of students. After processing all questions for a test case, it computes the mean score by summing the scores and dividing by the number of students. The mean score is then printed for each test case. This function effectively handles the input and output of scores while ensuring that the calculations are performed efficiently. It is designed to work with a specified number of test cases and their corresponding data.

[Problem]
    Dr. S. De teaches computer architecture in NIT Patna. Whenever he comes across any good question(with complexity $k$), he gives that question to students within roll number range $i$ and $j$
    At the start of semester he assigns score of $10$ to every student in his class if a student submits a question of complexity $k$, his score gets multiplied by $k$
    This month he gave $M$ questions and he is wondering what will be mean of maximum scores of all the student. He is busy in improving his finger print attendance module, can you help him?
    Input file may be large so try to use fast input output

    -----Input:-----
    - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
    - Each testcase contains of a First line of input, two integers $N, M$ i.e. Number of students in the class and number of questions given in this month. 
    - Next $M$ lines contains 3 integers -$i, j, k$ i.e. starting roll number, end roll number and complexity of the question

    -----Output:-----
    For each testcase, output in a single line answer - $floor$ value of Mean of maximum possible score for all students.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 100$
    - $1 \leq N, M \leq 10^5$
    - $1 \leq i \leq j \leq N$
    - $1 \leq k \leq 100$

    - 
    $1 \leq T \leq 10$
    - 
    $1 \leq N, M \leq 10^4$
    Subtask2

    Original Constraints 

    -----Sample Input:-----
    1
    5 3
    1 3 5
    2 5 2
    3 4 7

    -----Sample Output:-----
    202

    -----EXPLANATION:-----
    Initial score of students will be : $[10, 10, 10, 10, 10]$
    after solving question 1 scores will be: $[50, 50, 50, 10, 10]$
    after solving question 2 scores will be: $[50, 100, 100, 20, 20]$
    after solving question 1 scores will be: $[50, 100, 700, 140, 20]$
    Hence after all questions mean of maximum scores will $(50+100+700+140+20)/5 = 202$
