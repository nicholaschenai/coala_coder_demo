The key insight was to identify the longest increasing subsequence of books that are already in the correct order. The minimum moves needed would then be the total number of books minus the length of this subsequence.\n\n    The solution involved creating an array to track the positions of each book and then iterating through the books in order to find the longest increasing subsequence based on their positions. This approach efficiently computes the result in linear time, which is crucial given the constraints (up to 200,000 books).\n\n    The final implementation successfully passed the provided test case, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def min_moves_to_sort(N, books):\n        position = [0] * (N + 1)\n        for i in range(N):\n            position[books[i]] = i\n\n        longest_increasing_length = 0\n        current_length = 0\n\n        for i in range(1, N + 1):\n            if position[i] > position[i - 1]:\n                current_length += 1\n            else:\n                longest_increasing_length = max(longest_increasing_length, current_length)\n                current_length = 1\n\n        longest_increasing_length = max(longest_increasing_length, current_length)\n\n        return N - (longest_increasing_length + 1)\n\n    # Read input\n    N = int(input())\n    books = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n    # Output the result\n    print(min_moves_to_sort(N, books))\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in sorting problems and leveraging efficient algorithms to handle large datasets.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Continued fractions\n    Part: 12/12\n    ```\n        === \"Python\"\n            ```py\n            def solve(p, q, N):\n                return p * N * (N + 1) // 2 - q * sum_floor(fraction(p, q), N)\n            ``` \n\n    !!! example \"[Library Checker - Sum of Floor of Linear](https://judge.yosupo.jp/problem/sum_of_floor_of_linear)\"\n        Given $N$, $M$, $A$ and $B$, compute $\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{N-1} \\lfloor \\frac{A \\cdot i + B}{M} \\rfloor$.\n\n    ??? hint \"Solution\"\n        This is the most technically troublesome problem so far.\n\n        It is possible to use the same approach and construct the full convex hull of points below the line $y = \\frac{Ax+B}{M}$.\n\n        We already know how to solve it for $B = 0$.

You may ask the value of $p q^{-1}$ modulo $m \\sim 10^9$ for several prime numbers $m$. Recover $\\frac{p}{q}$.\n\n        _Equivalent formulation:_ Find $x$ that delivers the minimum of $Ax \\;\\bmod\\; M$ for $1 \\leq x \\leq N$.\n\n    ??? hint \"Solution\"\n        Due to Chinese remainder theorem, asking the result modulo several prime numbers is the same as asking it modulo their product. Due to this, without loss of generality we'll assume that we know the remainder modulo sufficiently large number $m$.\n\n        There could be several possible solutions $(p, q)$ to $p \\equiv qr \\pmod m$ for a given remainder $r$. However, if $(p_1, q_1)$ and $(p_2, q_2)$ are both the solutions then it also holds that $p_1 q_2 \\equiv p_2 q_1 \\pmod m$. Assuming that $\\frac{p_1}{q_1} \\neq \\frac{p_2}{q_2}$ it means that $|p_1 q_2 - p_2 q_1|$ is at least $m$.\n\n        In the statement we were told that $1 \\leq p, q \\leq 10^9$, so if both $p_1, q_1$ and $p_2, q_2$ are at most $10^9$, then the difference is at most $10^{18}$. For $m > 10^{18}$ it means that the solution $\\frac{p}{q}$ with $1 \\leq p, q \\leq 10^9$ is unique, as a rational number.\n\n        So, the problem boils down, given $r$ modulo $m$, to finding any $q$ such that $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$ and $qr \\;\\bmod\\; m \\leq 10^9$.\n\n        This is effectively the same as finding $q$ that delivers the minimum possible $qr \\bmod m$ for $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$.\n\n        For $qr = km + b$ it means that we need to find a pair $(q, m)$ such that $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$ and $qr - km \\geq 0$ is the minimum possible.\n\n        Since $m$ is constant, we can divide by it and further restate it as find $q$ such that $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$ and $\\frac{r}{m} q - k \\geq 0$ is the minimum possible.\n\n        In terms of continued fractions it means that $\\frac{k}{q}$ is the best diophantine approximation to $\\frac{r}{m}$ and it is sufficient to only check lower semiconvergents of $\\frac{r}{m}$.\n\n        === \"Python\"\n            ```py\n            # find Q that minimizes Q*r mod m for 1 <= k <= n < m \n            def mod_min(r, n, m):\n                a = fraction(r, m)\n                p, q = convergents(a)\n                for i in range(2, len(q)):\n                    if i % 2 == 1 and (i + 1 == len(q) or q[i+1] > n):\n                        t = (n - q[i-1]) // q[i]\n                        return q[i-1] + t*q[i]\n            ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

        "content": "The official solution employs a dictionary to track the scores of students, which allows for dynamic updates without needing to initialize a fixed-size array. This approach is particularly useful when the number of students (N) is large, but not all students are affected by the questions, as it avoids unnecessary memory allocation for students who remain at their initial score of 10.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Dynamic Score Tracking**: Instead of initializing an array of size N, the solution uses a dictionary (`d`) to store only the scores of students who have been affected by the questions. This is efficient in terms of both time and space, especially when many students do not participate in solving questions.\n\n2. **Iterative Updates**: The solution iterates through the range of students affected by each question and updates their scores directly in the dictionary. This avoids the need for a separate loop to initialize scores, as it checks for the existence of a key in the dictionary before updating.\n\n3. **Final Score Calculation**: After processing all questions, the solution sums the scores stored in the dictionary and divides by the total number of students (N) to get the mean score, using integer division to achieve the floor value directly.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: The use of a try-except block allows the program to handle unexpected input gracefully, although in a competitive programming context, this might not be necessary.\n\nOverall, the official solution is more efficient in terms of memory usage and handles the problem's constraints effectively. In future implementations, considering the use of dictionaries for sparse data can lead to more optimal solutions."

For each test case, it initializes all students' scores to 10 and then updates these scores according to the complexity of questions answered by specified ranges of students. After processing all questions for a test case, it computes the mean score by summing the scores and dividing by the number of students. The mean score is then printed for each test case. This function effectively handles the input and output of scores while ensuring that the calculations are performed efficiently. It is designed to work with a specified number of test cases and their corresponding data.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to calculate the impact of multiple operations on a range of elements in an array, especially when the operations can vary in complexity and affect different segments of the array. It can be applied in educational settings for grading systems, in gaming for score calculations, or in any system where batch updates to a set of values are required. Understanding how to efficiently manage and compute these updates is crucial for performance, especially with large datasets."
