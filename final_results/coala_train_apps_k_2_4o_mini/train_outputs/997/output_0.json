    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   Dr. S. De assigns scores to students based on the complexity of questions they solve. Each student starts with a score of 10, and if they solve a question of complexity `k`, their score is multiplied by `k`. Given multiple questions and the range of students who can solve them, we need to calculate the mean of the maximum scores of all students after all questions have been assigned.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - Start by initializing an array to hold the scores of all students, initially set to 10.\n   - For each question, update the scores of the students in the specified range by multiplying their current score by the complexity of the question.\n   - After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores by summing them up and dividing by the number of students, then take the floor of that value.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function calculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           N, M = test_case[0]\n           scores = array of size N initialized to 10\n           for each question in test_case[1:M]:\n               i, j, k = question\n               for student in range(i-1 to j):\n                   scores[student] *= k\n           mean_score = sum(scores) // N\n           print(mean_score\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef calculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases):\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N, M = case[0]  # Number of students and questions\n        scores = [10] * N  # Initialize scores for all students to 10\n        \n        for question in case[1]:  # Process each question\n            i, j, k = question  # Get the range and complexity\n            for student in range(i - 1, j):  # Update scores for students in range\n                scores[student] *= k\n        \n        mean_score = sum(scores) // N  # Calculate the mean score\n        print(mean_score)  # Output the mean score\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().splitlines()\n\nT = int(data[0])  # Number of test cases\ntest_cases = []\nindex = 1\n\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N, M = map(int, data[index].split())\n    questions = []\n    for j in range(M):\n        i, j, k = map(int, data[index + 1 + j].split())\n        questions.append((i, j, k))\n    test_cases.append(((N, M), questions))\n    index += M + 1\n\n# Call the function with the parsed input\ncalculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases)\n```",
