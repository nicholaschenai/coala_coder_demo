    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We have a series of hills with different heights, and we need to determine the minimum number of water reservoirs required to supply water to all the hills. Each reservoir can supply water in one direction (left or right) until it reaches a taller hill. The goal is to find the optimal placement and direction for the reservoirs to minimize their number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of hills and determine the points where we need to place reservoirs. We can keep track of the highest hill encountered so far as we move from left to right and from right to left. If a hill is taller than the highest hill we've seen in the current direction, we will need a reservoir there. By checking both directions, we can ensure that we cover all hills with the minimum number of reservoirs.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function min_reservoirs(N, heights):\n       left_max = 0\n       right_max = 0\n       reservoirs = 0\n       \n       # Check from left to right\n       for i from 0 to N-1:\n           if heights[i] > left_max:\n               left_max = heights[i]\n               reservoirs += 1\n       \n       # Check from right to left\n       for i from N-1 to 0:\n           if heights[i] > right_max:\n               right_max = heights[i]\n               reservoirs += 1\n       \n       return reservoirs\n       \n   function process_test_cases(T):\n       for each test case:\n           read N\n           read heights\n           print min_reservoirs(N, heights)\n\n   read T\n   process_test_cases(T)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef min_reservoirs(N, heights):\n    # Initialize variables to track the maximum heights seen from both directions\n    left_max = 0\n    right_max = 0\n    reservoirs = 0\n    \n    # Check from left to right\n    for i in range(N):\n        if heights[i] > left_max:\n            left_max = heights[i]\n            reservoirs += 1  # We need a reservoir here\n    \n    # Check from right to left\n    for i in range(N-1, -1, -1):\n        if heights[i] > right_max:\n            right_max = heights[i]\n            reservoirs += 1  # We need a reservoir here\n    \n    return reservoirs\n\ndef process_test_cases(T):\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        heights = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        print(min_reservoirs(N, heights))\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nprocess_test_cases(T)\n```",
