    "summary": "### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Reservoir Problem\n\nThe problem involved determining the minimum number of reservoirs needed to supply water to a series of hills, where each reservoir can supply water in one direction until it reaches a taller hill. The key challenge was to ensure that reservoirs were counted correctly without double counting.\n\n#### Key Concepts:\n1. **Reservoir Placement**: A reservoir should be placed on a hill if it is taller than all previously encountered hills in the direction of water flow.\n2. **Two-Pass Strategy**: The solution requires two passes through the list of hills:\n   - One from left to right to count reservoirs.\n   - Another from right to left to count reservoirs.\n3. **Avoiding Double Counting**: The tallest hill will be counted in both passes, necessitating a correction to the final count.\n\n#### Attempts and Errors:\n- The initial attempts incorrectly counted reservoirs by marking hills as covered, leading to inflated counts. The logic for marking coverage was flawed, as it did not account for the fact that a single reservoir could supply multiple hills.\n- The final approach attempted to count reservoirs in both directions but still resulted in incorrect counts due to not properly managing the double counting of the tallest hill.\n\n#### Final Code Snippet:\n```python\ndef min_reservoirs(N, heights):\n    reservoirs = 0\n    left_max = 0\n    \n    for i in range(N):\n        if heights[i] > left_max:\n            left_max = heights[i]\n            reservoirs += 1  # Need a reservoir here\n    \n    right_max = 0\n    for i in range(N-1, -1, -1):\n        if heights[i] > right_max:\n            right_max = heights[i]\n            reservoirs += 1  # Need a reservoir here\n    \n    if N > 0:\n        reservoirs -= 1  # Adjust for double counting\n    \n    return reservoirs\n```\n\n#### Lessons Learned:\n- The importance of clearly defining the conditions under which reservoirs are counted.\n- The necessity of careful management of counts to avoid double counting, especially in problems involving directional flow or coverage.\n- The need for thorough testing with various input cases to ensure the solution is robust.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\nIn my attempts to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of reservoirs needed for the hills, I initially focused on counting reservoirs based on the maximum heights encountered from both directions. However, this approach led to incorrect results due to double counting and not properly accounting for the optimal placement of reservoirs.\n\nThe official solution takes a different approach by leveraging recursion. It identifies the index of the tallest hill and uses it as a pivot. If the tallest hill is at either end, only one reservoir is needed. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the number of reservoirs needed for the left and right segments of the list, adding one for the tallest hill itself. This method effectively reduces the problem size with each recursive call, ensuring that all hills are covered optimally.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n1. **Identify the Tallest Hill**: The tallest hill serves as a natural dividing point for the problem.\n2. **Base Cases**: If the tallest hill is at the ends, only one reservoir is needed.\n3. **Recursive Division**: The problem is broken down into smaller subproblems, calculating the reservoirs needed for the segments on either side of the tallest hill.\n\nThis recursive approach is more elegant and efficient than my iterative method, as it directly addresses the problem's structure and avoids unnecessary complexity. In future problem-solving scenarios, I will consider using recursive strategies for problems that exhibit similar characteristics, especially when a natural pivot or dividing point exists.",
