    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a basic calculator that can evaluate simple mathematical expressions given as strings. The expressions can include numbers, addition and subtraction operators, parentheses, and spaces. The goal is to compute the result of the expression without using any built-in evaluation functions.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach. We will iterate through the characters of the expression string. When we encounter a number, we will build it up and push it onto a stack. When we encounter an operator, we will check the top of the stack to see if we need to perform any calculations based on the operator's precedence. Parentheses will require us to evaluate the expression inside them first. We will maintain two stacks: one for numbers and one for operators. At the end of the iteration, we will process any remaining operators in the stack to get the final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function calculate(expression):\n       initialize an empty stack for numbers\n       initialize an empty stack for operators\n       initialize a variable for the current number\n       initialize a variable for the last operator (default to '+')\n       \n       for each character in the expression:\n           if character is a digit:\n               build the current number\n           if character is an operator or a parenthesis:\n               if last operator is '+':\n                   push current number onto numbers stack\n               if last operator is '-':\n                   push -current number onto numbers stack\n               if character is '(':\n                   push the last operator onto operators stack\n               if character is ')':\n                   while operators stack is not empty and top is not '(':\n                       pop from operators stack and apply to numbers stack\n               reset current number\n               update last operator\n       \n       while operators stack is not empty:\n           pop from operators stack and apply to numbers stack\n       \n       return the sum of numbers stack\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:\n        # Initialize stacks for numbers and operators\n        num_stack = []\n        op_stack = []\n        current_num = 0\n        last_op = '+'  # Default operator\n        \n        # Iterate through each character in the string\n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            char = s[i]\n            \n            if char.isdigit():  # If the character is a digit\n                current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)  # Build the current number\n            \n            if char in \"+-() \" or i == len(s) - 1:  # If the character is an operator or a parenthesis\n                if last_op == '+':  # If the last operator was '+'\n                    num_stack.append(current_num)  # Push current number onto the stack\n                elif last_op == '-':  # If the last operator was '-'\n                    num_stack.append(-current_num)  # Push negative current number onto the stack\n                \n                if char == '(':  # If the character is an opening parenthesis\n                    op_stack.append(last_op)  # Push the last operator onto the operator stack\n                \n                if char == ')':  # If the character is a closing parenthesis\n                    while op_stack and op_stack[-1] != '(':  # Process until we find the matching '('\n                        op = op_stack.pop()  # Pop the operator\n                        if op == '+':\n                            num_stack.append(num_stack.pop() + num_stack.pop())\n                        elif op == '-':\n                            num_stack.append(-num_stack.pop() + num_stack.pop())\n                \n                current_num = 0  # Reset current number\n                last_op = char  # Update last operator\n        \n        # Process any remaining operators in the stack\n        while op_stack:\n            op = op_stack.pop()\n            if op == '+':\n                num_stack.append(num_stack.pop() + num_stack.pop())\n            elif op == '-':\n                num_stack.append(-num_stack.pop() + num_stack.pop())\n        \n        return sum(num_stack)  # Return the sum of the numbers in the stack\n```",
