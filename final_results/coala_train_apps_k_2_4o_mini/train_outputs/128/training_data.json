    "summary": "In this task, I implemented a basic calculator to evaluate mathematical expressions given as strings. The core concepts involved parsing the string, handling numbers, operators, and parentheses, and using stacks to manage the order of operations.\n\nInitially, the implementation had issues with processing operators and parentheses correctly. The main problems included not properly evaluating expressions within parentheses and failing to handle the last number in the expression. The logic for managing the operator and number stacks was also flawed, leading to incorrect results.\n\nTo fix these issues, I revised the code to ensure that:\n- Each number is fully processed before moving on to the next operator.\n- Parentheses are handled correctly by evaluating the expression inside them first.\n- The last number is processed correctly, even if it appears at the end of the string.\n\nThe final implementation uses two stacks: one for numbers and one for operators, allowing for proper evaluation of the expression. The code successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the adjustments made were effective.\n\nHere\u2019s the final working code snippet:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:\n        num_stack = []\n        op_stack = []\n        current_num = 0\n        last_op = '+'  \n        s = s.replace(\" \", \"\")  \n        \n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            char = s[i]\n            \n            if char.isdigit():\n                current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)\n            \n            if char in \"+-()\" or i == len(s) - 1:\n                if last_op == '+':\n                    num_stack.append(current_num)\n                elif last_op == '-':\n                    num_stack.append(-current_num)\n                \n                if char == '(':\n                    op_stack.append(last_op)\n                \n                if char == ')':\n                    while op_stack and op_stack[-1] != '(':\n                        op = op_stack.pop()\n                        if op == '+':\n                            num_stack.append(num_stack.pop() + num_stack.pop())\n                        elif op == '-':\n                            num_stack.append(-num_stack.pop() + num_stack.pop())\n                    op_stack.pop()\n                \n                current_num = 0\n                last_op = char\n        \n        if last_op == '+':\n            num_stack.append(current_num)\n        elif last_op == '-':\n            num_stack.append(-current_num)\n        \n        return sum(num_stack)\n```\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of careful parsing and stack management in evaluating expressions, especially when dealing with nested structures like parentheses.",
    "reflection": "The official solution provides a clear and efficient approach to evaluating a mathematical expression with support for addition, subtraction, and parentheses. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that can be useful for future reference:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The solution initializes variables for the result (`res`), the current number (`num`), the current sign (`sign`), and a stack (`stk`) to handle nested expressions.\n\n2. **Character Iteration**: The solution iterates through each character in the input string:\n   - If the character is a digit, it builds the current number by multiplying the existing number by 10 and adding the new digit.\n   - If the character is a '+' or '-', it updates the result with the current number multiplied by the current sign, resets the number, and updates the sign accordingly.\n   - If the character is '(', it pushes the current result and sign onto the stack and resets them for the new sub-expression.\n   - If the character is ')', it finalizes the current number, multiplies the result by the last sign from the stack, and adds the last result from the stack.\n\n3. **Finalization**: After the loop, if there is any remaining number, it adds it to the result.\n\n### Key Differences from My Approach:\n- **Stack Usage**: The official solution uses a single stack to manage both the result and the sign, which simplifies the handling of nested expressions.\n- **Direct Character Handling**: The official solution processes characters directly without needing to check for spaces or handle them separately, making the code cleaner.\n- **Efficiency**: The official solution efficiently updates the result and handles signs in a straightforward manner, reducing the complexity of managing multiple stacks.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe official solution is more concise and effective in handling the evaluation of expressions. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining a clear state with the use of a stack and direct character processing, which can be beneficial for similar problems in the future.",
    "desc": "\n[description]\nThis function evaluates a mathematical expression represented as a string, handling addition, subtraction, and parentheses. It uses two stacks: one for numbers and another for operators, processing each character in the string while ignoring spaces. When a digit is encountered, it builds the current number, and when an operator or parenthesis is found, it updates the stacks accordingly. It handles nested expressions by processing operators within parentheses and adjusting the number stack based on the last operator encountered. After iterating through the string, it processes any remaining operators and returns the final computed result as an integer. The function effectively manages operator precedence and ensures correct evaluation of the expression.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to evaluate mathematical expressions programmatically, such as in building calculators, parsing mathematical input in applications, or implementing features in programming languages that require expression evaluation. It can also be applied in educational tools that help users understand arithmetic operations and order of operations, as well as in developing compilers or interpreters that need to handle arithmetic expressions."
