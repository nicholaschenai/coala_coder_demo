These expressions can include numbers, addition and subtraction operations, parentheses for grouping, and spaces that should be ignored.

We will iterate through the characters in the string, keeping track of the current number and the current operation (addition or subtraction). When we encounter a number, we will build it up until we hit a non-digit character. When we hit an operator or a parenthesis, we will process the current number based on the last operation we saw.

The solution required careful traversal of the string, handling digits, brackets, and characters appropriately.\n\n    Key concepts included using a stack to manage nested structures and building the current number and string dynamically as we parsed the input. The approach effectively handled multiple digits and nested encodings by pushing the current state onto the stack when encountering an opening bracket and popping it when encountering a closing bracket.\n\n    The final implementation successfully decoded the string by iterating through each character, updating the current number and string, and utilizing the stack to manage the context of nested encodings. The code snippet provided was:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:\n            stack = []  # Initialize a stack to keep track of numbers and strings\n            current_num = 0  # To build the current number\n            current_string = \"\"  # To build the current decoded string\n\n            for char in s:  # Iterate through each character in the string\n                if char.isdigit():  # Check if the character is a digit\n                    current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)  # Build the number\n                elif char == '[':  # Check for opening bracket\n                    stack.append((current_string, current_num))  # Push current string and number onto stack\n                    current_string = \"\"  # Reset current string\n                    current_num = 0  # Reset current number\n                elif char == ']':  # Check for closing bracket\n                    last_string, num = stack.pop()  # Pop from stack\n                    current_string = last_string + current_string * num  # Repeat current string and append\n                else:  # If it's a regular character\n                    current_string += char  # Append the character to the current string\n\n            return current_string  # Return the fully decoded string\n    ```\n\n    The solution passed all tests, indicating that the approach was effective and correctly implemented. No unexpected errors were encountered during the process.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Expression parsing\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Expression parsing\n\n    A string containing a mathematical expression containing numbers and various operators is given.\n    We have to compute the value of it in $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string.\n\n    The algorithm discussed here translates an expression into the so-called **reverse Polish notation** (explicitly or implicitly), and evaluates this expression.\n\n    ## Reverse Polish notation\n\n    The reverse Polish notation is a form of writing mathematical expressions, in which the operators are located after their operands.\n    For example the following expression\n\n    $$a + b * c * d + (e - f) * (g * h + i)$$\n\n    can be written in reverse Polish notation in the following way:\n\n    $$a b c * d * + e f - g h * i + * +$$\n\n    The reverse Polish notation was developed by the Australian philosopher and computer science specialist Charles Hamblin in the mid 1950s on the basis of the Polish notation, which was proposed in 1920 by the Polish mathematician Jan \u0141ukasiewicz.\n\n    The convenience of the reverse Polish notation is, that expressions in this form are very **easy to evaluate** in linear time.\n    We use a stack, which is initially empty.\n    We will iterate over the operands and operators of the expression in reverse Polish notation.\n    If the current element is a number, then we put the value on top of the stack, if the current element is an operator, then we get the top two elements from the stack, perform the operation, and put the result back on top of the stack.\n    In the end there will be exactly one element left in the stack, which will be the value of the expression.\n\n    Obviously this simple evaluation runs in $O(n)$ time.\n\n    ## Parsing of simple expressions\n\n    For the time being we only consider a simplified problem:\n    we assume that all operators are **binary** (i.e. they take two arguments), and all are **left-associative** (if the priorities are equal, they get executed from left to right).\n    Parentheses are allowed.\n\n    We will set up two stacks: one for numbers, and one for operators and parentheses.\n    Initially both stacks are empty.\n    For the second stack we will maintain the condition that all operations are ordered by strict descending priority.\n    If there are parenthesis on the stack, than each block of operators (corresponding to one pair of parenthesis) is ordered, and the entire stack is not necessarily ordered.\n\n    We will iterate over the characters of the expression from left to right.\n    If the current character is a digit, then we put the value of this number on the stack.\n    If the current character is an opening parenthesis, then we put it on the stack.\n    If the current character is a closing parenthesis, the we execute all operators on the stack until we reach the opening bracket (in other words we perform all operations inside the parenthesis).\n    Finally if the current character is an operator, then while the top of the stack has an operator with the same or higher priority, we will execute this operation, and put the new operation on the stack.\n\n    After we processed the entire string, some operators might still be in the stack, so we execute them.\n\n    Here is the implementation of this method for the four operators $+$ $-$ $*$ $/$:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=expression_parsing_simple}\n    bool delim(char c) {\n        return c == ' ';\n    }\n\n    bool is_op(char c) {\n        return c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*' || c == '/';\n    }\n\n    int priority (char op) {\n        if (op == '+' || op == '-')\n            return 1;\n        if (op == '*' || op == '/')\n            return 2;\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    void process_op(stack<int>& st, char op) {\n        int r = st.top(); st.pop();\n        int l = st.top(); st.pop();\n        switch (op) {\n            case '+': st.push(l + r); break;\n            case '-': st.push(l - r); break;\n            case '*': st.push(l * r); break;\n            case '/': st.push(l / r); break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    int evaluate(string& s) {\n        stack<int> st;\n        stack<char> op;\n        for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); i++) {\n            if (delim(s[i]))\n                continue;\n        \n            if (s[i] == '(') {\n                op.push('(');\n            } else if (s[i] == ')') {\n                while (op.top() != '(') {\n                    process_op(st, op.top());\n                    op.pop();\n                }\n                op.pop();\n            } else if (is_op(s[i])) {\n                char cur_op = s[i];\n                while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) {\n                    process_op(st, op.top());\n                    op.pop();\n                }\n                op.push(cur_op);\n            } else {\n                int number = 0;\n                while (i < (int)s.size() && isalnum(s[i]))\n                    number = number * 10 + s[i++] - '0';\n                --i;\n                st.push(number);\n            }\n        }\n\n        while (!op.empty()) {\n            process_op(st, op.top());\n            op.pop();\n        }\n        return st.top();\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Thus we learned how to calculate the value of an expression in $O(n)$, at the same time we implicitly used the reverse Polish notation.\n    By slightly modifying the above implementation it is also possible to obtain the expression in reverse Polish notation in an explicit form.\n\n    ## Unary operators\n\n    Now suppose that the expression also contains **unary** operators (operators that take one argument).\n    The unary plus and unary minus are common examples of such operators.\n\n    One of the differences in this case, is that we need to determine whether the current operator is a unary or a binary one.\n\n    You can notice, that before an unary operator, there always is another operator or an opening parenthesis, or nothing at all (if it is at the very beginning of the expression).\n    On the contrary before a binary operator there will always be an operand (number) or a closing parenthesis.\n    Thus it is easy to flag whether the next operator can be unary or not. \n\n    Additionally we need to execute a unary and a binary operator differently.\n    And we need to chose the priority of a unary operator higher than all of the binary operators.\n\n    In addition it should be noted, that some unary operators (e.g. unary plus and unary minus) are actually **right-associative**.\n\n    ## Right-associativity\n\n    Right-associative means, that whenever the priorities are equal, the operators must be evaluated from right to left.\n\n    As noted above, unary operators are usually right-associative.\n    Another example for an right-associative operator is the exponentiation operator ($a \\wedge b \\wedge c$ is usually perceived as $a^{b^c}$ and not as $(a^b)^c$).\n\n    What difference do we need to make in order to correctly handle right-associative operators?\n    It turns out that the changes are very minimal.\n    The only difference will be, if the priorities are equal we will postpone the execution of the right-associative operation.\n\n    The only line that needs to be replaced is\n    ```cpp\n    while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op))\n    ```\n    with\n    ```cpp\n    while (!op.empty() && (\n            (left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) ||\n            (!left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) > priority(cur_op))\n        ))\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The code should evaluate the expression as soon as a closing parenthesis is encountered or when an operator is found.\n   - The logic for handling the last number and operator is flawed. The last number may not be pushed onto the stack if the expression ends with a number.\n   - The code does not account for spaces properly, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the expression.\n\nTo fix these issues, I will revise the code to ensure that:\n- Each number is processed correctly.\n- Operators are applied immediately when they are encountered.\n- Parentheses are handled properly by evaluating the expression within them.\n- Spaces are ignored during parsing.\n\nHere\u2019s the corrected version of the code:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:\n        # Initialize stacks for numbers and operators\n        num_stack = []\n        current_num = 0\n        last_op = '+'  # Default operator\n        s = s.replace(\" \", \"\")  # Remove spaces for easier processing\n        \n        # Iterate through each character in the string\n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            char = s[i]\n            \n            if char.isdigit():  # If the character is a digit\n                current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)  # Build the current number\n            \n            # If the character is an operator or we are at the end of the string\n            if char in \"+-()\" or i == len(s) - 1:\n                if last_op == '+':  # If the last operator was '+'\n                    num_stack.append(current_num)  # Push current number onto the stack\n                elif last_op == '-':  # If the last operator was '-'\n                    num_stack.append(-current_num)  # Push negative current number onto the stack\n                \n                if char == '(':  # If the character is an opening parenthesis\n                    num_stack.append(last_op)  # Push the last operator onto the number stack\n                \n                if char == ')':  # If the character is a closing parenthesis\n                    temp_sum = 0\n                    while isinstance(num_stack[-1], int):  # Process until we find the last operator\n                        temp_sum += num_stack.pop()  # Sum the numbers\n                    num_stack.pop()  # Remove the last operator\n                    num_stack.append(temp_sum)  # Push the result back onto the stack\n                \n                current_num = 0  # Reset current number\n                last_op = char  # Update last operator\n        \n        # Process any remaining operators in the stack\n        if last_op == '+':\n            num_stack.append(current_num)\n        elif last_op == '-':\n            num_stack.append(-current_num)\n        \n        return sum(num_stack)  # Return the sum of the numbers in the stack\n``` \n\nThis revised code should correctly evaluate the expressions as required."

The solution required careful traversal of the string, handling digits, brackets, and characters appropriately.\n\n    Key concepts included using a stack to manage nested structures and building the current number and string dynamically as we parsed the input. The approach effectively handled multiple digits and nested encodings by pushing the current state onto the stack when encountering an opening bracket and popping it when encountering a closing bracket.\n\n    The final implementation successfully decoded the string by iterating through each character, updating the current number and string, and utilizing the stack to manage the context of nested encodings. The code snippet provided was:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:\n            stack = []  # Initialize a stack to keep track of numbers and strings\n            current_num = 0  # To build the current number\n            current_string = \"\"  # To build the current decoded string\n\n            for char in s:  # Iterate through each character in the string\n                if char.isdigit():  # Check if the character is a digit\n                    current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)  # Build the number\n                elif char == '[':  # Check for opening bracket\n                    stack.append((current_string, current_num))  # Push current string and number onto stack\n                    current_string = \"\"  # Reset current string\n                    current_num = 0  # Reset current number\n                elif char == ']':  # Check for closing bracket\n                    last_string, num = stack.pop()  # Pop from stack\n                    current_string = last_string + current_string * num  # Repeat current string and append\n                else:  # If it's a regular character\n                    current_string += char  # Append the character to the current string\n\n            return current_string  # Return the fully decoded string\n    ```\n\n    The solution passed all tests, indicating that the approach was effective and correctly implemented.

st.pop();\n        int l = st.top(); st.pop();\n        switch (op) {\n            case '+': st.push(l + r); break;\n            case '-': st.push(l - r); break;\n            case '*': st.push(l * r); break;\n            case '/': st.push(l / r); break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    int evaluate(string& s) {\n        stack<int> st;\n        stack<char> op;\n        for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); i++) {\n            if (delim(s[i]))\n                continue;\n        \n            if (s[i] == '(') {\n                op.push('(');\n            } else if (s[i] == ')') {\n                while (op.top() != '(') {\n                    process_op(st, op.top());\n                    op.pop();\n                }\n                op.pop();\n            } else if (is_op(s[i])) {\n                char cur_op = s[i];\n                while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) {\n                    process_op(st, op.top());\n                    op.pop();\n                }\n                op.push(cur_op);\n            } else {\n                int number = 0;\n                while (i < (int)s.size() && isalnum(s[i]))\n                    number = number * 10 + s[i++] - '0';\n                --i;\n                st.push(number);\n            }\n        }\n\n        while (!op.empty()) {\n            process_op(st, op.top());\n            op.pop();\n        }\n        return st.top();\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Thus we learned how to calculate the value of an expression in $O(n)$, at the same time we implicitly used the reverse Polish notation.\n    By slightly modifying the above implementation it is also possible to obtain the expression in reverse Polish notation in an explicit form.\n\n    ## Unary operators\n\n    Now suppose that the expression also contains **unary** operators (operators that take one argument).\n    The unary plus and unary minus are common examples of such operators.\n\n    One of the differences in this case, is that we need to determine whether the current operator is a unary or a binary one.\n\n    You can notice, that before an unary operator, there always is another operator or an opening parenthesis, or nothing at all (if it is at the very beginning of the expression).\n    On the contrary before a binary operator there will always be an operand (number) or a closing parenthesis.\n    Thus it is easy to flag whether the next operator can be unary or not. \n\n    Additionally we need to execute a unary and a binary operator differently.\n    And we need to chose the priority of a unary operator higher than all of the binary operators.\n\n    In addition it should be noted, that some unary operators (e.g. unary plus and unary minus) are actually **right-associative**.\n\n    ## Right-associativity\n\n    Right-associative means, that whenever the priorities are equal, the operators must be evaluated from right to left.\n\n    As noted above, unary operators are usually right-associative.\n    Another example for an right-associative operator is the exponentiation operator ($a \\wedge b \\wedge c$ is usually perceived as $a^{b^c}$ and not as $(a^b)^c$).\n\n    What difference do we need to make in order to correctly handle right-associative operators?\n    It turns out that the changes are very minimal.\n    The only difference will be, if the priorities are equal we will postpone the execution of the right-associative operation.\n\n    The only line that needs to be replaced is\n    ```cpp\n    while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op))\n    ```\n    with\n    ```cpp\n    while (!op.empty() && (\n            (left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) ||\n            (!left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) > priority(cur_op))\n        ))\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

        "content": "The official solution provides a clear and efficient approach to evaluating a mathematical expression with support for addition, subtraction, and parentheses. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that can be useful for future reference:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The solution initializes variables for the result (`res`), the current number (`num`), the current sign (`sign`), and a stack (`stk`) to handle nested expressions.\n\n2. **Character Iteration**: The solution iterates through each character in the input string:\n   - If the character is a digit, it builds the current number by multiplying the existing number by 10 and adding the new digit.\n   - If the character is a '+' or '-', it updates the result with the current number multiplied by the current sign, resets the number, and updates the sign accordingly.\n   - If the character is '(', it pushes the current result and sign onto the stack and resets them for the new sub-expression.\n   - If the character is ')', it finalizes the current number, multiplies the result by the last sign from the stack, and adds the last result from the stack.\n\n3. **Finalization**: After the loop, if there is any remaining number, it adds it to the result.\n\n### Key Differences from My Approach:\n- **Stack Usage**: The official solution uses a single stack to manage both the result and the sign, which simplifies the handling of nested expressions.\n- **Direct Character Handling**: The official solution processes characters directly without needing to check for spaces or handle them separately, making the code cleaner.\n- **Efficiency**: The official solution efficiently updates the result and handles signs in a straightforward manner, reducing the complexity of managing multiple stacks.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe official solution is more concise and effective in handling the evaluation of expressions. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining a clear state with the use of a stack and direct character processing, which can be beneficial for similar problems in the future."

        "content": "\n[description]\nThis function evaluates a mathematical expression represented as a string, handling addition, subtraction, and parentheses. It uses two stacks: one for numbers and another for operators, processing each character in the string while ignoring spaces. When a digit is encountered, it builds the current number, and when an operator or parenthesis is found, it updates the stacks accordingly. It handles nested expressions by processing operators within parentheses and adjusting the number stack based on the last operator encountered. After iterating through the string, it processes any remaining operators and returns the final computed result as an integer. The function effectively manages operator precedence and ensures correct evaluation of the expression.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to evaluate mathematical expressions programmatically, such as in building calculators, parsing mathematical input in applications, or implementing features in programming languages that require expression evaluation. It can also be applied in educational tools that help users understand arithmetic operations and order of operations, as well as in developing compilers or interpreters that need to handle arithmetic expressions."
