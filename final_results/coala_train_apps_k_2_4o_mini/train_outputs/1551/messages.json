Now, he is interested in classifying all the fancy quotes he knows. He thinks that all fancy quotes which contain the word \"not\" are Real Fancy; quotes that do not contain it are regularly fancy.\nYou are given some quotes. For each quote, you need to tell Chef if it is Real Fancy or just regularly fancy.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$ denoting a quote.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string \"Real Fancy\" or \"regularly fancy\" (without quotes).\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 50$\n- $1 \\le |S| \\le 100$\n- each character of $S$ is either a lowercase English letter or a space\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\n\n-----Example Input-----\n2\ni do not have any fancy quotes\nwhen nothing goes right go left\n\n-----Example Output-----\nReal Fancy\nregularly fancy\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1: \"i do not have any fancy quotes\"\nExample case 2: The word \"not\" does not appear in the given quote.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The key insight was recognizing the impact of the parity of \\( N \\) on the game's outcome. If \\( N \\) is 1, the first player loses immediately. If \\( N \\) is even, the Grinch can always respond in a way that keeps him in a winning position. Conversely, if \\( N \\) is odd, the first player can make it even for the Grinch, leading to a win for the first player.\n\n    The solution involved a simple function that checks the value of \\( N \\) and returns the winner based on these conditions. The implementation was straightforward, and the logic was sound, leading to successful test cases.\n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def determine_winner(N):\n        if N == 1:\n            return \"Grinch\"\n        if N % 2 == 0:\n            return \"Grinch\"\n        else:\n            return \"Me\"\n\n    T = int(input())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        result = determine_winner(N)\n        print(result)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of analyzing game theory problems through the lens of parity and strategic moves, which can simplify the decision-making process significantly.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to determine if there are two zebras in a jungle that spit at each other based on their positions and spit distances. The solution involved using a dictionary to map each zebra's position to the position it spits to. The core concept was to check for reciprocal spitting, meaning if zebra A spits to zebra B, then zebra B must spit back to zebra A.\n\n    The approach was straightforward: read the input data, store the positions and their target spit positions in a dictionary, and then check for each zebra if its target position exists in the dictionary and if it spits back to the original position. This method efficiently checks for the required condition in linear time.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test case. The code snippet used is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_spitting_zebras(t):\n        positions = {}\n        for _ in range(t):\n            a, b = map(int, input().split())\n            target_position = a + b\n            positions[a] = target_position\n    \n        for a in positions:\n            target = positions[a]\n            if target in positions and positions[target] == a:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                return\n    \n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    t = int(input())\n    find_spitting_zebras(t)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of using data structures like dictionaries for efficient lookups and the value of clearly defining the problem's requirements before diving into coding.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

It reads the number of test cases and processes each quote by splitting it into words. The use of the `in` operator to check for \"not\" in the list of words is efficient and clear.\n\nOne key insight from the official solution is the use of `list(input().split(' '))`, which directly splits the input string into words, making it easy to check for \"not\". This is similar to my approach, where I also split the quote into words, but the official solution's use of a while loop to manage the number of test cases is a bit more concise.\n\nAnother point of reflection is that the official solution does not require the additional list to store quotes before processing them, which simplifies the code. Instead, it processes each quote immediately after reading it, which can be more memory efficient.\n\nOverall, the official solution is effective and concise, and it reinforces the importance of directly processing input in a streamlined manner. In future problems, I should consider minimizing the use of intermediate data structures unless necessary."
