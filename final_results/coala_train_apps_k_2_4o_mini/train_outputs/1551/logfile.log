INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem requires us to classify quotes based on the presence of the word "not". If a quote contains the word "not", it is classified as "Real Fancy". If it does not contain the word "not", it is classified as "regularly fancy". We need to process multiple quotes as input and provide the classification for each.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   We will read the number of quotes (test cases) and then for each quote, we will check if the word "not" is present. To do this, we can split the quote into words and check if "not" is one of those words. Based on this check, we will print "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Read the integer T (number of test cases)
   For each test case from 1 to T:
       Read the quote S
       Split S into words
       If "not" is in the list of words:
           Print "Real Fancy"
       Else:
           Print "regularly fancy"
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
# Function to classify quotes as Real Fancy or regularly fancy

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    
    # Iterate over each test case

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine the winner of a game played between two players based on the integer \( N \). The key insight was recognizing the impact of the parity of \( N \) on the game's outcome. If \( N \) is 1, the first player loses immediately. If \( N \) is even, the Grinch can always respond in a way that keeps him in a winning position. Conversely, if \( N \) is odd, the first player can make it even for the Grinch, leading to a win for the first player.

    The solution involved a simple function that checks the value of \( N \) and returns the winner based on these conditions. The implementation was straightforward, and the logic was sound, leading to successful test cases.

    The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def determine_winner(N):
        if N == 1:
            return "Grinch"
        if N % 2 == 0:
            return "Grinch"
        else:
            return "Me"

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        result = determine_winner(N)
        print(result)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of analyzing game theory problems through the lens of parity and strategic moves, which can simplify the decision-making process significantly.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine if there are two zebras in a jungle that spit at each other based on their positions and spit distances. The solution involved using a dictionary to map each zebra's position to the position it spits to. The core concept was to check for reciprocal spitting, meaning if zebra A spits to zebra B, then zebra B must spit back to zebra A.

    The approach was straightforward: read the input data, store the positions and their target spit positions in a dictionary, and then check for each zebra if its target position exists in the dictionary and if it spits back to the original position. This method efficiently checks for the required condition in linear time.

    The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test case. The code snippet used is as follows:

    ```python
    def find_spitting_zebras(t):
        positions = {}
        for _ in range(t):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            target_position = a + b
            positions[a] = target_position
    
        for a in positions:
            target = positions[a]
            if target in positions and positions[target] == a:
                print("YES")
                return
    
        print("NO")

    t = int(input())
    find_spitting_zebras(t)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of using data structures like dictionaries for efficient lookups and the value of clearly defining the problem's requirements before diving into coding.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to classify quotes based on the presence of the word "not". The solution involved reading multiple quotes and determining if each quote contained the word "not" as a standalone word. If it did, the quote was classified as "Real Fancy"; otherwise, it was classified as "regularly fancy".

The approach taken was straightforward: read the number of test cases, iterate through each quote, split the quote into words, and check for the presence of "not". This method effectively utilized basic string manipulation and list operations.

The final implementation was as follows:

```python
def classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    for quote in quotes:
        words = quote.split()
        if "not" in words:
            print("Real Fancy")
        else:
            print("regularly fancy")

T = int(input())
quotes = []
for _ in range(T):
    quotes.append(input())

classify_quotes(T, quotes)
```

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
"I don't have any fancy quotes." - vijju123
Chef was reading some quotes by great people. Now, he is interested in classifying all the fancy quotes he knows. He thinks that all fancy quotes which contain the word "not" are Real Fancy; quotes that do not contain it are regularly fancy.
You are given some quotes. For each quote, you need to tell Chef if it is Real Fancy or just regularly fancy.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$ denoting a quote.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy" (without quotes).

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 50$
- $1 \le |S| \le 100$
- each character of $S$ is either a lowercase English letter or a space

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
2
i do not have any fancy quotes
when nothing goes right go left

-----Example Output-----
Real Fancy
regularly fancy

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: "i do not have any fancy quotes"
Example case 2: The word "not" does not appear in the given quote.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to classify quotes based on whether they contain the word "not". If a quote contains "not", it is classified as "Real Fancy". If it does not contain "not", it is classified as "regularly fancy". We need to process multiple quotes and provide the classification for each.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   We will read the number of quotes (test cases) and then for each quote, we will check if the word "not" is present. This can be done by splitting the quote into words and checking if "not" is one of those words. Based on this check, we will print either "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Read the integer T (number of test cases)
   For each test case from 1 to T:
       Read the quote S
       Split S into words
       If "not" is in the list of words:
           Print "Real Fancy"
       Else:
           Print "regularly fancy"
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    # Iterate over each quote
    for quote in quotes:
        # Split the quote into words
        words = quote.split()
        # Check if "not" is in the list of words
        if "not" in words:
            print("Real Fancy")
        else:
            print("regularly fancy")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
quotes = []
# Read each quote
for _ in range(T):
    quotes.append(input())

# Classify the quotes
classify_quotes(T, quotes)

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
# cook your dish here
import re
t=int(input())
while(t>0):
 s=list(input().split(' '))
 if("not" in s):
  print("Real Fancy")
 else:
  print("regularly fancy")
 t=t-1

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem by using a straightforward approach to check for the presence of the word "not" in each quote. It reads the number of test cases and processes each quote by splitting it into words. The use of the `in` operator to check for "not" in the list of words is efficient and clear.

One key insight from the official solution is the use of `list(input().split(' '))`, which directly splits the input string into words, making it easy to check for "not". This is similar to my approach, where I also split the quote into words, but the official solution's use of a while loop to manage the number of test cases is a bit more concise.

Another point of reflection is that the official solution does not require the additional list to store quotes before processing them, which simplifies the code. Instead, it processes each quote immediately after reading it, which can be more memory efficient.

Overall, the official solution is effective and concise, and it reinforces the importance of directly processing input in a streamlined manner. In future problems, I should consider minimizing the use of intermediate data structures unless necessary.

The main function is `classify_quotes`.
INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] This function takes a number of quotes and classifies each one based on the presence of the word "not." It iterates through the list of quotes, splitting each quote into individual words. If the word "not" is found in a quote, it prints "Real Fancy"; otherwise, it prints "regularly fancy." The classification is done in a straightforward manner, focusing solely on the presence of the specific word. The function effectively distinguishes between two categories of quotes based on this simple criterion. Overall, it provides a basic mechanism for quote classification.
