    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to help Avani calculate the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries. Each query specifies a range of indices, and we need to return the sum of the values in that range for each query.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - First, read the number of test cases.\n   - For each test case, read the number of bills and the number of queries.\n   - Store the values of the bills in a list.\n   - For each query, calculate the sum of the bills from the specified start index to the end index (both inclusive).\n   - Print the results for each query.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function process_queries(T):\n       for each test case in T:\n           read N and Q\n           read the list of bills\n           for each query in Q:\n               read X and Y\n               calculate the sum of bills from index X-1 to Y-1\n               store the result\n       print all results\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef process_queries(T):\n    for _ in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case\n        N, Q = map(int, input().split())  # Read number of bills and queries\n        bills = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the list of bills\n        \n        for __ in range(Q):  # Iterate over each query\n            X, Y = map(int, input().split())  # Read the query indices\n            # Calculate the sum from index X-1 to Y-1 (inclusive)\n            total_sum = sum(bills[X-1:Y])  \n            print(total_sum)  # Output the result for the query\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nprocess_queries(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases\n```",
