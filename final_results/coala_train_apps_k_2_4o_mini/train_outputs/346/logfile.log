INFO - [Task id] 346 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the number of continuous subarrays within a given list of integers that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We will maintain a count of odd numbers in the current window (subarray). We will expand the window by moving the right pointer and include new elements. If the count of odd numbers exceeds `k`, we will move the left pointer to reduce the count. We will also keep track of how many times we have seen subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers by using a helper function to count subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function countAtMostK(nums, k):
       Initialize count = 0
       Initialize left = 0
       Initialize odd_count = 0
       for right from 0 to length of nums:
           if nums[right] is odd:
               increment odd_count
           while odd_count > k:
               if nums[left] is odd:
                   decrement odd_count
               increment left
           count += (right - left + 1)

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
           We need to find the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} such that a specific number I appears at the K-th position in the sorted order of the subset. We will handle multiple queries for each test case, and the results should be printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
           To solve this problem, we need to understand how to count the valid subsets:
           - For a number I to be at the K-th position in a subset, there must be exactly K-1 numbers that are less than I in the subset.
           - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than I.
           - We can use combinatorial counting to determine how many ways we can choose K-1 numbers from the numbers less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I.
           - The total number of valid subsets can be calculated using combinations and powers of 2.

[Summary]:
    The problem involved calculating the number of unique results from the bitwise OR of all contiguous subarrays of a given array of non-negative integers. The key insight was that the bitwise OR operation accumulates values, allowing us to build upon previous results without recomputing from scratch.

    The solution utilized a set to store unique results and a list to track current OR results as we iterated through the array. For each element, we computed the new OR values based on the previous results and added them to the set for uniqueness. This approach effectively handled the constraints of the problem, ensuring that we could manage up to 50,000 elements efficiently.

    The final implementation was straightforward and passed the provided test cases, confirming its correctness. The code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: list[int]) -> int:
            unique_results = set()
            current_results = []
        
            for num in A:
                new_results = []
                for result in current_results:
                    new_or = result | num
                    new_results.append(new_or)
                    unique_results.add(new_or)
                new_results.append(num)
                unique_results.add(num)
                current_results = new_results
        
            return len(unique_results)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding bitwise operations and their properties, particularly in the context of accumulating results over iterations.

INFO - [Task id] 346 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the number of continuous subarrays from a given array of integers that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. A subarray is defined as a contiguous part of the array.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach to count the number of odd numbers in the subarrays. We will maintain two pointers to represent the start and end of the current subarray. As we expand the end pointer, we will count the odd numbers. When the count of odd numbers exceeds `k`, we will move the start pointer to reduce the count. We will also keep track of how many valid subarrays we can form when we have exactly `k` odd numbers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function numberOfNiceSubarrays(nums, k):
       count = 0
       left = 0
       odd_count = 0
       total_nice_subarrays = 0
       
       for right in range(len(nums)):
           if nums[right] is odd:
               odd_count += 1

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the number of continuous subarrays from a given array of integers that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. A subarray is defined as a contiguous part of the array.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach to count the number of odd numbers in the subarrays. We will maintain two pointers to represent the start and end of the current subarray. As we expand the end pointer, we will count the odd numbers. When the count of odd numbers exceeds `k`, we will move the start pointer to reduce the count. We will also keep track of how many valid subarrays we can form when we have exactly `k` odd numbers.

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 346 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to count the number of continuous subarrays that contain exactly `k` odd numbers from a given list of integers. The solution utilized a sliding window approach, which is effective for problems involving contiguous subarrays. 

The core concept involved maintaining two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the current subarray. As the `right` pointer expanded to include more elements, we counted the odd numbers. If the count exceeded `k`, we moved the `left` pointer to reduce the count. When the count matched `k`, we calculated how many valid subarrays could be formed by counting the even numbers to the left of the `left` pointer.

The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test cases. The key strategies that worked included efficiently managing the count of odd numbers and leveraging the properties of even numbers to determine the number of valid subarrays. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed well within the constraints. 

The final code snippet is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        left = 0
        odd_count = 0
        total_nice_subarrays = 0
        
        for right in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[right] % 2 == 1:
                odd_count += 1
            
            while odd_count > k:
                if nums[left] % 2 == 1:
                    odd_count -= 1
                left += 1
            
            if odd_count == k:
                temp_left = left
                while temp_left < right and nums[temp_left] % 2 == 0:
                    temp_left += 1
                count_left = temp_left - left + 1
                total_nice_subarrays += count_left
        
        return total_nice_subarrays
``` 

This experience reinforced the effectiveness of the sliding window technique for problems involving subarrays and counting specific conditions.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

    def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # save all even subarray's length which between odds
        edge = []
        res = 0
        count = 0
        for i in nums:
            # odd
            if i % 2:
                # +1 because range from 0 to count when doing combination
                edge.append(count+1)
                count = 0
            # even
            else:
                count += 1
        edge.append(count+1)
        # no enough odd
        if len(edge)-1 < k:
            return 0
        else:
            # combination
            for i in range(len(edge)-k):
                res += edge[i] * edge[i+k]
            return res

INFO - [Task id] 346 [generation text] The official solution employs a more efficient approach by focusing on the lengths of even subarrays that are situated between odd numbers. This method effectively reduces the problem to counting combinations of these lengths, which is a significant improvement over the sliding window technique I initially used.

Key insights from the official solution:

1. **Edge Array**: The solution constructs an `edge` array that stores the lengths of even subarrays found between odd numbers. This allows for a clear representation of how many even numbers can be included in the subarrays that contain exactly `k` odd numbers.

2. **Combination Calculation**: Instead of iterating through all possible subarrays, the solution calculates the number of valid combinations of even lengths that can be formed with the odd numbers. This is done by multiplying the lengths of the even segments before and after the `k` odd numbers.

3. **Efficiency**: The official solution runs in linear time, O(n), as it only requires a single pass to build the `edge` array and another pass to compute the result. This is more efficient than the nested loops that would be required in a naive approach.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution checks if there are enough odd numbers to form a valid subarray before proceeding with the combination calculations, which prevents unnecessary computations.

Overall, the official solution is a great example of how to simplify a problem by breaking it down into manageable parts and leveraging combinatorial logic, which I can apply in future problems involving counting subarrays or combinations.

INFO - [Task id] 346 [generation text] This function calculates the number of contiguous subarrays within a given list of integers that contain exactly a specified number of odd integers. It uses a sliding window approach, maintaining a count of odd numbers as it iterates through the list. When the count of odd numbers exceeds the specified limit, it adjusts the left boundary of the window. If the count matches the limit, it counts the number of valid subarrays by considering the even numbers that can be included on the left side. The total count of such subarrays is accumulated and returned at the end. This approach efficiently finds the desired subarrays without needing to check every possible combination explicitly.
