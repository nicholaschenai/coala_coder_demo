    "summary": "### Summary of Attempts\n\nThe problem involved finding a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the function \\( f(P) \\), defined as the sum of the maximums of adjacent pairs, equals a given value K. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a permutation of size N is calculated as \\( (N-1) * N / 2 \\). \n\nIn my initial attempts, I correctly identified the maximum value and the need to adjust a descending permutation to reach K. However, the logic for adjusting the permutation was flawed. I attempted to swap adjacent elements to decrease the sum, but I did not properly account for how these swaps would affect the maximums of adjacent pairs. This led to incorrect outputs, particularly returning -1 for cases where valid permutations existed.\n\nThe key insight is that to achieve a specific K, we need to start with the maximum sum and then reduce it by making specific swaps. The approach should involve systematically adjusting the permutation while ensuring that the resulting sum matches K.\n\n### Key Code Snippet\nThe following code snippet outlines the structure of the solution, which needs to be revised to correctly adjust the permutation:\n\n```python\ndef find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N, K = case\n        max_value = (N - 1) * N // 2\n        \n        if K < 0 or K > max_value:\n            results.append(-1)\n            continue\n        \n        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n        current_sum = max_value\n        \n        # Logic to adjust the permutation to match K needs to be revised\n        # ...\n        \n    print(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)))\n```\n\n### Lessons Learned\n1. **Understanding Function Behavior:** It's crucial to fully understand how the function behaves with different permutations and how adjacent swaps affect the overall sum.\n2. **Systematic Adjustment:** A more systematic approach to adjusting the permutation is necessary, potentially involving more than just adjacent swaps.\n3. **Testing Edge Cases:** Testing with various edge cases is essential to ensure the solution is robust and handles all scenarios correctly. \n\nFuture attempts should focus on refining the logic for adjusting the permutation and ensuring that the output matches the expected results for all test cases.",
    "reflection": "In my attempts to solve the problem of finding a permutation \\( P \\) such that the function \\( f(P) \\) equals a given value \\( K \\), I encountered several challenges that ultimately led to incorrect outputs. The primary issues stemmed from a misunderstanding of how to manipulate the permutation to achieve the desired sum of maximums of adjacent pairs.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n1. **Understanding the Bounds for \\( K \\):** The official solution effectively checks if \\( K \\) is within the valid range based on the maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\). For even \\( N \\), the bounds are derived from the maximum possible sums, which are calculated using the formula \\( (n*(n+1))//2 - 1 \\) and \\( 3*((n//2)**2) - 1 \\). This ensures that any \\( K \\) outside these bounds is immediately deemed impossible.\n\n2. **Constructing the Permutation:** The official solution uses a systematic approach to construct the permutation based on the value of \\( K \\). It adjusts the permutation by calculating how many elements need to be swapped or rearranged to achieve the desired sum. This involves:\n   - Starting with a base permutation.\n   - Adjusting the permutation based on the difference between the current sum and \\( K \\).\n   - Using a loop to fill in the permutation while ensuring that the maximums of adjacent pairs are correctly accounted for.\n\n3. **Handling Edge Cases:** The solution also effectively handles edge cases, such as when \\( N = 1 \\) and \\( K = 0 \\), ensuring that the output is correct for all possible inputs.\n\n### Reflection on My Approach:\nMy initial approach failed primarily due to:\n- **Incorrect Logic for Adjusting the Permutation:** I attempted to adjust the permutation by swapping adjacent elements without a clear strategy for how these swaps would affect the overall sum of maximums. The official solution's method of systematically calculating the necessary adjustments is more effective.\n- **Lack of Comprehensive Bound Checks:** While I checked if \\( K \\) was within a general range, I did not account for the specific conditions that the official solution checks, which are crucial for determining the feasibility of constructing a valid permutation.\n\nIn summary, the official solution provides a more structured and mathematically sound approach to solving the problem, particularly in how it calculates bounds and constructs the permutation. This experience highlights the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem constraints and systematically approaching the construction of solutions.",
