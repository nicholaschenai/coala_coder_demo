## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared $p$ different sets of questions (numbered $0$ through $p-1$), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:
- The students are assigned roll numbers â€” pairwise distinct positive integers.
- If a student's roll number is $r$, this student gets the $((r-1)\%p)$-th set of questions.
Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.
You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: $A$ and $B$ respectively. Find the number of values of $p$ for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line â€” the number of values of $p$ for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le A, B \le 10^8$

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Ram and Shyam have distinct roll numbers, and they receive different sets of questions based on their roll numbers. We need to determine how many different values of `p` (the number of question sets) allow them to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the values of `p` for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, we need to check when the modulo operation on their roll numbers results in the same value. This can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   (A - 1) \% p = (B - 1) \% p
   \]
   This can be simplified to:
   \[
   (A - B) \% p = 0
   \]
   This means that `p` must be a divisor of the absolute difference between `A` and `B`. If `A` equals `B`, they will always receive the same set of questions for any positive `p`, leading to an infinite number of values. If `A` is not equal to `B`, we can find the number of divisors of the absolute difference.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_divisors(n):
       count = 0
       for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
           if n % i == 0:
               count += 1

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host given the number of problems created by his setters, the number of problems required for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the number of days available to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for summation and list handling.

    The final implementation successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code was structured to first read input values, process each test case, and then output the results. Key strategies included using integer division to determine the number of contests and the `min` function to ensure the result did not exceed the available days. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of clear problem breakdown and efficient use of built-in functions in Python. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]
            A = case[3]
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))

    max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases)
    ```
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element `A[i]` by its index `i` any number of times. The key concepts involved were understanding the operations allowed and calculating the total sum of the sequence and the maximum possible reduction.

    Initially, the logic incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it would always be possible to make the sequence good. This led to incorrect outputs, especially when the total sum was negative. The correct approach involved checking if the total sum was negative (in which case it was impossible to make it zero) and ensuring that if the total sum was positive, it could be reduced to zero using the maximum reduction available.

    The final solution correctly implemented these checks:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            A = case[1]
            total_sum = sum(A)
            max_reduction = sum(i for i in range(1, N + 1))
        
            if total_sum < 0:
                print("NO")
            elif total_sum <= max_reduction:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering edge cases and the implications of the operations allowed on the sequence. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming the correctness of the logic.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Ram and Shyam have distinct roll numbers, and they receive exam question sets based on their roll numbers. The question set they receive is determined by the formula `((roll_number - 1) % p)`, where `p` is the total number of different question sets. We need to find out how many values of `p` allow both Ram and Shyam to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To determine the values of `p` for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, we need to ensure that the results of the modulo operation for both their roll numbers are equal. This means we need to find values of `p` such that:
   ```
   (A - 1) % p == (B - 1) % p
   ```
   This can be simplified to:
   ```
   (A - B) % p == 0
   ```
   This indicates that `p` must be a divisor of the absolute difference between their roll numbers, `|A - B|`. If `A` equals `B`, then they will always receive the same set for any positive `p`, leading to an infinite number of valid `p` values. If `A` is not equal to `B`, we can count the number of divisors of `|A - B|` to find the valid values of `p`.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared $p$ different sets of questions (numbered $0$ through $p-1$), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:
- The students are assigned roll numbers â€” pairwise distinct positive integers.
- If a student's roll number is $r$, this student gets the $((r-1)\%p)$-th set of questions.
Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.
You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: $A$ and $B$ respectively. Find the number of values of $p$ for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values.

- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line â€” the number of values of $p$ for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 100$

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Ram and Shyam have distinct roll numbers, and they receive exam question sets based on their roll numbers. The question set they receive is determined by the formula `((roll_number - 1) % p)`, where `p` is the total number of different question sets. We need to find out how many values of `p` allow both Ram and Shyam to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To determine the values of `p` for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, we need to ensure that the results of the modulo operation for both their roll numbers are equal. This means we need to find values of `p` such that:
   ```
   (A - 1) % p == (B - 1) % p
   ```
   This can be simplified to:
   ```
   (A - B) % p == 0
   ```
   This indicates that `p` must be a divisor of the absolute difference between their roll numbers, `|A - B|`. If `A` equals `B`, then they will always receive the same set for any positive `p`, leading to an infinite number of valid `p` values. If `A` is not equal to `B`, we can count the number of divisors of `|A - B|` to find the valid values of `p`.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] In this problem, the main task was to determine how many values of `p` allow two students, Ram and Shyam, to receive the same set of exam questions based on their roll numbers. The key insight was recognizing that the condition for them to receive the same set translates to finding the divisors of the absolute difference between their roll numbers.

The solution involved two main functions: one to count the divisors of a number and another to process multiple test cases. The divisor counting function iterated through potential divisors up to the square root of the number, which is an efficient approach. If the roll numbers were equal, it was straightforward to return -1, indicating an infinite number of valid `p` values.

The final implementation was straightforward and passed the provided test cases successfully. The core concepts involved understanding modular arithmetic and divisor counting, which are common in competitive programming problems. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and leveraging mathematical properties for efficient solutions.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.

- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:

    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
# cook your dish here
for test in range(0,int(input())):
 A,B = map(int,input().split())
 diff = abs(A-B)
 count=0
 if not(A^B):
  print(-1)
 else:

   if diff%i==0:
    if diff/i==i:
     count+=1 
    else:
     count+=2
  print(count)

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem by leveraging the properties of divisors and bitwise operations. Here are the key insights:

1. **Bitwise Comparison for Equality**: The official solution uses the expression `if not(A^B)` to check if `A` and `B` are equal. This is a clever use of the XOR operator, which returns 0 when both numbers are the same. This approach is efficient and concise compared to a direct equality check.

2. **Divisor Counting**: The solution counts the divisors of the absolute difference between `A` and `B` using a loop that runs up to the square root of the difference. This is optimal because divisors come in pairs, and checking up to the square root reduces the number of iterations significantly.

3. **Handling Perfect Squares**: The solution correctly accounts for perfect squares by checking if `diff/i == i` to avoid double counting the square root.

4. **Output**: The solution prints `-1` for infinite values of `p` when `A` equals `B`, and otherwise prints the count of valid `p` values.

Overall, the official solution is efficient and straightforward, effectively using bitwise operations and mathematical properties to solve the problem. My initial approach was similar but could have been improved by using the XOR operator for equality checks and ensuring clarity in the divisor counting logic.
