We need to determine how many different values of `p` (the number of question sets) allow them to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return -1.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To find the values of `p` for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, we need to check when the modulo operation on their roll numbers results in the same value.

The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the number of days available to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for summation and list handling.\n\n    The final implementation successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The code was structured to first read input values, process each test case, and then output the results. Key strategies included using integer division to determine the number of contests and the `min` function to ensure the result did not exceed the available days. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of clear problem breakdown and efficient use of built-in functions in Python. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n            A = case[3]\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))\n\n    max_division_3_contests(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element `A[i]` by its index `i` any number of times. The key concepts involved were understanding the operations allowed and calculating the total sum of the sequence and the maximum possible reduction.\n\n    Initially, the logic incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it would always be possible to make the sequence good. This led to incorrect outputs, especially when the total sum was negative. The correct approach involved checking if the total sum was negative (in which case it was impossible to make it zero) and ensuring that if the total sum was positive, it could be reduced to zero using the maximum reduction available.\n\n    The final solution correctly implemented these checks:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            A = case[1]\n            total_sum = sum(A)\n            max_reduction = sum(i for i in range(1, N + 1))\n        \n            if total_sum < 0:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            elif total_sum <= max_reduction:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering edge cases and the implications of the operations allowed on the sequence. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming the correctness of the logic.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
