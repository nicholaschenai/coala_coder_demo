## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Today, Chef has a fencing job at hand and has to fence up a surface covering N$N$ points. 
To minimize his work, he started looking for an algorithm that had him fence the least amount of length. 
He came up with the Convex Hull algorithm, but soon realized it gave him some random shape to fence. However, Chef likes rectangles and has a favourite number M$M$. 
Help him find the minimum perimeter he has to fence if he wants to fence a rectangle, with slope of one of the sides as M$M$, to cover all the points.

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains two integers N$N$ and M$M$, the number of points and the Chef's favourite Number.
- The next n lines contain two space separated integers X$X$ and Y$Y$, the coordinates of the point.

-----Output:-----
Print a single decimal number, denoting the perimeter of the rectangle. Answer will considered correct if it has absolute error less than 10âˆ’6$10^{-6}$.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef needs to fence a rectangular area that covers a set of points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides aligned with a slope defined by a given number M. The goal is to calculate the minimum perimeter of this rectangle.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the minimum perimeter of the rectangle, we need to:
   - Rotate the coordinate system based on the slope M to align one side of the rectangle with this slope.
   - Determine the minimum and maximum coordinates of the points in this rotated system.
   - Calculate the width and height of the rectangle using these coordinates.
   - Finally, compute the perimeter using the formula: Perimeter = 2 * (width + height).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function calculate_perimeter(N, M, points):
       # Step 1: Prepare to store transformed points
       transformed_points = []

       # Step 2: Rotate points based on slope M
       for each point (x, y) in points:
           new_x = x - M * y
           new_y = M * x + y
           transformed_points.append((new_x, new_y))

       # Step 3: Find min and max of transformed points

       max_y = max(transformed_points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]

       # Step 4: Calculate width and height
       width = max_x - min_x
       height = max_y - min_y

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine how many walls he needs to break to reach Dr. Doof, based on given wall positions and Chef's starting coordinates. The problem involved checking if Chef's position was on any wall and counting how many walls were above his maximum coordinate.

    The core concept involved understanding the geometric representation of walls as line segments and how to efficiently determine the number of walls Chef would need to break through. The solution utilized a straightforward approach of iterating through wall positions and comparing them to Chef's coordinates.

    The implemented solution successfully handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that if Chef's position was on a wall, it returned -1. Otherwise, it counted the walls that were above the maximum of Chef's x and y coordinates. The code was structured to read multiple test cases and queries efficiently.

    Key takeaways include the importance of checking conditions before performing calculations and the efficiency of using simple comparisons to solve geometric problems. The solution was effective, and no unexpected errors occurred during implementation. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def process_test_cases(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            walls = list(map(int, input().split()))
            Q = int(input())
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                x_j, y_j = map(int, input().split())
            
                if x_j == y_j and x_j in walls:
                    print(-1)
                    continue
            
                count = 0
                max_coord = max(x_j, y_j)
            
                for wall in walls:
                    if wall > max_coord:
                        count += 1
            
                print(count)

    T = int(input())
    process_test_cases(T)
    ```

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        In ChefLand, there is a mountain range consisting of $N$ hills (numbered $1$ through $N$) in a straight line. Let's denote the height of the $i$-th hill from the left by $h_i$.
        Ada is working on the water supply system of ChefLand. On some of the hills, she wants to place water reservoirs; then, for each reservoir, she will decide in which direction the water should flow from it â€” either to the left or to the right (water may not flow in both directions from the same reservoir). From a reservoir on a hill with height $h$, water flows in the chosen direction until it reaches the first hill that is strictly higher than $h$; all hills before this hill (including the hill containing the reservoir) are therefore supplied with water.
        For example, suppose we have hills with heights $[7, 2, 3, 5, 8]$. If we place a reservoir on the hill with height $5$, and pump water from it to the left, then the hills with heights $2$, $3$ and $5$ are supplied with water.
        Help Ada find the minimum numer of reservoirs needed to provide water to all the hills if she chooses the directions optimally.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
        - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
        - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_N$.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum required number of reservoirs.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $2 \le N \le 10^5$
        - $1 \le h_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
        - $h_i \neq h_j $ for any valid $i \neq j$
        - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$

        -----Example Input-----
        1
        6
        4 16 32 6 8 2

        -----Example Output-----
        2    

        -----Explanation-----
        Example case 1: We can place reservoirs on the second and third hill, pumping water to the left and right respectively.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
           We have a series of hills with different heights, and we need to determine the minimum number of water reservoirs required to supply water to all the hills. Each reservoir can supply water in one direction (left or right) until it reaches a taller hill. The goal is to find the optimal placement and direction for the reservoirs to minimize their number.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
           To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of hills and determine the points where we need to place reservoirs. We can keep track of the highest hill encountered so far as we move from left to right and from right to left. If a hill is taller than the highest hill we've seen in the current direction, we will need a reservoir there. By checking both directions, we can ensure that we cover all hills with the minimum number of reservoirs.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
           ```
           function min_reservoirs(N, heights):
               left_max = 0
               right_max = 0
               reservoirs = 0
       
               # Check from left to right
               for i from 0 to N-1:
                   if heights[i] > left_max:
                       left_max = heights[i]
                       reservoirs += 1
       
               # Check from right to left
               for i from N-1 to 0:
                   if heights[i] > right_max:
                       right_max = heights[i]
                       reservoirs += 1
       
               return reservoirs
       
           function process_test_cases(T):
               for each test case:
                   read N
                   read heights
                   print min_reservoirs(N, heights)

           read T
           process_test_cases(T)
           ```

   Chef needs to fence a rectangular area that covers a set of points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides aligned with a slope defined by a given number M. The goal is to calculate the minimum perimeter of this rectangle that can enclose all the points.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the minimum perimeter of the rectangle, we need to:
   - Transform the coordinates of the points based on the slope M. This involves rotating the coordinate system so that one side of the rectangle aligns with the slope M.
   - Calculate the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the transformed points to determine the dimensions of the rectangle.
   - Use these dimensions to compute the perimeter of the rectangle.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef needs to fence a rectangular area that covers a set of points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides aligned with a slope defined by a given number M. The goal is to calculate the minimum perimeter of this rectangle that can enclose all the points.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the minimum perimeter of the rectangle, we need to:
   - Transform the coordinates of the points based on the slope M. This involves rotating the coordinate system so that one side of the rectangle aligns with the slope M.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Transformation:**
   The transformation of the points based on the slope M was intended to align one side of the rectangle with the slope defined by M. The transformation used was:
   - `new_x = x - M * y`
   - `new_y = M * x + y`
   
   However, this transformation does not correctly represent the rotation needed to align the rectangle with the slope M. Instead, we need to rotate the points by an angle that corresponds to the slope M.

2. **Correcting the Transformation:**
   To align the rectangle with the slope M, we should use the following transformation:
   - The angle Î¸ can be derived from the slope M as `Î¸ = atan(M)`.
   - The new coordinates after rotation should be calculated using:
     - `new_x = x * cos(Î¸) + y * sin(Î¸)`
     - `new_y = -x * sin(Î¸) + y * cos(Î¸)`

3. **Calculating the Perimeter:**
   After transforming the points correctly, we need to find the minimum and maximum values of the transformed coordinates to determine the width and height of the rectangle. The perimeter is then calculated as `2 * (width + height)`.

4. **Identifying the Error in the Code:**
   The original code did not correctly implement the rotation transformation, which led to incorrect calculations of the rectangle's dimensions and, consequently, the perimeter.

Now, let's correct the code with the proper transformation and ensure it calculates the perimeter accurately.

```python
import math

def calculate_perimeter(N, M, points):
    # Calculate the angle theta from the slope M
    theta = math.atan(M)
    cos_theta = math.cos(theta)
    sin_theta = math.sin(theta)
    
    # Transform the points based on the slope M
    transformed_points = []
    for x, y in points:
        new_x = x * cos_theta + y * sin_theta  # Apply rotation for x
        new_y = -x * sin_theta + y * cos_theta  # Apply rotation for y
        transformed_points.append((new_x, new_y))
    
    # Find the min and max of the transformed coordinates
    min_x = min(new_x for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)
    max_x = max(new_x for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)
    min_y = min(new_y for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)
    max_y = max(new_y for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)
    
    # Calculate the width and height of the rectangle
    width = max_x - min_x
    height = max_y - min_y
    
    # Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle
    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
    
    return perimeter

def main():
    # Read the number of points and the slope M
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    points = []
    
    # Read each point's coordinates
    for _ in range(N):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        points.append((x, y))
    
    # Calculate the perimeter and print it
    perimeter = calculate_perimeter(N, M, points)
    print(perimeter)

# Execute the main function
main()
``` 

This code now correctly implements the transformation needed to align the rectangle with the slope M and calculates the perimeter accurately.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef needs to fence a rectangular area that covers a set of points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides aligned with a slope defined by a given number M. The goal is to calculate the minimum perimeter of this rectangle that can enclose all the points.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the minimum perimeter of the rectangle, we need to:
   - Transform the coordinates of the points based on the slope M. This involves rotating the coordinate system so that one side of the rectangle aligns with the slope M.
   - Calculate the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the transformed points to determine the dimensions of the rectangle.
   - Use these dimensions to compute the perimeter of the rectangle.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function calculate_perimeter(N, M, points):
       transformed_points = []
       for each point (x, y) in points:
           new_x = x - M * y
           new_y = M * x + y
           transformed_points.append((new_x, new_y))

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Transformation:**
   The transformation of the points based on the slope M was intended to align one side of the rectangle with the slope defined by M. The transformation used was:
   - `new_x = x - M * y`
   - `new_y = M * x + y`
   
   However, this transformation does not correctly represent the rotation needed to align the rectangle with the slope M. Instead, we need to rotate the points by an angle that corresponds to the slope M.

2. **Correcting the Transformation:**
   To align the rectangle with the slope M, we should use the following transformation:
   - The angle Î¸ can be derived from the slope M as `Î¸ = atan(M)`.
   - The new coordinates after rotation should be calculated using:
     - `new_x = x * cos(Î¸) + y * sin(Î¸)`
     - `new_y = -x * sin(Î¸) + y * cos(Î¸)`

3. **Calculating the Perimeter:**
   After transforming the points correctly, we need to find the minimum and maximum values of the transformed coordinates to determine the width and height of the rectangle. The perimeter is then calculated as `2 * (width + height)`.

4. **Identifying the Error in the Code:**
   The original code did not correctly implement the rotation transformation, which led to incorrect calculations of the rectangle's dimensions and, consequently, the perimeter.

Now, let's correct the code with the proper transformation and ensure it calculates the perimeter accurately.

```python
import math

def calculate_perimeter(N, M, points):
    # Calculate the angle theta from the slope M
    theta = math.atan(M)
    cos_theta = math.cos(theta)
    sin_theta = math.sin(theta)
    
    # Transform the points based on the slope M
    transformed_points = []
    for x, y in points:
        new_x = x * cos_theta + y * sin_theta  # Apply rotation for x
        new_y = -x * sin_theta + y * cos_theta  # Apply rotation for y
        transformed_points.append((new_x, new_y))
    
    # Find the min and max of the transformed coordinates
    min_x = min(new_x for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)
    max_x = max(new_x for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)
    min_y = min(new_y for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)
    max_y = max(new_y for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)
    
    # Calculate the width and height of the rectangle
    width = max_x - min_x
    height = max_y - min_y
    
    # Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle
    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
    
    return perimeter

def main():
    # Read the number of points and the slope M
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    points = []
    
    # Read each point's coordinates
    for _ in range(N):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        points.append((x, y))
    
    # Calculate the perimeter and print it
    perimeter = calculate_perimeter(N, M, points)
    print(perimeter)

# Execute the main function
main()
``` 

This code now correctly implements the transformation needed to align the rectangle with the slope M and calculates the perimeter accurately.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th term in a specific series defined as 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, etc. Initially, I misidentified the formula for generating the series, leading to incorrect outputs. The series is based on the sum of squares of the first (N-1) integers, which I failed to recognize at first.

    The correct approach involves calculating the sum of squares up to (N-1). The formula for the N'th term can be derived as follows: T(N) = sum(i^2) for i from 0 to N-1. This realization led to the correct implementation of the function.

    The final working code correctly computes the N'th term using a loop to sum the squares:

    ```python
    def calculate_series(N):
        sum_of_squares = 0
        for i in range(N):
            sum_of_squares += i * i
        return sum_of_squares

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        result = calculate_series(N)
        print(result)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing the series and recognizing patterns, as well as the need to validate the derived formulas against sample outputs.

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine how many walls he needs to break to reach Dr. Doof, based on given wall positions and Chef's starting coordinates. The problem involved checking if Chef's position was on any wall and counting how many walls were above his maximum coordinate.

    The core concept involved understanding the geometric representation of walls as line segments and how to efficiently determine the number of walls Chef would need to break through. The solution utilized a straightforward approach of iterating through wall positions and comparing them to Chef's coordinates.

    The implemented solution successfully handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that if Chef's position was on a wall, it returned -1. Otherwise, it counted the walls that were above the maximum of Chef's x and y coordinates. The code was structured to read multiple test cases and queries efficiently.

    Key takeaways include the importance of checking conditions before performing calculations and the efficiency of using simple comparisons to solve geometric problems. The solution was effective, and no unexpected errors occurred during implementation. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def process_test_cases(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            walls = list(map(int, input().split()))
            Q = int(input())
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                x_j, y_j = map(int, input().split())
            
                if x_j == y_j and x_j in walls:
                    print(-1)
                    continue
            
                count = 0
                max_coord = max(x_j, y_j)
            
                for wall in walls:
                    if wall > max_coord:
                        count += 1
            
                print(count)

    T = int(input())

    ```

   Chef needs to fence a rectangular area that covers a set of points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides aligned with a slope defined by a given number M. The goal is to calculate the minimum perimeter of this rectangle that can enclose all the points.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the minimum perimeter of the rectangle, we need to:
   - Transform the coordinates of the points based on the slope M. This involves rotating the coordinate system so that one side of the rectangle aligns with the slope M.
   - Calculate the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the transformed points to determine the dimensions of the rectangle.
   - Use these dimensions to compute the perimeter of the rectangle.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function calculate_perimeter(N, M, points):
       transformed_points = []
       for each point (x, y) in points:
           new_x = x - M * y
           new_y = M * x + y
           transformed_points.append((new_x, new_y))
       
       min_x = min(new_x for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)
       max_x = max(new_x for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)
       min_y = min(new_y for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)
       max_y = max(new_y for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)
       
       width = max_x - min_x
       height = max_y - min_y
       perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
       
       return perimeter

   function main():
       read N, M
       points = []
       for i from 0 to N-1:
           x, y = read point

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Transformation:**
   The transformation of the points based on the slope M was intended to align one side of the rectangle with the slope defined by M. The transformation used was:
   - `new_x = x - M * y`
   - `new_y = M * x + y`
   
   However, this transformation does not correctly represent the rotation needed to align the rectangle with the slope M. Instead, we need to rotate the points by an angle that corresponds to the slope M.

2. **Correcting the Transformation:**
   To align the rectangle with the slope M, we should use the following transformation:
   - The angle Î¸ can be derived from the slope M as `Î¸ = atan(M)`.
   - The new coordinates after rotation should be calculated using:
     - `new_x = x * cos(Î¸) + y * sin(Î¸)`
     - `new_y = -x * sin(Î¸) + y * cos(Î¸)`

3. **Calculating the Perimeter:**
   After transforming the points correctly, we need to find the minimum and maximum values of the transformed coordinates to determine the width and height of the rectangle. The perimeter is then calculated as `2 * (width + height)`.

4. **Identifying the Error in the Code:**
   The original code did not correctly implement the rotation transformation, which led to incorrect calculations of the rectangle's dimensions and, consequently, the perimeter.

Now, let's correct the code with the proper transformation and ensure it calculates the perimeter accurately.

```python
import math

def calculate_perimeter(N, M, points):
    # Calculate the angle theta from the slope M
    theta = math.atan(M)
    cos_theta = math.cos(theta)
    sin_theta = math.sin(theta)
    
    # Transform the points based on the slope M
    transformed_points = []
    for x, y in points:
        new_x = x * cos_theta + y * sin_theta  # Apply rotation for x
        new_y = -x * sin_theta + y * cos_theta  # Apply rotation for y
        transformed_points.append((new_x, new_y))
    
    # Find the min and max of the transformed coordinates
    min_x = min(new_x for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)
    max_x = max(new_x for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)
    min_y = min(new_y for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)
    max_y = max(new_y for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)
    
    # Calculate the width and height of the rectangle
    width = max_x - min_x
    height = max_y - min_y
    
    # Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle
    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
    
    return perimeter

def main():
    # Read the number of points and the slope M
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    points = []
    
    # Read each point's coordinates
    for _ in range(N):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        points.append((x, y))
    
    # Calculate the perimeter and print it
    perimeter = calculate_perimeter(N, M, points)
    print(perimeter)

# Execute the main function
main()
```

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to calculate the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that can enclose a set of points on a 2D plane, with one side aligned to a specified slope M. The key challenge was correctly transforming the coordinates of the points to align with the slope, which required understanding the geometric implications of the slope.

Initially, I incorrectly applied a transformation that did not accurately rotate the points according to the slope M. This led to incorrect calculations of the rectangle's dimensions and perimeter. The correct approach involved calculating the angle Î¸ from the slope M using `atan(M)` and then applying the appropriate rotation formulas:

```python
new_x = x * cos(theta) + y * sin(theta)
new_y = -x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)
```

After transforming the points correctly, I computed the minimum and maximum values of the transformed coordinates to determine the rectangle's width and height, and subsequently calculated the perimeter.

The final solution successfully passed all tests, demonstrating the importance of correctly understanding and applying geometric transformations in problems involving slopes and coordinates. The final code snippet is as follows:

```python
import math

def calculate_perimeter(N, M, points):
    theta = math.atan(M)
    cos_theta = math.cos(theta)
    sin_theta = math.sin(theta)
    
    transformed_points = []
    for x, y in points:
        new_x = x * cos_theta + y * sin_theta
        new_y = -x * sin_theta + y * cos_theta
        transformed_points.append((new_x, new_y))
    
    min_x = min(new_x for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)
    max_x = max(new_x for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)
    min_y = min(new_y for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)
    max_y = max(new_y for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)
    
    width = max_x - min_x
    height = max_y - min_y
    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)
    
    return perimeter

def main():
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    points = []
    for _ in range(N):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        points.append((x, y))
    
    perimeter = calculate_perimeter(N, M, points)
    print(perimeter)

main()
``` 

This experience reinforced the importance of precise mathematical transformations in computational geometry problems.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
import math


n,m = map(int, input().split())
hyp = math.sqrt(1+m*m)
cosx = 1/hyp
sinx = m/hyp

pts = [[], []]
for i in range(n):
    p = input().split()
    px = int(p[0])
    py = int(p[1])
    pts[0].append(cosx*px+sinx*py)
    pts[1].append(cosx*py-sinx*px)

w = max(pts[0])-min(pts[0])
l = max(pts[1])-min(pts[1])

print(2*l+2*w)

INFO - [Task id] 1459 [generation text] In reflecting on my attempts to solve the problem, I gained several insights that could be useful for future reference:

1. **Transformation Approach**: The official solution uses a more efficient method to transform the points based on the slope M. Instead of calculating the angle using `atan`, it directly computes the cosine and sine values based on the slope. This avoids the need for trigonometric function calls during the transformation of each point, which can be computationally expensive.

2. **Normalization of the Slope**: The official solution normalizes the slope by calculating the hypotenuse (`hyp = sqrt(1 + m*m)`). This allows for a straightforward calculation of the cosine and sine values (`cosx` and `sinx`), which are then used to transform the points. This normalization is a key step that simplifies the transformation process.

3. **Efficient Point Storage**: The official solution uses a list of lists (`pts = [[], []]`) to store the transformed x and y coordinates separately. This makes it easy to compute the minimum and maximum values for both dimensions in a single pass.

4. **Perimeter Calculation**: The perimeter is calculated directly from the width and length derived from the transformed coordinates. This is a clear and efficient way to derive the final result.

5. **Code Simplicity**: The official solution is concise and avoids unnecessary complexity. It reads input, processes the points, and outputs the result in a straightforward manner.

Overall, the official solution is more efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. It highlights the importance of optimizing mathematical transformations and using efficient data structures for storing and processing data. In future problems, I will aim to consider normalization and direct calculations to simplify transformations and improve performance.
