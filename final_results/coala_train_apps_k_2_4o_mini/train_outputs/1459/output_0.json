The rectangle must have one of its sides aligned with a slope defined by a given number M. The goal is to calculate the minimum perimeter of this rectangle that can enclose all the points.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To find the minimum perimeter of the rectangle, we need to:\n   - Transform the coordinates of the points based on the slope M. This involves rotating the coordinate system so that one side of the rectangle aligns with the slope M.\n   - Calculate the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the transformed points to determine the dimensions of the rectangle.\n   - Use these dimensions to compute the perimeter of the rectangle.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function calculate_perimeter(N, M, points):\n       transformed_points = []\n       for each point (x, y) in points:\n           new_x = x - M * y\n           new_y = M * x + y\n           transformed_points.append((new_x, new_y))\n       \n       min_x = min(new_x for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)\n       max_x = max(new_x for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)\n       min_y = min(new_y for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)\n       max_y = max(new_y for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)\n       \n       width = max_x - min_x\n       height = max_y - min_y\n       perimeter = 2 * (width + height)\n       \n       return perimeter\n\n   function main():\n       read N, M\n       points = []\n       for i from 0 to N-1:\n           x, y = read point\n           points.append((x, y))\n       \n       perimeter = calculate_perimeter(N, M, points)\n       print(perimeter)\n\n   main()\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef calculate_perimeter(N, M, points):\n    # Transform the points based on the slope M\n    transformed_points = []\n    for x, y in points:\n        new_x = x - M * y  # Apply transformation for x\n        new_y = M * x + y  # Apply transformation for y\n        transformed_points.append((new_x, new_y))\n    \n    # Find the min and max of the transformed coordinates\n    min_x = min(new_x for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)\n    max_x = max(new_x for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)\n    min_y = min(new_y for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)\n    max_y = max(new_y for new_x, new_y in transformed_points)\n    \n    # Calculate the width and height of the rectangle\n    width = max_x - min_x\n    height = max_y - min_y\n    \n    # Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle\n    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)\n    \n    return perimeter\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the number of points and the slope M\n    N, M = map(int, input().split())\n    points = []\n    \n    # Read each point's coordinates\n    for _ in range(N):\n        x, y = map(int, input().split())\n        points.append((x, y))\n    \n    # Calculate the perimeter and print it\n    perimeter = calculate_perimeter(N, M, points)\n    print(perimeter)\n\n# Execute the main function\nmain()\n```",
