    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The task is to calculate the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number \"N\". We will be given multiple test cases, each specifying a different value of \"N\".\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The multiples of 10 up to \"N\" form an arithmetic series where the first term is 10 and the common difference is also 10. The last term in this series can be found by taking the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to \"N\", which is `N // 10 * 10`. The number of terms in this series can be calculated as `N // 10`. The sum of the series can then be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = \\frac{\\text{number of terms}}{2} \\times (\\text{first term} + \\text{last term})\n   \\]\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Read integer T (number of test cases)\n   For each test case:\n       Read integer N\n       Calculate last_term = (N // 10) * 10\n       Calculate number_of_terms = N // 10\n       If number_of_terms > 0:\n           Calculate sum = (number_of_terms / 2) * (10 + last_term)\n       Else:\n           sum = 0\n       Print sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef calculate_sum_of_multiples_of_10(T):\n    for _ in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case\n        N = int(input())  # Read the integer N\n        last_term = (N // 10) * 10  # Calculate the largest multiple of 10 <= N\n        number_of_terms = N // 10  # Calculate how many multiples of 10 are there\n        \n        if number_of_terms > 0:  # If there are multiples of 10\n            # Calculate the sum using the arithmetic series formula\n            total_sum = (number_of_terms * (10 + last_term)) // 2\n        else:\n            total_sum = 0  # If there are no multiples of 10\n        \n        print(total_sum)  # Output the result for the test case\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ncalculate_sum_of_multiples_of_10(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases\n```",
