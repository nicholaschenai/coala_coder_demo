INFO - [Task id] 837 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to calculate the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number "N". We will do this for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each test case, we will find the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to N. This can be done by taking the integer division of N by 10 and then multiplying by 10.
   - Once we have the largest multiple of 10, we can calculate the sum of all multiples of 10 up to that number. The multiples of 10 form an arithmetic series where the first term is 10, the last term is the largest multiple of 10, and the common difference is also 10.
   - The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
     \]
     where \( n \) is the number of terms. The number of terms can be found by dividing the largest multiple of 10 by 10.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sum_of_multiples_of_10(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N = test_case
           largest_multiple_of_10 = (N // 10) * 10
           number_of_terms = largest_multiple_of_10 // 10
           sum = (number_of_terms / 2) * (10 + largest_multiple_of_10)
           print(sum)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def sum_of_multiples_of_10(T, test_cases):
    # Iterate through each test case
    for N in test_cases:
        # Find the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N
        largest_multiple_of_10 = (N // 10) * 10
        # Calculate the number of terms in the series of multiples of 10
        number_of_terms = largest_multiple_of_10 // 10
        # Calculate the sum using the arithmetic series formula
        sum_of_multiples = (number_of_terms * (10 + largest_multiple_of_10)) // 2
        # Print the result for the current test case
        print(sum_of_multiples)

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Avani calculate the sum of values from a list of bills based on multiple queries. Each query specified a range of indices, and the goal was to return the sum of the values in that range for each query. The problem involved reading multiple test cases, processing a list of integers, and efficiently calculating sums based on given indices.

    The solution involved iterating through each test case, reading the number of bills and queries, and then processing each query by summing the specified range of values. The use of Python's built-in `sum()` function allowed for straightforward calculation of the sums. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints provided.

    The final code snippet effectively handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that results were printed for each query. The approach was successful, and no unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation. The key takeaway was the importance of efficiently managing input and output, especially when dealing with potentially large datasets. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code for reference:

    ```python
    def process_queries(T):
        for _ in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case
            N, Q = map(int, input().split())  # Read number of bills and queries
            bills = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the list of bills
        
            for __ in range(Q):  # Iterate over each query
                X, Y = map(int, input().split())  # Read the query indices
                # Calculate the sum from index X-1 to Y-1 (inclusive)
                total_sum = sum(bills[X-1:Y])  
                print(total_sum)  # Output the result for the query

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    process_queries(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases
    ```
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th term in a specific series defined as 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, etc. Initially, I misidentified the formula for generating the series, leading to incorrect outputs. The series is based on the sum of squares of the first (N-1) integers, which I failed to recognize at first.

    The correct approach involves calculating the sum of squares up to (N-1). The formula for the N'th term can be derived as follows: T(N) = sum(i^2) for i from 0 to N-1. This realization led to the correct implementation of the function.

    The final working code correctly computes the N'th term using a loop to sum the squares:

    ```python
    def calculate_series(N):
        sum_of_squares = 0
        for i in range(N):
            sum_of_squares += i * i
        return sum_of_squares

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        result = calculate_series(N)
        print(result)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing the series and recognizing patterns, as well as the need to validate the derived formulas against sample outputs.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 837 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to compute the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to a given number "N" for multiple test cases. The solution involved recognizing that the multiples of 10 form an arithmetic series, which allowed for an efficient calculation using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

Key concepts included:
- Understanding how to derive the last term of the series as the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to "N".
- Using integer division to determine the number of terms in the series.
- Applying the arithmetic series sum formula to compute the total efficiently.

The implemented solution successfully handled the input and output requirements, iterating through each test case and calculating the required sum. The code snippet used was:

```python
def calculate_sum_of_multiples_of_10(T):
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        last_term = (N // 10) * 10
        number_of_terms = N // 10
        
        if number_of_terms > 0:
            total_sum = (number_of_terms * (10 + last_term)) // 2
        else:
            total_sum = 0
        
        print(total_sum)

T = int(input())
calculate_sum_of_multiples_of_10(T)
```

The solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating a clear understanding of arithmetic series and effective use of basic arithmetic operations. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 837 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to calculate the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number "N". We will be given multiple test cases, each specifying a different value of "N".

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The multiples of 10 up to "N" form an arithmetic series where the first term is 10 and the common difference is also 10. The last term in this series can be found by taking the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to "N", which is `N // 10 * 10`. The number of terms in this series can be calculated as `N // 10`. The sum of the series can then be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: 
   \[
   \text{Sum} = \frac{\text{number of terms}}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
   \]

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Read integer T (number of test cases)
   For each test case:
       Read integer N
       Calculate last_term = (N // 10) * 10
       Calculate number_of_terms = N // 10
       If number_of_terms > 0:
           Calculate sum = (number_of_terms / 2) * (10 + last_term)
       Else:
           sum = 0
       Print sum

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for t in range(eval(input())):
 n=eval(input())
 n-=n%10
 n/=10
 print(n*(n+1)/2*10)

INFO - [Task id] 837 [generation text] The official solution provided is concise and leverages a mathematical approach to efficiently calculate the sum of multiples of 10. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Mathematical Simplification**: The official solution first reduces the input number \( N \) to the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to \( N \) by using `n -= n % 10`. This step ensures that we only consider relevant multiples of 10.

2. **Count of Multiples**: The solution then calculates how many multiples of 10 exist up to \( N \) by dividing \( N \) by 10. This is done with `n /= 10`, which effectively counts the multiples of 10.

3. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first \( k \) multiples of 10 can be derived from the formula for the sum of the first \( k \) natural numbers, scaled by 10. The formula used is `print(n * (n + 1) / 2 * 10)`, which computes the sum of the first \( n \) integers and multiplies it by 10 to get the sum of the multiples of 10.

4. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient, operating in constant time \( O(1) \) for each test case, as it uses direct arithmetic operations rather than iterating through numbers.

In contrast, my initial approach involved more steps and checks, which could be simplified. The official solution's use of direct arithmetic operations not only makes it more elegant but also reduces the potential for errors and improves performance, especially given the constraints where \( N \) can be as large as 1 billion. 

Overall, this experience highlights the importance of leveraging mathematical properties to simplify problems, especially when dealing with large numbers.
