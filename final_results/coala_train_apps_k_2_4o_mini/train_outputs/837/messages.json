The multiples of 10 form an arithmetic series where the first term is 10, the last term is the largest multiple of 10, and the common difference is also 10.\n   - The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (\\text{first term} + \\text{last term})\n     \\]\n     where \\( n \\) is the number of terms.

Each query specified a range of indices, and the goal was to return the sum of the values in that range for each query. The problem involved reading multiple test cases, processing a list of integers, and efficiently calculating sums based on given indices.\n\n    The solution involved iterating through each test case, reading the number of bills and queries, and then processing each query by summing the specified range of values. The use of Python's built-in `sum()` function allowed for straightforward calculation of the sums. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints provided.\n\n    The final code snippet effectively handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that results were printed for each query. The approach was successful, and no unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation. The key takeaway was the importance of efficiently managing input and output, especially when dealing with potentially large datasets. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def process_queries(T):\n        for _ in range(T):  # Iterate over each test case\n            N, Q = map(int, input().split())  # Read number of bills and queries\n            bills = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the list of bills\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):  # Iterate over each query\n                X, Y = map(int, input().split())  # Read the query indices\n                # Calculate the sum from index X-1 to Y-1 (inclusive)\n                total_sum = sum(bills[X-1:Y])  \n                print(total_sum)  # Output the result for the query\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    process_queries(T)  # Call the function with the number of test cases\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th term in a specific series defined as 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, etc. Initially, I misidentified the formula for generating the series, leading to incorrect outputs. The series is based on the sum of squares of the first (N-1) integers, which I failed to recognize at first.\n\n    The correct approach involves calculating the sum of squares up to (N-1). The formula for the N'th term can be derived as follows: T(N) = sum(i^2) for i from 0 to N-1. This realization led to the correct implementation of the function.\n\n    The final working code correctly computes the N'th term using a loop to sum the squares:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_series(N):\n        sum_of_squares = 0\n        for i in range(N):\n            sum_of_squares += i * i\n        return sum_of_squares\n\n    T = int(input())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        result = calculate_series(N)\n        print(result)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing the series and recognizing patterns, as well as the need to validate the derived formulas against sample outputs.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

        "content": "The official solution provided is concise and leverages a mathematical approach to efficiently calculate the sum of multiples of 10. Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Mathematical Simplification**: The official solution first reduces the input number \\( N \\) to the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to \\( N \\) by using `n -= n % 10`. This step ensures that we only consider relevant multiples of 10.\n\n2. **Count of Multiples**: The solution then calculates how many multiples of 10 exist up to \\( N \\) by dividing \\( N \\) by 10. This is done with `n /= 10`, which effectively counts the multiples of 10.\n\n3. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first \\( k \\) multiples of 10 can be derived from the formula for the sum of the first \\( k \\) natural numbers, scaled by 10. The formula used is `print(n * (n + 1) / 2 * 10)`, which computes the sum of the first \\( n \\) integers and multiplies it by 10 to get the sum of the multiples of 10.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient, operating in constant time \\( O(1) \\) for each test case, as it uses direct arithmetic operations rather than iterating through numbers.\n\nIn contrast, my initial approach involved more steps and checks, which could be simplified. The official solution's use of direct arithmetic operations not only makes it more elegant but also reduces the potential for errors and improves performance, especially given the constraints where \\( N \\) can be as large as 1 billion. \n\nOverall, this experience highlights the importance of leveraging mathematical properties to simplify problems, especially when dealing with large numbers."
