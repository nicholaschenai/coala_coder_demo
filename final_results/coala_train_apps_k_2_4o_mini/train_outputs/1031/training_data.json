    "summary": "### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Right-Angled Triangle Problem\n\nThe problem involved finding the lengths of the legs \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) of a right-angled triangle given the hypotenuse \\( H \\) and the area \\( S \\). The key relationships used were the area formula \\( S = \\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times b \\) and the Pythagorean theorem \\( H^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\).\n\n#### Key Concepts:\n1. **Area and Hypotenuse Relationship**: The area can be expressed in terms of the legs, and the legs can be related to the hypotenuse through the Pythagorean theorem.\n2. **Quadratic Equation Derivation**: By substituting \\( b = \\frac{2S}{a} \\) into the Pythagorean theorem, a quadratic equation in terms of \\( a \\) can be derived.\n\n#### Strategies and Errors:\n- Initial attempts included checking if \\( S \\times 2 > H^2 \\) to determine if a triangle could exist, which was insufficient.\n- The discriminant calculation was crucial but was not correctly implemented in earlier versions, leading to incorrect outputs.\n- Validating the results required ensuring both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) were positive and satisfied the triangle properties.\n\n#### Final Code Snippet:\nThe final approach involved calculating potential values for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) and checking their validity:\n\n```python\ndef find_triangle(T, test_cases):\n    for H, S in test_cases:\n        if S * 2 > H * H:\n            print(-1)\n            continue\n        \n        discriminant = H * H * H * H / 4 - 2 * S * S\n        if discriminant < 0:\n            print(-1)\n            continue\n        \n        sqrt_discriminant = discriminant ** 0.5\n        a1 = (H * H / 2 + sqrt_discriminant) ** 0.5\n        a2 = (H * H / 2 - sqrt_discriminant) ** 0.5\n        \n        b1 = (2 * S) / a1 if a1 != 0 else 0\n        b2 = (2 * S) / a2 if a2 != 0 else 0\n        \n        valid_sides = []\n        if a1 > 0 and b1 > 0 and abs(a1**2 + b1**2 - H**2) < 1e-6:\n            valid_sides.append(sorted([a1, b1, H]))\n        if a2 > 0 and b2 > 0 and abs(a2**2 + b2**2 - H**2) < 1e-6:\n            valid_sides.append(sorted([a2, b2, H]))\n        \n        if valid_sides:\n            final_sides = min(valid_sides)\n            print(f\"{final_sides[0]:.5f} {final_sides[1]:.5f} {final_sides[2]:.5f}\")\n        else:\n            print(-1)\n```\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of correctly deriving and validating mathematical relationships in programming problems, especially when dealing with geometric properties.",
    "reflection": "The official solution provides a more streamlined approach to solving the problem of finding a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \\( H \\) and area \\( S \\). Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that can be useful for future reference:\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n1. **Discriminant Check**:\n   - The solution first checks if the expression \\((H^4 - 16S^2)\\) is negative. If it is, it immediately outputs `-1`, indicating that a triangle cannot be formed. This is a crucial step that simplifies the problem by eliminating impossible cases early.\n\n2. **Calculating the Base**:\n   - The base \\( B \\) of the triangle is calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     B = \\frac{\\sqrt{H^2 + \\sqrt{H^4 - 16S^2}}}{\\sqrt{2}}\n     \\]\n   - This formula derives from the relationships between the sides of the triangle and the area, effectively combining the Pythagorean theorem and the area formula.\n\n3. **Calculating the Other Side**:\n   - The other side \\( P \\) is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     P = \\frac{2S}{B}\n     \\]\n   - This ensures that the area condition is satisfied.\n\n4. **Output Formatting**:\n   - The solution ensures that the sides are printed in non-decreasing order and formatted to six decimal places, which is important for precision in output.\n\n5. **Efficiency**:\n   - The solution is efficient, handling multiple test cases in a single loop and performing calculations in constant time for each test case.\n\n### Reflection on My Attempts:\n- My previous attempts failed primarily due to incorrect handling of the quadratic relationships and checks for valid triangle sides. I did not simplify the problem effectively by checking the discriminant early on, which led to unnecessary calculations.\n- The official solution's approach to directly calculating the base and the other side using derived formulas is more effective and concise. It avoids the complexity of solving a quadratic equation explicitly, which I attempted in my solutions.\n- The use of mathematical functions like `sqrt` from the `math` library in the official solution also ensures that calculations are handled accurately and efficiently.\n\nOverall, the official solution provides a clearer and more efficient method for solving the problem, emphasizing the importance of early checks and direct calculations. This experience highlights the value of simplifying complex problems and leveraging mathematical relationships effectively.",
