The solution utilized a sliding window approach, which is effective for problems involving contiguous subarrays. \n\n    The core concept involved maintaining two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the current subarray. As the `right` pointer expanded to include more elements, we counted the odd numbers. If the count exceeded `k`, we moved the `left` pointer to reduce the count. When the count matched `k`, we calculated how many valid subarrays could be formed by counting the even numbers to the left of the `left` pointer.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test cases. The key strategies that worked included efficiently managing the count of odd numbers and leveraging the properties of even numbers to determine the number of valid subarrays.
