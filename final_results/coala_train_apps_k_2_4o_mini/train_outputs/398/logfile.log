INFO - [Task id] 398 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find how many continuous subarrays (a contiguous part of the array) in a given list of integers have a sum that equals a specified integer `k`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a hashmap (dictionary) to keep track of the cumulative sums we encounter as we iterate through the array. For each element in the array, we calculate the cumulative sum up to that point. If the difference between the cumulative sum and `k` exists in our hashmap, it means there is a subarray that sums to `k`. We will also keep a count of how many times each cumulative sum has occurred to help us find the number of valid subarrays.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize a hashmap to store cumulative sums and their counts
   Initialize a variable to keep track of the cumulative sum
   Initialize a variable to count the number of valid subarrays

   For each number in the array:
       Update the cumulative sum by adding the current number
       If the cumulative sum equals k, increment the count
       If (cumulative sum - k) exists in the hashmap, add its count to the total count
       Update the hashmap with the current cumulative sum
   Return the total count

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to count the number of continuous subarrays that contain exactly `k` odd numbers from a given list of integers. The solution utilized a sliding window approach, which is effective for problems involving contiguous subarrays. 

    The core concept involved maintaining two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the current subarray. As the `right` pointer expanded to include more elements, we counted the odd numbers. If the count exceeded `k`, we moved the `left` pointer to reduce the count. When the count matched `k`, we calculated how many valid subarrays could be formed by counting the even numbers to the left of the `left` pointer.

    The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test cases. The key strategies that worked included efficiently managing the count of odd numbers and leveraging the properties of even numbers to determine the number of valid subarrays. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed well within the constraints. 

    The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
            count = 0
            left = 0
            odd_count = 0
            total_nice_subarrays = 0
        
            for right in range(len(nums)):
                if nums[right] % 2 == 1:
                    odd_count += 1
            
                while odd_count > k:
                    if nums[left] % 2 == 1:
                        odd_count -= 1
                    left += 1
            
                if odd_count == k:
                    temp_left = left
                    while temp_left < right and nums[temp_left] % 2 == 0:
                        temp_left += 1
                    count_left = temp_left - left + 1
                    total_nice_subarrays += count_left
        
            return total_nice_subarrays
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the effectiveness of the sliding window technique for problems involving subarrays and counting specific conditions.

        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
           We need to find the number of continuous subarrays from a given array of integers that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. A subarray is defined as a contiguous part of the array.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
           To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach to count the number of odd numbers in the subarrays. We will maintain two pointers to represent the start and end of the current subarray. As we expand the end pointer, we will count the odd numbers. When the count of odd numbers exceeds `k`, we will move the start pointer to reduce the count. We will also keep track of how many valid subarrays we can form when we have exactly `k` odd numbers.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the total number of continuous subarrays from a given array of integers that sum up to a specific integer `k`. A subarray is defined as a contiguous segment of the array.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a hashmap (dictionary) to keep track of the cumulative sums we encounter as we iterate through the array. For each element, we calculate the cumulative sum up to that point. If the difference between the current cumulative sum and `k` exists in our hashmap, it means there are subarrays that sum to `k`. We will also keep track of how many times each cumulative sum has occurred to count the number of valid subarrays.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function subarraySum(nums, k):
       Initialize a hashmap to store cumulative sums and their counts
       Initialize cumulative_sum to 0
       Initialize count to 0
       Add an entry for cumulative_sum 0 in the hashmap with count 1

       for each number in nums:
           Update cumulative_sum by adding the current number
           Check if (cumulative_sum - k) exists in the hashmap
           If it exists, add the count of that cumulative_sum to the total count

INFO - [Task id] 398 [generation text] The problem involved finding the total number of continuous subarrays within an array of integers that sum to a given integer `k`. The solution utilized a hashmap to track cumulative sums and their occurrences, allowing for efficient counting of valid subarrays.

Key concepts included:
- **Cumulative Sum**: This technique helps in determining the sum of elements in a subarray by maintaining a running total.
- **Hashmap for Counting**: By storing the counts of cumulative sums, we can quickly check how many times a specific sum has occurred, which directly relates to finding subarrays that sum to `k`.

The implemented solution iterated through the array, updating the cumulative sum and checking if the difference between the cumulative sum and `k` existed in the hashmap. If it did, the count of that cumulative sum was added to the total count of valid subarrays. The hashmap was updated with the current cumulative sum after each iteration.

The final code snippet is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
        cumulative_sum_count = {}
        cumulative_sum = 0
        count = 0
        cumulative_sum_count[0] = 1
        
        for num in nums:
            cumulative_sum += num
            
            if (cumulative_sum - k) in cumulative_sum_count:
                count += cumulative_sum_count[cumulative_sum - k]
            
            if cumulative_sum in cumulative_sum_count:
                cumulative_sum_count[cumulative_sum] += 1
            else:
                cumulative_sum_count[cumulative_sum] = 1
        
        return count
```

This approach proved effective, passing the provided test case and demonstrating the efficiency of using cumulative sums and hashmaps for this type of problem.

INFO - [Task id] 398 [generation text] The official solution effectively utilizes a hashmap to track cumulative sums, which is a key insight for solving the problem of finding continuous subarrays that sum to a given integer `k`. The approach is efficient, operating in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input array. This is achieved by iterating through the array once while maintaining a running total of the cumulative sum.

Key steps in the official solution include:
1. Initializing a dictionary to store the counts of cumulative sums, starting with an entry for the cumulative sum of 0.
2. Iterating through the array and updating the cumulative sum with each element.
3. Checking if the difference between the current cumulative sum and `k` exists in the dictionary. If it does, it indicates that there are subarrays that sum to `k`, and the count of such occurrences is added to the answer.
4. Updating the dictionary with the current cumulative sum, either by incrementing its count or adding it if it doesn't exist.

My approach was similar in logic but could have been more concise. The official solution's clarity in handling the hashmap and cumulative sums is a good reference for future problems involving subarray sums. The use of a single loop and direct dictionary operations makes it both efficient and easy to understand. 

Overall, this experience reinforces the importance of using cumulative sums and hashmaps for problems involving subarrays, as they can significantly reduce the complexity compared to a naive nested loop approach.

- Read through the problem and solution carefully.
- Reason out, step by step, in what scenarios this knowledge would be useful.
- Focus on general patterns and situations to help connect this knowledge to new situations.
- Then, include a list of keywords that are useful for searching this problem/solution pair.

## Response format
Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"scenarios": {"description": "In what scenarios will this knowledge be useful? Answer in a paragraph.", "title": "Scenarios", "type": "string"}, "keywords": {"description": "List of keywords that are useful for searching this problem/solution pair", "items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Keywords", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["scenarios", "keywords"]}
```

[Problem]
    Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.

    Example 1:

    Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
    Output: 2



    Note:

    The length of the array is in range [1, 20,000].
    The range of numbers in the array is [-1000, 1000] and the range of the integer k is [-1e7, 1e7].
[/Problem]

[Solution]

    class Solution:
        def subarraySum(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
            # Initialize a hashmap to store cumulative sums and their counts
            cumulative_sum_count = {}
            cumulative_sum = 0
            count = 0
        
            # Add an entry for cumulative_sum 0 in the hashmap with count 1
            cumulative_sum_count[0] = 1
        
            # Iterate through each number in the array
            for num in nums:
                # Update cumulative_sum by adding the current number
                cumulative_sum += num
            
                # Check if (cumulative_sum - k) exists in the hashmap
                if (cumulative_sum - k) in cumulative_sum_count:
                    # If it exists, add the count of that cumulative_sum to the total count
                    count += cumulative_sum_count[cumulative_sum - k]
            
                # Update the hashmap with the current cumulative_sum
                if cumulative_sum in cumulative_sum_count:
                    cumulative_sum_count[cumulative_sum] += 1
                else:
                    cumulative_sum_count[cumulative_sum] = 1
        
            # Return the total count of subarrays that sum to k
            return count
