    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   Alice has a collection of cards represented as an array of integers. She wants to rearrange these cards into groups of size `W`, where each group consists of `W` consecutive integers. The task is to determine if it is possible to rearrange the cards in such a way.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - First, check if the total number of cards is divisible by `W`. If not, it's impossible to form groups of size `W`.\n   - Next, sort the array of cards. This will help in easily forming groups of consecutive integers.\n   - Then, iterate through the sorted array and try to form groups of `W` consecutive integers. For each group, check if the next `W` integers can be formed from the current integer. If we can form all groups successfully, return true; otherwise, return false.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function isNStraightHand(hand, W):\n       if length of hand is not divisible by W:\n           return false\n       \n       sort hand\n       create a frequency map of hand\n       \n       for each card in hand:\n           if card is not in frequency map:\n               continue\n           while frequency map has card:\n               for i from 0 to W-1:\n                   if card + i is not in frequency map or frequency map[card + i] is 0:\n                       return false\n                   decrease frequency map[card + i] by 1\n       return true\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def isNStraightHand(self, hand: List[int], W: int) -> bool:\n        # Check if the total number of cards is divisible by W\n        if len(hand) % W != 0:\n            return False\n        \n        # Sort the hand to facilitate grouping\n        hand.sort()\n        \n        # Create a frequency map to count occurrences of each card\n        frequency = {}\n        for card in hand:\n            if card in frequency:\n                frequency[card] += 1\n            else:\n                frequency[card] = 1\n        \n        # Try to form groups of W consecutive cards\n        for card in hand:\n            if card in frequency and frequency[card] > 0:\n                # Start forming a group from the current card\n                for i in range(W):\n                    current_card = card + i\n                    if current_card not in frequency or frequency[current_card] <= 0:\n                        return False\n                    # Decrease the count of the current card in the frequency map\n                    frequency[current_card] -= 1\n        \n        return True  # All groups formed successfully\n```",
