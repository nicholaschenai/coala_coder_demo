    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   We need to determine the maximum profit that can be made from buying and selling a stock, given that we can perform at most two transactions. A transaction consists of buying a stock and then selling it later. We cannot buy stocks again until we have sold the previous ones.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will maintain two arrays to keep track of the maximum profit we can achieve with one transaction and two transactions. The idea is to iterate through the prices and calculate the maximum profit for each day, considering both the first and second transactions. We will keep track of the minimum price seen so far to calculate potential profits.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function maxProfit(prices):\n       if prices is empty:\n           return 0\n       \n       n = length of prices\n       first_profit = array of size n initialized to 0\n       second_profit = array of size n initialized to 0\n       \n       min_price = prices[0]\n       for i from 1 to n-1:\n           min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])\n           first_profit[i] = max(first_profit[i-1], prices[i] - min_price)\n       \n       max_price = prices[n-1]\n       for i from n-2 down to 0:\n           max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])\n           second_profit[i] = max(second_profit[i+1], max_price - prices[i])\n       \n       max_profit = 0\n       for i from 0 to n-1:\n           max_profit = max(max_profit, first_profit[i] + second_profit[i])\n       \n       return max_profit\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Check if the prices list is empty\n        if not prices:\n            return 0\n        \n        n = len(prices)\n        # Arrays to store the maximum profit for one and two transactions\n        first_profit = [0] * n\n        second_profit = [0] * n\n        \n        # Calculate maximum profit for the first transaction\n        min_price = prices[0]\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])\n            first_profit[i] = max(first_profit[i - 1], prices[i] - min_price)\n        \n        # Calculate maximum profit for the second transaction\n        max_price = prices[n - 1]\n        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):\n            max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])\n            second_profit[i] = max(second_profit[i + 1], max_price - prices[i])\n        \n        # Calculate the maximum profit by combining both transactions\n        max_profit = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            max_profit = max(max_profit, first_profit[i] + second_profit[i])\n        \n        return max_profit\n```",
