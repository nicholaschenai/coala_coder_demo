## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note:Â You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:


Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Â             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

Example 2:


Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Â             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
Â             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.


Example 3:


Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        
```

INFO - [Task id] 238 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a list of stock prices where each element represents the price of a stock on a specific day. Our goal is to determine the maximum profit we can achieve by making at most two buy-sell transactions. We cannot buy stocks again until we have sold the previous ones.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can break it down into two main parts:
   - First, we will calculate the maximum profit we can achieve with one transaction from the start of the list to each day.
   - Then, we will calculate the maximum profit we can achieve with one transaction from each day to the end of the list.
   - Finally, we will combine these two results to find the maximum profit we can achieve with two transactions by iterating through the days and summing the profits from the two parts.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function maxProfit(prices):
       if prices is empty:
           return 0
       
       n = length of prices
       create an array left_profit of size n
       create an array right_profit of size n
       
       // Calculate maximum profit for one transaction from the left
       min_price = prices[0]
       for i from 0 to n-1:
           min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])
           left_profit[i] = max(left_profit[i-1], prices[i] - min_price)
       
       // Calculate maximum profit for one transaction from the right
       max_price = prices[n-1]
       for i from n-1 down to 0:
           max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])
           right_profit[i] = max(right_profit[i+1], max_price - prices[i])
       
       // Combine the results to find the maximum profit with two transactions
       max_profit = 0
       for i from 0 to n-1:
           max_profit = max(max_profit, left_profit[i] + right_profit[i])
       
       return max_profit
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy given a list of prices and a budget. The core concept involved sorting the prices to prioritize cheaper chocolates, allowing for the purchase of the maximum quantity without exceeding the budget.

    The solution involved the following steps:
    1. Sort the list of chocolate prices in ascending order.
    2. Iterate through the sorted prices, maintaining a running total of the amount spent and the count of chocolates bought.
    3. Stop the iteration when adding another chocolate would exceed the budget.

    The implemented code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was straightforward, leading to a correct solution. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def max_chocolates(n, k, prices):
        prices.sort()
        total_spent = 0
        chocolates_bought = 0
    
        for price in prices:
            if total_spent + price <= k:
                total_spent += price
                chocolates_bought += 1
            else:
                break
    
        return chocolates_bought

    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = max_chocolates(n, k, prices)
    print(result)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of sorting in optimization problems and the effectiveness of a greedy approach in maximizing the number of items purchased within a budget. No unexpected errors were encountered, and the solution passed all tests successfully.

    [Task]:
        Give me Chocolate

        Anushka wants to buy chocolates.there are many chocolates in front of her, tagged with their prices.

        Anushka has only a certain amount to spend, and she wants to maximize the number of chocolates she buys with this money.

        Given a list of prices and an amount to spend, what is the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy? 

        For example, 

        if prices =[1,2,3,4]
        and Anushka has k=7 to spend, she can buy items [1,2,3] for 6 , or [3,4] for 7 units of currency. she would choose the first group of 3 items.

        Input Format

        The first line contains two integers, n and k , the number of priced chocolates and the amount Anushka has to spend.

        The next line contains n space-separated integers prices[i]

        Constraints

        1<= n <= 105

        1<= k <= 109

        1<= prices[i] <= 109



        A chocolate can't be bought multiple times.

        Output Format

        An integer that denotes the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy for her.

        Sample Input

        7 50

        1 12 5 111 200 1000 10

        Sample Output

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
           Anushka wants to buy as many chocolates as possible with a limited amount of money. Each chocolate has a specific price, and she needs to figure out how many chocolates she can buy without exceeding her budget.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
           - First, we will sort the list of chocolate prices in ascending order. This way, we can start buying the cheapest chocolates first, maximizing the number of chocolates Anushka can buy.
           - Then, we will iterate through the sorted list of prices, keeping track of the total amount spent and the number of chocolates bought. We will stop when adding another chocolate would exceed her budget.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function max_chocolates(n, k, prices):
               sort prices in ascending order
               total_spent = 0
               chocolates_bought = 0
       
               for price in prices:
                   if total_spent + price <= k:
                       total_spent += price
                       chocolates_bought += 1
                   else:
                       break
       
               return chocolates_bought

           read n and k
           read prices
           result = max_chocolates(n, k, prices)

INFO - [Task id] 238 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine the maximum profit that can be made from buying and selling a stock, given that we can perform at most two transactions. A transaction consists of buying a stock and then selling it later. We cannot buy stocks again until we have sold the previous ones.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will maintain two arrays to keep track of the maximum profit we can achieve with one transaction and two transactions. The idea is to iterate through the prices and calculate the maximum profit for each day, considering both the first and second transactions. We will keep track of the minimum price seen so far to calculate potential profits.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function maxProfit(prices):
       if prices is empty:
           return 0
       
       n = length of prices
       first_profit = array of size n initialized to 0
       second_profit = array of size n initialized to 0
       
       min_price = prices[0]
       for i from 1 to n-1:
           min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])
           first_profit[i] = max(first_profit[i-1], prices[i] - min_price)

       for i from 0 to n-1:

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine the maximum profit that can be made from buying and selling a stock, given that we can perform at most two transactions. A transaction consists of buying a stock and then selling it later. We cannot buy stocks again until we have sold the previous ones.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will maintain two arrays to keep track of the maximum profit we can achieve with one transaction and two transactions. The idea is to iterate through the prices and calculate the maximum profit for each day, considering both the first and second transactions. We will keep track of the minimum price seen so far to calculate potential profits.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function maxProfit(prices):
       if prices is empty:
           return 0
       
       n = length of prices
       first_profit = array of size n initialized to 0
       second_profit = array of size n initialized to 0

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note:Â You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:


Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Â             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

Example 2:


Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Â             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
Â             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.


Example 3:


Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.

    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 238 [generation text] The problem involved calculating the maximum profit from stock prices with the constraint of performing at most two transactions. The key concepts tested were dynamic programming and the management of state through arrays to track profits from one and two transactions.

The solution utilized two arrays: `first_profit` to store the maximum profit achievable with one transaction up to each day, and `second_profit` to store the maximum profit achievable with two transactions. The approach involved iterating through the prices to update these arrays based on the minimum and maximum prices encountered, allowing for efficient profit calculations.

The final implementation successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was effective. The code is structured to first calculate profits for the first transaction, then for the second, and finally combines the results to find the maximum profit. This method efficiently handles the constraints and provides the correct output. 

Here is the final code snippet for reference:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if not prices:
            return 0
        
        n = len(prices)
        first_profit = [0] * n
        second_profit = [0] * n
        
        min_price = prices[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])
            first_profit[i] = max(first_profit[i - 1], prices[i] - min_price)
        
        max_price = prices[n - 1]
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])
            second_profit[i] = max(second_profit[i + 1], max_price - prices[i])
        
        max_profit = 0
        for i in range(n):
            max_profit = max(max_profit, first_profit[i] + second_profit[i])
        
        return max_profit
``` 

This experience reinforced the importance of dynamic programming in optimizing solutions for problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure properties.

INFO - [Task id] 238 [generation text] The official solution to the problem of maximizing profit from stock transactions is insightful and provides a clear approach to solving the problem efficiently. Here are the key takeaways and insights from the official solution:

1. **Two-Pass Approach**: The solution employs a two-pass strategy. The first pass calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved from a single transaction after each day, while the second pass calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved from a single transaction before each day. This allows for the combination of profits from two transactions.

2. **Right Maximum Profits Array**: The `rmax_profits` array is used to store the maximum profit that can be achieved from a single transaction starting from each day to the end. This is computed by iterating backward through the prices and keeping track of the maximum price seen so far (`rmax`). This allows for efficient profit calculation for future days.

3. **Left Minimum Price Tracking**: In the second pass, the solution keeps track of the minimum price seen so far (`lmin`) as it iterates forward through the prices. This helps in calculating the maximum profit that can be achieved from a transaction that ends on the current day.

4. **Combining Profits**: The total profit is calculated by combining the maximum profit from the first transaction (up to the current day) and the maximum profit from the second transaction (after the current day). This is done in a single loop, ensuring that the solution remains efficient.

5. **Time Complexity**: The overall time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of days (length of the prices array). This is efficient compared to other potential solutions that may involve nested loops.

6. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also O(n) due to the additional array used to store the right maximum profits.

In summary, the official solution effectively breaks down the problem into manageable parts, leveraging a two-pass approach to efficiently calculate the maximum profit from at most two transactions. This method is both time-efficient and easy to understand, making it a strong solution to the problem.

INFO - [Task id] 238 [generation text] This function calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved from at most two transactions of buying and selling stocks, given a list of stock prices. It first checks if the prices list is empty and returns zero if so. It then initializes two arrays to keep track of the maximum profit from one and two transactions. The function iterates through the prices to compute the maximum profit for the first transaction and then does a reverse iteration to compute the maximum profit for the second transaction. Finally, it combines the profits from both transactions to determine the overall maximum profit. The result is returned as an integer value representing the maximum profit possible.

[Problem]
    Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

    Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

    Note:Â You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

    Example 1:


    Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
    Â             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

    Example 2:


    Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
    Â             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
    Â             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.


    Example 3:


    Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
