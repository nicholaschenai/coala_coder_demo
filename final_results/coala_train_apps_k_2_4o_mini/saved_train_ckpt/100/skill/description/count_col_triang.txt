[description for function: count_col_triang]
This function organizes a list of points by their colors and calculates the number of non-collinear triangles that can be formed from points of the same color. It first groups the points based on their color and initializes counters for the total number of points, unique colors, and triangles. For each color, it checks all combinations of three points to determine if they are non-collinear using a determinant method. It keeps track of the count of triangles for each color and the total number of triangles across all colors. Finally, it identifies the color with the maximum number of triangles and returns a summary that includes the total points, unique colors, total triangles, and the color with the maximum triangles along with its count. If no triangles can be formed, it returns an empty list for the color with the maximum triangles.

This knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to analyze geometric properties of points in a plane, particularly in computational geometry, computer graphics, or data visualization. It can help in understanding how to count specific configurations (like triangles) based on certain attributes (like color) and can be applied in various fields such as game development, simulations, and even in data analysis where visual representation of data points is required. Additionally, it can be beneficial in educational contexts for teaching concepts related to combinatorics and geometry.
