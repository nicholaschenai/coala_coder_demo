    "summary": "The problem involved finding the length of the shortest contiguous subarray with a sum of at least \\( K \\). The solution utilized a combination of prefix sums and a deque to efficiently track the indices of potential starting points for valid subarrays. The key concepts included maintaining a running sum and dynamically adjusting the window size based on the conditions of the sum relative to \\( K \\).\n\nThe approach was effective, as it allowed for a linear traversal of the array while keeping track of the minimum length of valid subarrays. The use of a deque ensured that we could efficiently manage the indices of prefix sums, allowing for quick updates and checks. The final implementation successfully passed the provided test cases, confirming its correctness.\n\nThe final code snippet is as follows:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestSubarray(self, A: list[int], K: int) -> int:\n        from collections import deque\n        \n        prefix_sum = [0] * (len(A) + 1)\n        for i in range(len(A)):\n            prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + A[i]\n        \n        min_length = float('inf')\n        dq = deque()\n        \n        for i in range(len(prefix_sum)):\n            while dq and prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[dq[0]] >= K:\n                min_length = min(min_length, i - dq.popleft())\n            \n            while dq and prefix_sum[dq[-1]] >= prefix_sum[i]:\n                dq.pop()\n            \n            dq.append(i)\n        \n        return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1\n```\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of using efficient data structures like deques for maintaining order and optimizing search operations in problems involving contiguous subarrays.",
    "reflection": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach using a combination of cumulative sums and a deque to track potential starting points for valid subarrays. Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Cumulative Sum**: The solution maintains a running cumulative sum (`cum_sum`) of the elements in the array. This allows for quick calculations of subarray sums by subtracting the cumulative sum at the start index from the cumulative sum at the end index.\n\n2. **Deque for Indices**: A deque is used to store pairs of indices and their corresponding cumulative sums. This helps in efficiently finding the shortest subarray that meets the sum requirement. The deque is maintained in such a way that it only contains indices that could potentially lead to a valid subarray.\n\n3. **Handling Positive and Negative Values**: \n   - When encountering a positive value, the solution checks if the current cumulative sum minus the smallest cumulative sum in the deque meets or exceeds \\( K \\). If it does, it updates the result with the length of the subarray and removes the starting index from the deque.\n   - For negative values, the solution removes indices from the end of the deque that have cumulative sums greater than or equal to the current cumulative sum, as they cannot contribute to a shorter valid subarray.\n\n4. **Final Result**: After processing all elements, the solution checks if a valid subarray was found (i.e., if the result is less than or equal to the length of the array). If not, it returns -1.\n\nThis approach is efficient, with a time complexity of \\( O(N) \\), where \\( N \\) is the length of the input array, due to the amortized constant time operations of the deque. In contrast, my initial approach was less efficient and did not account for the nuances of handling negative numbers and maintaining the deque properly.\n\nOverall, the official solution's use of cumulative sums and a deque provides a clear and effective method for solving the problem, highlighting the importance of data structures in optimizing algorithms.",
    "desc": "\n[description]\nThe function calculates the length of the shortest contiguous subarray within a given list that has a sum of at least K. It first constructs a prefix sum array to facilitate quick sum calculations of subarrays. A deque is used to efficiently track indices of the prefix sums while iterating through them. As it processes each prefix sum, it checks if the difference between the current sum and the smallest sum in the deque meets or exceeds K, updating the minimum length accordingly. The function ensures that the deque maintains an increasing order of prefix sums to optimize the search for valid subarrays. Finally, it returns the minimum length found or -1 if no such subarray exists.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to analyze subarrays of numerical data to find specific conditions, such as the shortest subarray that meets a certain sum requirement. This can be applicable in various fields such as finance for analyzing stock prices, in data analysis for finding trends, or in algorithm design for optimizing performance in problems involving arrays. It can also be beneficial in competitive programming and coding interviews where such problems are common."
