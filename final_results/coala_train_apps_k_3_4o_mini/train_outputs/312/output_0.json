    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to find the shortest contiguous subarray within a given list of integers such that the sum of the elements in that subarray is at least a specified value \\( K \\). If no such subarray exists, we should return -1.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach combined with prefix sums. We will maintain a running sum of the elements as we iterate through the array. If the running sum meets or exceeds \\( K \\), we will check the length of the current subarray and update our minimum length if it's shorter than previously found lengths. If the running sum is less than \\( K \\), we will continue to expand the window by adding more elements. If we find a valid subarray, we will return its length; otherwise, we will return -1.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Initialize a variable to store the minimum length of subarray found (set to infinity)\n   Initialize a variable to store the current sum (set to 0)\n   Initialize a deque to store the indices of the prefix sums\n\n   For each index in the array:\n       Add the current element to the current sum\n       While the current sum is greater than or equal to K:\n           Update the minimum length if the current subarray is shorter\n           Remove the leftmost index from the deque (to shrink the window)\n       Append the current index to the deque\n\n   If the minimum length is still infinity, return -1\n   Otherwise, return the minimum length\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def shortestSubarray(self, A: list[int], K: int) -> int:\n        from collections import deque\n        \n        # Initialize the prefix sum array and the deque\n        prefix_sum = [0] * (len(A) + 1)\n        for i in range(len(A)):\n            prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + A[i]\n        \n        min_length = float('inf')  # To store the minimum length found\n        dq = deque()  # Deque to store indices of the prefix sums\n        \n        # Iterate through the prefix sums\n        for i in range(len(prefix_sum)):\n            # While the current sum minus the smallest prefix sum in the deque is at least K\n            while dq and prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[dq[0]] >= K:\n                min_length = min(min_length, i - dq.popleft())  # Update the minimum length\n            \n            # Maintain the deque in increasing order of prefix sums\n            while dq and prefix_sum[dq[-1]] >= prefix_sum[i]:\n                dq.pop()\n            \n            dq.append(i)  # Add the current index to the deque\n        \n        # If min_length was updated, return it; otherwise, return -1\n        return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1\n```",
