The solution utilized a two-pointer technique (or sliding window approach) to efficiently calculate the number of subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers and then derived the count of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers by subtracting the counts for `k` and `k-1`.\n\n    Key concepts tested included:\n    - Understanding of subarrays and their properties.\n    - Efficient counting techniques using sliding windows to avoid nested loops, which would be inefficient for larger arrays.\n\n    The implemented solution was effective, and the helper function `count_at_most_k_odds` successfully counted the valid subarrays. The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:\n        \n            def count_at_most_k_odds(nums, k):\n                left = 0\n                count = 0\n                odd_count = 0\n                for right in range(len(nums)):\n                    if nums[right] % 2 == 1:  # Check if the number is odd\n                        odd_count += 1\n                    while odd_count > k:  # If we have more than k odd numbers\n                        if nums[left] % 2 == 1:  # Check if the number at left is odd\n                            odd_count -= 1\n                        left += 1\n                    count += (right - left + 1)  # Count the number of valid subarrays\n                return count\n        \n            return count_at_most_k_odds(nums, k) - count_at_most_k_odds(nums, k - 1)\n    ```\n\n    This approach proved to be efficient and effective, passing all test cases without errors. The experience reinforced the importance of using optimal algorithms for counting problems in arrays.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted array of integers. The problem was approached using a dynamic programming technique, which is a common strategy for problems involving subsequences. The key concept was to maintain an array `d` where each element represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends at that index.\n\n    The solution involved iterating through the input list and comparing each element with all previous elements to determine if they could form an increasing subsequence. If they could, the length of the subsequence was updated accordingly. The final result was obtained by finding the maximum value in the `d` array.\n\n    The implemented code was as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n            if not nums:\n                return 0\n        \n            n = len(nums)\n            d = [1] * n\n        \n            for i in range(1, n):\n                for j in range(i):\n                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n            return max(d)\n    ```\n\n    This approach successfully passed the provided test case, demonstrating its correctness. The dynamic programming method is efficient for this problem, operating in O(n^2) time complexity, which is suitable given the constraints. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of dynamic programming in solving subsequence-related problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element by its index any number of times. The key insight was that the total sum of the sequence must be less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, and it must also be non-negative to reach zero.\n\n    Initially, the solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it could always be made zero. This was a flawed assumption because it did not account for the possibility of the total sum being negative, which would make it impossible to reach zero.\n\n    The corrected approach involved:\n    1. Calculating the total sum of the sequence.\n    2. Calculating the maximum reduction possible using the formula for the sum of the first `N` natural numbers.\n    3. Checking both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction and must be non-negative.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total_sum = sum(A)\n            max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))\n        \n            if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    can_make_good_sequence(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all conditions that affect the outcome, especially when dealing with sums and reductions.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This allows for quick calculations of subarray sums by subtracting the cumulative sum at the start index from the cumulative sum at the end index.\n\n2. **Deque for Indices**: A deque is used to store pairs of indices and their corresponding cumulative sums. This helps in efficiently finding the shortest subarray that meets the sum requirement. The deque is maintained in such a way that it only contains indices that could potentially lead to a valid subarray.\n\n3. **Handling Positive and Negative Values**: \n   - When encountering a positive value, the solution checks if the current cumulative sum minus the smallest cumulative sum in the deque meets or exceeds \\( K \\). If it does, it updates the result with the length of the subarray and removes the starting index from the deque.\n   - For negative values, the solution removes indices from the end of the deque that have cumulative sums greater than or equal to the current cumulative sum, as they cannot contribute to a shorter valid subarray.\n\n4. **Final Result**: After processing all elements, the solution checks if a valid subarray was found (i.e., if the result is less than or equal to the length of the array). If not, it returns -1.\n\nThis approach is efficient, with a time complexity of \\( O(N) \\), where \\( N \\) is the length of the input array, due to the amortized constant time operations of the deque.
