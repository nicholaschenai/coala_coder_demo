    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We have a tree structure with N vertices, where each vertex has an integer value associated with it. For each vertex from 1 to N, we need to find the longest increasing subsequence of the integers along the shortest path from vertex 1 to that vertex.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will first represent the tree using an adjacency list. We will then perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from vertex 1 to find the shortest path to each vertex. As we traverse the tree, we will collect the values of the vertices along the path and compute the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) for that path. The LIS can be computed using a dynamic programming approach.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function longestIncreasingSubsequence(sequence):\n       if sequence is empty:\n           return 0\n       \n       n = length of sequence\n       d = array of size n initialized to 1\n       \n       for i from 1 to n-1:\n           for j from 0 to i-1:\n               if sequence[j] < sequence[i]:\n                   d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n       \n       return max value in d\n\n   function dfs(vertex, parent):\n       add vertex value to current path\n       for each neighbor of vertex:\n           if neighbor is not parent:\n               dfs(neighbor, vertex)\n       calculate LIS for current path\n       remove vertex value from current path\n\n   function main():\n       read N\n       read values a\n       read edges to build adjacency list\n       for k from 1 to N:\n           call dfs(1, -1) to find LIS from vertex 1 to k\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef longestIncreasingSubsequence(sequence):\n    # Check if the sequence is empty\n    if not sequence:\n        return 0\n    \n    n = len(sequence)  # Get the length of the sequence\n    d = [1] * n  # Initialize the dp array with 1s\n    \n    # Iterate through the sequence to fill the dp array\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        for j in range(i):\n            # If the current number is greater than the previous number\n            if sequence[j] < sequence[i]:\n                # Update the dp value for the current index\n                d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n    \n    # The length of the longest increasing subsequence is the max value in d\n    return max(d)\n\ndef dfs(vertex, parent, graph, values, current_path, results):\n    # Add the current vertex value to the path\n    current_path.append(values[vertex - 1])\n    \n    # Calculate the LIS for the current path\n    results[vertex] = longestIncreasingSubsequence(current_path)\n    \n    # Explore neighbors\n    for neighbor in graph[vertex]:\n        if neighbor != parent:  # Avoid going back to the parent\n            dfs(neighbor, vertex, graph, values, current_path, results)\n    \n    # Backtrack: remove the current vertex value from the path\n    current_path.pop()\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])  # Read number of vertices\n    values = list(map(int, data[1].split()))  # Read vertex values\n    graph = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]  # Create adjacency list\n    \n    # Read edges and build the graph\n    for i in range(2, N + 1):\n        u, v = map(int, data[i].split())\n        graph[u].append(v)\n        graph[v].append(u)\n    \n    results = [0] * (N + 1)  # To store results for each vertex\n    current_path = []  # To store the current path values\n    \n    # Start DFS from vertex 1\n    dfs(1, -1, graph, values, current_path, results)\n    \n    # Print results for vertices 1 to N\n    for k in range(1, N + 1):\n        print(results[k])\n\n```",
