The process involves repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements from the sequence until only one number remains.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - First, we need to compute the last digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers. However, since N can be as large as 10^18, we cannot compute all Fibonacci numbers directly.\n   - We can observe that the last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers due to a property known as Pisano period. Therefore, we only need to compute the last digits for the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.\n   - Once we have the last digits, we can simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one number remains. This can be done efficiently by using the properties of binary representation, as the last remaining index can be derived from the highest power of 2 less than or equal to N.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function last_remaining_fibonacci_digit(N):\n       # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers\n       last_digits = [0, 1]\n       for i from 2 to 59:\n           last_digits[i] = (last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10\n       \n       # Find the effective index in the last_digits array\n       effective_index = (N - 1) % 60\n       \n       # Return the last digit corresponding to the effective index\n       return last_digits[effective_index]\n\n   function main():\n       read T\n       for each test case:\n           read N\n           print last_remaining_fibonacci_digit(N)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef last_remaining_fibonacci_digit(N):\n    # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers\n    last_digits = [0, 1]\n    for i in range(2, 60):\n        last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)\n    \n    # Find the effective index in the last_digits array\n    effective_index = (N - 1) % 60\n    \n    # Return the last digit corresponding to the effective index\n    return last_digits[effective_index]\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        N = int(data[i])  # Read each N\n        results.append(last_remaining_fibonacci_digit(N))  # Compute result for each N\n    \n    # Print all results, one per line\n    sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n```"

Initially, I attempted to derive a formula for the series but mistakenly used an incorrect formula that did not correspond to the series, leading to incorrect outputs.\n\n    Upon analyzing the series, I identified that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, which led to the realization that the N'th term could be computed as the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares. The correct formula for the N'th term is:\n    - T(N) = (N-1) * N * (2(N-1) + 1) / 6\n\n    This formula was derived from the known formula for the sum of squares. After implementing this corrected formula, the code produced the expected results for all test cases.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(N):\n        if N == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1) // 6\n\n    def main():\n        T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N\n            result = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            print(result)  # Output the result\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring that the derived formulas are correct before implementation.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        The chef is trying to solve some series problems, Chef wants your help to code it.

Initially, I attempted to derive a formula for the series but mistakenly used an incorrect formula that did not correspond to the series, leading to incorrect outputs.\n\n    Upon analyzing the series, I identified that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, which led to the realization that the N'th term could be computed as the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares. The correct formula for the N'th term is:\n    - T(N) = (N-1) * N * (2(N-1) + 1) / 6\n\n    This formula was derived from the known formula for the sum of squares. After implementing this corrected formula, the code produced the expected results for all test cases.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(N):\n        if N == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1) // 6\n\n    def main():\n        T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N\n            result = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            print(result)  # Output the result\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring that the derived formulas are correct before implementation.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        The chef is trying to solve some series problems, Chef wants your help to code it.

The solution involved identifying the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N, calculating the number of terms in the series of multiples of 10, and then using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to compute the result efficiently.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to work with arithmetic series and integer division to find multiples. The approach was straightforward: determine the largest multiple of 10, count how many multiples exist up to that point, and apply the sum formula. This method is efficient and avoids any potential issues with large numbers, as Python handles large integers natively.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, and the code was structured to read input, process each test case, and output results correctly. The key takeaway is the importance of understanding arithmetic series and how to leverage mathematical formulas for efficient computation, especially when dealing with potentially large inputs. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):\n        largest_multiple = (N // 10) * 10\n        number_of_terms = largest_multiple // 10\n        sum = (number_of_terms * (10 + largest_multiple)) // 2\n        return sum\n\n    def main():\n        T = int(input())\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)\n            print(result)\n\n    main()\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the value of mathematical insights in programming challenges, particularly in optimizing solutions for large input sizes.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

It calculates the position of the last remaining number directly using the length of the binary representation, which corresponds to powers of 2. This insight allows it to determine the last remaining number in constant time after the initial setup, whereas my solution involved iterative filtering, which could be computationally expensive.\n\n3. **Key Steps in the Official Solution**:\n   - Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.\n   - For each test case, determine the effective index using the binary representation of \\(N\\) to find the last remaining number without simulating the entire filtering process.\n\nOverall, the official solution is more efficient and elegant, utilizing mathematical properties and precomputation to handle the problem constraints effectively.
