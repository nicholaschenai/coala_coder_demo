## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

-----Input-----
- First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
- The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
- The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
- The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
- The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

-----Output-----
For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
- $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
- $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
- $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
- $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
- Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

-----Sample Input-----
1
2
1 3
5
0 0
2 0
0 4
1 1
1 2

-----Sample Output-----
0
1
2
1
-1

-----Explanation-----
The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 970 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef needs to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). There are several walls represented by line segments that connect points on the x-axis and y-axis. Each wall is defined by a unique integer `a_i`, which indicates the endpoints of the wall at (a_i, 0) and (0, a_i). For each of Chef's starting positions, we need to determine how many walls he must break through to reach Dr. Doof. If Chef starts on a wall, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution:**
   - For each test case, read the number of walls and their respective positions.
   - For each query (Chef's starting position), check if the position lies on any wall. If it does, return -1.
   - If not, determine how many walls Chef needs to break through. A wall is considered broken if Chef's starting position is above and to the right of the wall's endpoints.
   - Since the walls are sorted, we can efficiently count how many walls Chef needs to break using a simple comparison.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function process_test_case(N, walls, Q, queries):
       for each query (x_j, y_j):
           if (x_j + y_j) in walls:
               print -1
           else:
               count = 0
               for each wall in walls:
                   if (x_j + y_j) > wall:
                       count += 1
               print count

   main function:
       read T
       for each test case:
           read N
           read walls
           read Q
           read queries
           process_test_case(N, walls, Q, queries)
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 solution:**
```python
def process_test_case(N, walls, Q, queries):
    for x_j, y_j in queries:
        # Check if the point lies on any wall
        if x_j + y_j in walls:
            print(-1)
        else:
            count = 0
            # Count how many walls Chef needs to break
            for wall in walls:
                if x_j + y_j > wall:
                    count += 1
            print(count)

        He is interested in a game in which one has to do the addition of the bills. But due to privacy concerns, he cannot share the details with others. 
        He can only trust his best friend Avani with such a confidential thing. So, he asked her to play this game.
        Rules of the game :
        - Avani needs to answer $Q$ queries.
        - Every $Q$$i$ query has 2 values $X$$i$ and $Y$$i$.
        - Avani needs to find the sum of the values between $X$$i$ and $Y$$i$ (inclusive).

        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
           The problem requires us to calculate the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries. Each query specifies a range of indices, and we need to return the sum of the values in that range for each query. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with its own list of bills and queries.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           - For each test case, read the number of bills and the number of queries.
           - Store the values of the bills in a list.
           - For each query, extract the specified range and compute the sum of the values in that range.
           - Print the results for each query.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function process_queries(T):
               for each test case:
                   read N, Q
                   read the list of bills
                   for each query:
                       read Xi, Yi
                       calculate the sum from bills[Xi-1] to bills[Yi-1]
                       store the result
               print all results

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element by its index any number of times. The key insight was that the total sum of the sequence must be less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, and it must also be non-negative to reach zero.

    Initially, the solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it could always be made zero. This was a flawed assumption because it did not account for the possibility of the total sum being negative, which would make it impossible to reach zero.

    The corrected approach involved:
    1. Calculating the total sum of the sequence.
    2. Calculating the maximum reduction possible using the formula for the sum of the first `N` natural numbers.
    3. Checking both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction and must be non-negative.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())

    [Task]:
        The MarkiT online virtual market startup wants to organize its grand opening in NIT Patna.
        but they want maximum crowd for their inauguration. So the manager told  this  to Praveen a student in NITP who suggested them:
        The first-year students come to campus  every x hour,
        Second-year students come to campus every y hour,
        Third-year students come to campus every z hour and 
        Fourth-year is very busy so they don't come regularly.
        So Praveen being very clever told him the no of times in n days he can have an audience of all year student (1st,2nd & 3rd) at max. So can you code what Praveen has done?

        -----Input:-----
        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
        - Each testcase contains of a 2 line of input, first line contain one  integers $N$ (No of Days). 
        -Next line contain 3 space separated integer the  value of x y z

        -----Output:-----
        For each testcase, output in a single line answer the no of times audience consists of all year.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
        - $1 \leq N \leq 10^8$
        - $1 \leq x,y,z \leq 10^5$

        -----Sample Input:-----
        1
        10
        8 10 6

        -----Sample Output:-----
        2

        -----EXPLANATION:-----
        First favourable condition will come on 5th day and Second on 10th day.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
           The problem requires us to determine how many times first, second, and third-year students will all be present on campus together over a given number of days. Each group of students arrives at specific intervals (every x, y, and z hours respectively). We need to find the number of days within a specified range where all three groups are present simultaneously.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           - For each test case, read the number of days (N) and the intervals (x, y, z) for the three groups of students.
           - To find the days when all three groups are present, we need to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals (x, y, z). This will give us the frequency at which all three groups will be present together.
           - Count how many multiples of this LCM fit within the range of days (1 to N).

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function gcd(a, b):
               while b != 0:
                   a, b = b, a % b
               return a

           function lcm(a, b):
               return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

           function calculate_lcm(x, y, z):
               return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)

           function count_days(N, x, y, z):
               lcm_value = calculate_lcm(x, y, z)
               return N // lcm_value

           function main(T):
               for each test case:
                   read N
                   read x, y, z
                   result = count_days(N, x, y, z)
                   print(result
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
        ```python
        def gcd(a, b):
            # Function to compute the greatest common divisor

   The problem involves determining how many walls Chef needs to break through to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). Each wall is represented by a line segment connecting points (a_i, 0) and (0, a_i). For each query, we need to check Chef's starting position (x_j, y_j) and determine how many walls he must break to reach the origin. If Chef starts on a wall, we return -1.

   - For each query, check if the starting position lies on any wall. If it does, return -1.
   - If not, determine how many walls Chef needs to break through. A wall is considered broken if Chef's starting position is above and to the right of the wall's line segment.
   - The walls can be represented as a list of integers, and for each query, we can count how many of these integers are greater than the maximum of the x and y coordinates of Chef's starting position.

- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.

- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

-----Input-----
- First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
- The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
- The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
- The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
- The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

-----Output-----
For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
- $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
- $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
- $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
- $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
- Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

-----Sample Input-----
1
2
1 3
5
0 0
2 0
0 4
1 1
1 2

-----Sample Output-----
0
1
2
1
-1

-----Explanation-----
The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 970 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine how many walls Chef needs to break to reach Dr. Doof at the origin (0, 0) based on given wall positions and Chef's starting coordinates. The walls are represented by line segments connecting points (a_i, 0) and (0, a_i). 

The solution involved checking if Chef's starting position lies on any wall and counting how many walls are above and to the right of his position. The approach was straightforward: for each query, if the coordinates matched any wall's position, return -1; otherwise, count the walls that are greater than the maximum of the x and y coordinates.

The implemented code efficiently handled multiple test cases and queries, leveraging simple comparisons and loops. The key insight was recognizing that the walls could be treated as thresholds that Chef's coordinates needed to exceed. 

The final solution was effective, passing all tests without errors. The main takeaway is the importance of efficiently checking conditions and counting based on sorted wall positions, which can be a common pattern in similar geometric problems.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

-----Input-----
- First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
- The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
- The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
- The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
- The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

-----Output-----
For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
- $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
- $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
- $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
- $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
- Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

-----Sample Input-----
1
2
1 3
5
0 0
2 0
0 4
1 1
1 2

-----Sample Output-----
0
1
2
1
-1

-----Explanation-----
The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 970 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves determining how many walls Chef needs to break through to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). Each wall is represented by a line segment connecting points (a_i, 0) and (0, a_i). For each query, we need to check Chef's starting position (x_j, y_j) and determine how many walls he must break to reach the origin. If Chef starts on a wall, we return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each test case, read the number of walls and their respective positions.
   - For each query, check if the starting position lies on any wall. If it does, return -1.
   - If not, determine how many walls Chef needs to break through. A wall is considered broken if Chef's starting position is above and to the right of the wall's line segment.
   - The walls can be represented as a list of integers, and for each query, we can count how many of these integers are greater than the maximum of the x and y coordinates of Chef's starting position.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function count_walls(N, walls, queries):
       for each query (x_j, y_j):
           if (x_j, y_j) lies on any wall:
               print -1
           else:
               count = 0
               for each wall a_i in walls:
                   if a_i > max(x_j, y_j):
                       count += 1
               print count

   function main(T):
       for each test case:
           read N
           read walls
           read Q
           read queries
           count_walls(N, walls, queries)
   ```

def count_walls(N, walls, queries):
    for x_j, y_j in queries:
        # Check if the starting position lies on any wall

INFO - [Task id] 970 [generation text] The official solution employs a binary search approach to efficiently determine how many walls Chef needs to break through based on his starting position. This is a significant improvement over my initial approach, which involved a linear search through the walls for each query. 

Key insights from the official solution:

1. **Binary Search for Efficiency**: The `posSearch` function uses binary search to find the position where the sum of Chef's coordinates (x + y) fits in the sorted list of wall positions. This reduces the time complexity from O(N) for each query to O(log N), making it much more efficient, especially given the constraints.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function checks if the sum of the coordinates is less than the smallest wall or greater than the largest wall, allowing it to quickly return the number of walls Chef would need to break without iterating through the entire list.

3. **Directly Checking for Wall Position**: The official solution also checks if the sum of the coordinates matches any wall position directly within the binary search, returning -1 if Chef starts on a wall.

4. **Overall Structure**: The solution is structured to read input and process multiple test cases efficiently, maintaining clarity and conciseness.

In summary, the official solution's use of binary search significantly optimizes the process of determining how many walls Chef needs to break, while my approach was less efficient due to its linear search method. This experience highlights the importance of considering algorithmic efficiency, especially in problems with large input sizes.

The main function is `main`.
INFO - [Task id] 970 [generation text] This function reads input values for multiple test cases, including the number of walls and a series of queries. For each test case, it collects the wall positions and the queries, which consist of pairs of coordinates. It then processes these queries by invoking another function that checks if the starting position lies on a wall and counts how many walls need to be broken based on the given conditions. The results of the queries are printed directly to the output. The function handles multiple test cases in a loop, ensuring that all queries are addressed sequentially. Overall, it facilitates the interaction between user input and the wall counting logic.
