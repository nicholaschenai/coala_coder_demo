    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The problem involves determining how many walls Chef needs to break through to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). Each wall is represented by a line segment connecting points (a_i, 0) and (0, a_i). For each query, we need to check Chef's starting position (x_j, y_j) and determine how many walls he must break to reach the origin. If Chef starts on a wall, we return -1.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   - For each test case, read the number of walls and their respective positions.\n   - For each query, check if the starting position lies on any wall. If it does, return -1.\n   - If not, determine how many walls Chef needs to break through. A wall is considered broken if Chef's starting position is above and to the right of the wall's line segment.\n   - The walls can be represented as a list of integers, and for each query, we can count how many of these integers are greater than the maximum of the x and y coordinates of Chef's starting position.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_walls(N, walls, queries):\n       for each query (x_j, y_j):\n           if (x_j, y_j) lies on any wall:\n               print -1\n           else:\n               count = 0\n               for each wall a_i in walls:\n                   if a_i > max(x_j, y_j):\n                       count += 1\n               print count\n\n   function main(T):\n       for each test case:\n           read N\n           read walls\n           read Q\n           read queries\n           count_walls(N, walls, queries)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_walls(N, walls, queries):\n    for x_j, y_j in queries:\n        # Check if the starting position lies on any wall\n        if x_j == y_j and x_j in walls:\n            print(-1)\n            continue\n        \n        count = 0\n        # Count how many walls Chef needs to break\n        for a_i in walls:\n            if a_i > max(x_j, y_j):\n                count += 1\n        print(count)\n\ndef main():\n    T = int(input())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        walls = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        Q = int(input())\n        queries = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(Q)]\n        count_walls(N, walls, queries)\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n```",
