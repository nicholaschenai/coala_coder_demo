    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   We have a collection of rocks, each with a positive integer weight. When we smash two rocks together, if they have the same weight, both are destroyed. If they have different weights, the lighter rock is destroyed, and the heavier rock's weight is reduced by the weight of the lighter rock. The goal is to determine the smallest possible weight of the remaining rock after performing all possible smashes.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: \n   The problem can be approached using dynamic programming. The idea is to consider the weights of the rocks as a set of integers and find a way to partition these weights into two groups such that the difference between the sums of the two groups is minimized. This is akin to the \"subset sum problem\" where we want to find a subset of weights that can be summed to a value as close to half of the total weight as possible. The smallest possible weight of the remaining rock will be the absolute difference between the total weight and twice the sum of the closest subset to half of the total weight.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function lastStoneWeightII(stones):\n       total_weight = sum(stones)\n       target = total_weight // 2\n       dp = array of size (target + 1) initialized to False\n       dp[0] = True  // We can always form the sum 0\n\n       for each stone in stones:\n           for j from target down to stone:\n               dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]\n\n       for j from target down to 0:\n           if dp[j] is True:\n               return total_weight - 2 * j\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python Solution**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Calculate the total weight of all stones\n        total_weight = sum(stones)\n        # The target is half of the total weight\n        target = total_weight // 2\n        # Create a DP array to track achievable weights\n        dp = [False] * (target + 1)\n        dp[0] = True  # We can always form the sum 0\n\n        # Iterate through each stone\n        for stone in stones:\n            # Update the DP array from back to front\n            for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):\n                dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]\n\n        # Find the largest j such that dp[j] is True\n        for j in range(target, -1, -1):\n            if dp[j]:\n                # The minimum possible weight of the last stone\n                return total_weight - 2 * j\n```",
