## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within D days.
The i-th package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i].Â  Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within D days.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed. 

Example 2:
Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], D = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
1st day: 3, 2
2nd day: 2, 4
3rd day: 1, 4

Example 3:
Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], D = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: 
1st day: 1
2nd day: 2
3rd day: 3
4th day: 1, 1

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to determine the minimum weight capacity of a ship that can transport a series of packages within a specified number of days. The packages must be loaded in the order they are given, and the total weight loaded each day cannot exceed the ship's capacity.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach. The idea is to find the minimum capacity that allows us to ship all packages within the given number of days. We will set the lower bound of our search to the maximum weight of a single package (since the ship must be able to carry at least the heaviest package) and the upper bound to the total weight of all packages (which would be the capacity if we shipped everything in one day). We will then check if a given capacity can ship all packages within the allowed days by simulating the loading process.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function shipWithinDays(weights, D):
       set left to max(weights)  // minimum possible capacity
       set right to sum(weights)  // maximum possible capacity
       
       while left < right:
           set mid to (left + right) // 2
           if canShip(weights, mid, D):
               set right to mid  // try for a smaller capacity
           else:
               set left to mid + 1  // increase capacity
       
       return left  // this is the minimum capacity that works

   function canShip(weights, capacity, D):
       set days to 1
       set currentWeight to 0
       
       for weight in weights:
           if currentWeight + weight > capacity:
               increment days
               set currentWeight to weight  // start new day with this package
           else:
               add weight to currentWeight
       
       return days <= D  // check if we can ship within D days
   ```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the problems created by his setters, the number of problems needed for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the available days to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging simple loops and arithmetic.

    The final implementation was clean and efficient, successfully passing all provided test cases. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all edge cases (like having fewer problems than needed for a single contest) are considered. The solution was implemented without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints given. 

    Hereâs the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def max_contests(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    max_contests(T)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of clear problem understanding and systematic solution development.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of determining the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock after a series of smashes, I identified that the core concept revolves around partitioning the weights of the rocks. The goal is to minimize the difference between two groups of weights, which can be approached using dynamic programming.

    The strategy involved calculating the total weight of the rocks and then using a dynamic programming array to track achievable sums up to half of the total weight. By iterating through each rock and updating the DP array, I was able to determine the largest sum that could be formed without exceeding the target. The final result is derived from the total weight minus twice this sum.

    The implemented solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating that the approach of using dynamic programming to solve a subset sum-like problem was effective. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
            total_weight = sum(stones)
            target = total_weight // 2
            dp = [False] * (target + 1)
            dp[0] = True

            for stone in stones:
                for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):
                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]

            for j in range(target, -1, -1):
                if dp[j]:
                    return total_weight - 2 * j
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in problems and applying dynamic programming techniques to optimize solutions.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively simplifies the problem by directly calculating the total number of problems and determining how many contests can be formed in a straightforward manner. The key steps are:

    1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it captures the number of setters (N), the number of problems required for a contest (K), and the number of days available (D).
    2. **Problem Summation**: It computes the total number of problems created by summing the list of problems from each setter.
    3. **Contest Calculation**: It calculates the maximum number of contests that can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required for each contest.
    4. **Final Output**: It prints the minimum of the contests possible and the days available, ensuring that the output respects the constraints of the problem.

    The official solution is concise and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for input and summation, which keeps the code clean and readable. 

    One insight from this experience is the importance of directly addressing the problem constraints in a clear manner. The official solution does this effectively by using a single line to compute the number of contests and another to print the result, which is both efficient and easy to understand. 

    Overall, the approach I took was similar, but the official solution's brevity and clarity highlight the effectiveness of straightforward calculations in competitive programming.

   We need to determine the minimum weight capacity of a ship that can transport a series of packages within a specified number of days. Each package has a specific weight, and the ship can only carry a certain maximum weight each day. The packages must be loaded in the order they are given.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach. The idea is to find the minimum weight capacity that allows us to ship all packages within the given number of days. We will set the lower bound of our search to the maximum weight of a single package (since the ship must be able to carry at least the heaviest package) and the upper bound to the total weight of all packages (which would be the capacity if we shipped everything in one day). We will then check for each mid-point capacity if it is possible to ship all packages within the allowed days. If it is possible, we will try a smaller capacity; if not, we will increase the capacity.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function shipWithinDays(weights, D):
       set left to max(weights)  // minimum possible capacity
       set right to sum(weights)  // maximum possible capacity

       while left < right:
           set mid to (left + right) // 2
           if canShip(weights, mid, D):
               right = mid  // try for a smaller capacity
           else:
               left = mid + 1  // increase capacity

       return left  // this is the minimum capacity that works

   function canShip(weights, capacity, D):
       set days to 1
       set currentWeight to 0

       for weight in weights:
           if currentWeight + weight > capacity:
               days += 1
               currentWeight = weight  // start a new day
           else:

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] The problem involved determining the minimum weight capacity of a ship required to transport packages within a specified number of days, adhering to the order of the packages. The solution utilized a binary search approach, which is efficient for this type of optimization problem.

Key concepts included:
- **Binary Search**: This was used to find the minimum capacity by setting bounds based on the maximum single package weight and the total weight of all packages.
- **Greedy Strategy**: A helper function was implemented to check if a given capacity could ship all packages within the allowed days by iterating through the weights and counting the days needed.

The final implementation successfully passed the provided test cases, confirming the effectiveness of the binary search combined with a greedy check for capacity. The code structure was clear, with a main function for the binary search and a helper function to validate the shipping capacity.

The solution is as follows:
```python
class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: list[int], D: int) -> int:
        left = max(weights)
        right = sum(weights)

        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if self.canShip(weights, mid, D):
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1

        return left

    def canShip(self, weights: list[int], capacity: int, D: int) -> bool:
        days = 1
        currentWeight = 0

        for weight in weights:
            if currentWeight + weight > capacity:
                days += 1
                currentWeight = weight
            else:
                currentWeight += weight

        return days <= D
```
This experience reinforced the importance of combining different algorithmic strategies to solve complex problems efficiently.

            else:
                right = mid
        return left

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] The official solution effectively utilizes a binary search approach to determine the minimum ship capacity required to transport packages within a specified number of days. The key insights from the official solution include:

1. **Initial Bounds**: The lower bound (`left`) is set to the maximum weight of a single package, ensuring that the ship can at least carry the heaviest package. The upper bound (`right`) is calculated as the total weight divided by the number of days, which provides a reasonable estimate of the maximum capacity needed.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The solution iteratively narrows down the possible capacities by checking the midpoint (`mid`). If the current capacity can accommodate the packages within the allowed days, it attempts a smaller capacity; otherwise, it increases the capacity.

3. **Counting Days**: The inner loop counts how many days are needed to ship the packages with the current capacity. If the number of days exceeds `D`, it indicates that the capacity is too low, prompting an increase in the lower bound.

4. **Efficiency**: The use of binary search significantly reduces the number of checks needed compared to a linear search, making the solution efficient even for larger inputs.

Overall, the official solution is concise and effectively balances clarity with performance. My initial approach was similar but could have benefited from a more precise upper bound calculation and a clearer day-counting mechanism. The official solution's method of calculating the upper bound as `left * len(weights) // D` is particularly insightful, as it directly relates the capacity to the number of packages and days, ensuring a more accurate starting point for the search.

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] The function determines the minimum shipping capacity required to transport a list of package weights within a specified number of days. It uses a binary search approach, setting the initial bounds based on the maximum single package weight and the total weight of all packages. During the search, it checks if a given capacity allows for shipping all packages within the allowed days. If shipping is possible with the current capacity, it attempts to find a smaller capacity; otherwise, it increases the capacity. The process continues until the optimal capacity is found, which is then returned. Ultimately, it provides the minimum capacity needed to meet the shipping deadline.

[Problem]
    A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within D days.
    The i-th package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i].Â  Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
    Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within D days.
Â 
    Example 1:
    Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
    Output: 15
    Explanation: 
    A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
    1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    2nd day: 6, 7
    3rd day: 8
    4th day: 9
    5th day: 10

    Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed. 

    Example 2:
    Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], D = 3
    Output: 6
    Explanation: 
    A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
    1st day: 3, 2
    2nd day: 2, 4
    3rd day: 1, 4

    Example 3:
    Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], D = 4
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 
    1st day: 1
    2nd day: 2
    3rd day: 3
    4th day: 1, 1

Â 
    Constraints:

    1 <= D <= weights.length <= 50000
    1 <= weights[i] <= 500

            days = 1  # Start with one day
            currentWeight = 0  # Current weight loaded on the ship

            for weight in weights:
                if currentWeight + weight > capacity:
                    days += 1  # Need a new day
                    currentWeight = weight  # Start loading the new day with this weight
                else:
                    currentWeight += weight  # Continue loading the current day

            return days <= D  # Check if we can ship within the allowed days
