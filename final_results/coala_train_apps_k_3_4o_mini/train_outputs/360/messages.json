The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the available days to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging simple loops and arithmetic.\n\n    The final implementation was clean and efficient, successfully passing all provided test cases. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all edge cases (like having fewer problems than needed for a single contest) are considered. The solution was implemented without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints given. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_contests(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    max_contests(T)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of clear problem understanding and systematic solution development.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In solving the problem of determining the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock after a series of smashes, I identified that the core concept revolves around partitioning the weights of the rocks. The goal is to minimize the difference between two groups of weights, which can be approached using dynamic programming.\n\n    The strategy involved calculating the total weight of the rocks and then using a dynamic programming array to track achievable sums up to half of the total weight. By iterating through each rock and updating the DP array, I was able to determine the largest sum that could be formed without exceeding the target. The final result is derived from the total weight minus twice this sum.\n\n    The implemented solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating that the approach of using dynamic programming to solve a subset sum-like problem was effective. The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:\n            total_weight = sum(stones)\n            target = total_weight // 2\n            dp = [False] * (target + 1)\n            dp[0] = True\n\n            for stone in stones:\n                for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):\n                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]\n\n            for j in range(target, -1, -1):\n                if dp[j]:\n                    return total_weight - 2 * j\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in problems and applying dynamic programming techniques to optimize solutions.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution effectively simplifies the problem by directly calculating the total number of problems and determining how many contests can be formed in a straightforward manner. The key steps are:\n\n    1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it captures the number of setters (N), the number of problems required for a contest (K), and the number of days available (D).\n    2. **Problem Summation**: It computes the total number of problems created by summing the list of problems from each setter.\n    3. **Contest Calculation**: It calculates the maximum number of contests that can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required for each contest.\n    4. **Final Output**: It prints the minimum of the contests possible and the days available, ensuring that the output respects the constraints of the problem.\n\n    The official solution is concise and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for input and summation, which keeps the code clean and readable. \n\n    One insight from this experience is the importance of directly addressing the problem constraints in a clear manner. The official solution does this effectively by using a single line to compute the number of contests and another to print the result, which is both efficient and easy to understand. \n\n    Overall, the approach I took was similar, but the official solution's brevity and clarity highlight the effectiveness of straightforward calculations in competitive programming.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The upper bound (`right`) is calculated as the total weight divided by the number of days, which provides a reasonable estimate of the maximum capacity needed.\n\n2. **Binary Search Logic**: The solution iteratively narrows down the possible capacities by checking the midpoint (`mid`). If the current capacity can accommodate the packages within the allowed days, it attempts a smaller capacity; otherwise, it increases the capacity.\n\n3. **Counting Days**: The inner loop counts how many days are needed to ship the packages with the current capacity.
