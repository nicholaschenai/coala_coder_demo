This approach is particularly beneficial when the number of students (N) is large, but the number of questions (M) is relatively small, as it avoids unnecessary updates to students who do not have their scores modified.\n\n    Key insights from the official solution:\n\n    1. **Use of Dictionary**: Instead of initializing a list of scores for all students, the solution uses a dictionary (`d`) to store scores only for students who are affected by the questions. This reduces memory usage and potentially speeds up score updates.\n\n    2. **Score Initialization**: The dictionary is populated with an initial score of 10 for each student affected by a question, ensuring that only relevant students are initialized.\n\n    3. **Efficient Score Update**: The solution iterates over the range of affected students twice: first to initialize their scores and then to apply the complexity multiplier. This avoids unnecessary multiplications for students who are not affected by any questions.\n\n    4. **Final Score Calculation**: After processing all questions, the total score is calculated by summing the values in the dictionary, and the mean score is computed by dividing by the total number of students (N).\n\n    5. **Error Handling**: The use of a try-except block allows the program to handle unexpected input gracefully, although it may obscure specific errors.\n\n    Overall, the official solution is more efficient in terms of both time and space complexity, especially for larger inputs, as it minimizes the number of operations performed on unaffected students. This experience highlights the importance of considering data structures that can optimize performance based on the problem constraints.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

This is similar to my approach, where I also read the input in a structured way.\n\n2. **Range Sum Calculation**: The official solution uses a nested loop to calculate the sum for each query by iterating through the specified range. While this is a valid approach, it can be inefficient for large inputs, as it results in a time complexity of O(Q * N) in the worst case. My solution also followed this method, which could lead to performance issues with the upper limits of the constraints.\n\n3. **Modulo Operation**: The official solution includes a modulo operation (`% 1000000000`) to ensure that the sum does not exceed a certain limit. This is a good practice when dealing with potentially large sums, although the problem statement did not explicitly require it.\n\n4. **Efficiency Considerations**: Both my solution and the official one could benefit from a more efficient approach, such as using prefix sums to preprocess the list of bills. This would allow for O(1) sum queries after an O(N) preprocessing step, significantly improving performance for large inputs.\n\nIn summary, while the official solution is correct and straightforward, it highlights the need for efficiency in handling large datasets.
