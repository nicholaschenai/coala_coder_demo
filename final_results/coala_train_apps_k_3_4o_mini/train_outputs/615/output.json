    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The problem requires us to calculate the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries. Each query specifies a range of indices, and we need to return the sum of the values in that range for each query. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with its own list of bills and queries.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   - For each test case, read the number of bills and the number of queries.\n   - Store the values of the bills in a list.\n   - For each query, extract the specified range and compute the sum of the values in that range.\n   - Print the results for each query.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function process_queries(T):\n       for each test case:\n           read N, Q\n           read the list of bills\n           for each query:\n               read Xi, Yi\n               calculate the sum from bills[Xi-1] to bills[Yi-1]\n               store the result\n       print all results\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef process_queries(T):\n    for _ in range(T):\n        # Read number of bills (N) and number of queries (Q)\n        N, Q = map(int, input().split())\n        \n        # Read the list of bills\n        bills = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n        # Process each query\n        results = []\n        for __ in range(Q):\n            # Read the range for the query\n            Xi, Yi = map(int, input().split())\n            # Calculate the sum from Xi to Yi (inclusive)\n            total_sum = sum(bills[Xi-1:Yi])  # Convert to 0-based index\n            results.append(total_sum)\n        \n        # Print all results for the current test case\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n# Read number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nprocess_queries(T)\n```",
