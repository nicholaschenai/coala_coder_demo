## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays fromÂ the array and then sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2Â numbers.
Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in theÂ new array.Â Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
Output: 13 
Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10
Output: 50

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
nums.length == n
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
1 <= left <= rightÂ <= n * (n + 1) / 2

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

[Summary]:
    The problem involved counting the number of continuous subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers in a given array of integers. The solution utilized a two-pointer technique (or sliding window approach) to efficiently calculate the number of subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers and then derived the count of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers by subtracting the counts for `k` and `k-1`.

    Key concepts tested included:
    - Understanding of subarrays and their properties.
    - Efficient counting techniques using sliding windows to avoid nested loops, which would be inefficient for larger arrays.

    The implemented solution was effective, and the helper function `count_at_most_k_odds` successfully counted the valid subarrays. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
        
            def count_at_most_k_odds(nums, k):
                left = 0
                count = 0
                odd_count = 0
                for right in range(len(nums)):
                    if nums[right] % 2 == 1:  # Check if the number is odd
                        odd_count += 1
                    while odd_count > k:  # If we have more than k odd numbers
                        if nums[left] % 2 == 1:  # Check if the number at left is odd
                            odd_count -= 1
                        left += 1
                    count += (right - left + 1)  # Count the number of valid subarrays
                return count
        
            return count_at_most_k_odds(nums, k) - count_at_most_k_odds(nums, k - 1)
    ```

    This approach proved to be efficient and effective, passing all test cases without errors. The experience reinforced the importance of using optimal algorithms for counting problems in arrays.

    ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience

    In attempting to solve the problem of calculating the sum of Fibonacci numbers from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \), I initially approached it using matrix exponentiation, which is a common technique for efficiently computing Fibonacci numbers. However, my solution faced issues with the formula used for summing the Fibonacci numbers, leading to incorrect outputs for certain test cases.

    The official solution provided a more nuanced approach that leverages both the properties of Fibonacci numbers and modular arithmetic. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

    1. **Fibonacci Calculation**: The official solution uses a recursive method to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently. The function `_fib(n)` computes Fibonacci numbers using a divide-and-conquer approach, which is more efficient than the matrix exponentiation method I used. This method reduces the time complexity significantly by breaking down the problem recursively.

    2. **Modular Arithmetic**: The official solution consistently applies modular arithmetic to ensure that the results remain within bounds, which is crucial given the constraints of the problem. This is done using a modulus value of \( 10^9 + 7 \).

    3. **Sum Calculation**: The official solution includes a `brute` function that calculates the sum of Fibonacci numbers multiplied by powers of \( k \). This is a different approach than my initial attempt, which focused solely on the range of Fibonacci numbers without considering the multiplicative factor of \( k \).

    4. **Final Answer Calculation**: The `ans` function in the official solution combines the results of the Fibonacci calculations and applies the modular inverse to ensure the final result is computed correctly. This step is crucial for handling cases where division is involved in modular arithmetic.

    ### Key Code Snippets from the Official Solution
    - **Fibonacci Calculation**:
        ```python
        def _fib(n):
            if n == 0:
                return (0, 1)
            else:
                a, b = _fib(n // 2)
                c = (a * (b * 2 - a)) % mod
                d = (a * a + b * b) % mod
                if n % 2 == 0:
                    return (c, d)
                else:
                    return (d, c + d)
        ```

    - **Sum Calculation**:
        ```python
        def ans(n, k):
            k %= mod
            a = pow(k, n + 1, mod)
            b = (a * k) % mod
            x = a * (fibonacci(n + 1)) + b * fibonacci(n) - k
            y = inv((k * k + k - 1) % mod)
            return ((x * y) % mod + mod) % mod
        ```

    ### Conclusion
    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the mathematical properties of the problem and how they can be leveraged to create efficient algorithms. The official solution's use of recursive Fibonacci calculation and modular arithmetic provided a more effective approach than my initial attempt. In future problems, I will pay closer attention to the mathematical foundations and consider multiple approaches to ensure robustness in my solutions.

[Summary]:
    The problem involved calculating the sum of squares of terms in the Golomb sequence for given ranges across multiple test cases. The Golomb sequence is defined recursively, which posed a challenge due to the potential size of the indices (up to \(10^{10}\)). 

    The key strategy was to use memoization to store previously computed values of the Golomb sequence to avoid redundant calculations. This approach allowed for efficient retrieval of values during the summation process. The recurrence relation \(G_{n+1} = 1 + G_{n + 1 - G_{G_n}}\) was utilized to compute the sequence values on-the-fly.

    The final implementation involved a main function to handle input and output, a `sum_of_squares` function to compute the required sums, and a `golomb` function to calculate individual Golomb numbers with memoization. The solution successfully handled the constraints and passed the provided test cases.

    Hereâs the core code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def golomb(n, memo):
        if n in memo:
            return memo[n]
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        memo[n] = 1 + golomb(n - golomb(golomb(n - 1, memo), memo), memo)
        return memo[n]

    def sum_of_squares(L, R):
        memo = {}
        total_sum = 0
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        for i in range(L, R + 1):
            g_i = golomb(i, memo)
            total_sum = (total_sum + g_i * g_i) % mod
        return total_sum
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of memoization in recursive problems, especially when dealing with large input sizes.

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to calculate the sum of all non-empty continuous subarrays of a given array of positive integers. After calculating these sums, we need to sort them and return the sum of a specific range of these sorted sums, defined by two indices (left and right). The result should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays fromÂ the array and then sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2Â numbers.
Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in theÂ new array.Â Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
Output: 13 
Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10
Output: 50

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
nums.length == n
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
1 <= left <= rightÂ <= n * (n + 1) / 2

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] The problem involved calculating the sum of all non-empty continuous subarrays from a given array of positive integers, sorting these sums, and then returning the sum of a specified range of these sorted sums. The solution required generating all possible subarray sums, sorting them, and then summing the elements within the specified indices.

Key concepts tested included:
- Generating subarrays and calculating their sums efficiently.
- Sorting a list of integers.
- Handling 1-based indexing when summing the specified range.

The implemented solution successfully calculated the required sums and passed the provided test cases. The approach involved nested loops to generate subarray sums, which is straightforward but could be optimized for larger inputs. The final code snippet is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def rangeSum(self, nums: list[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        subarray_sums = []
        for i in range(n):

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] The official solution employs a more efficient approach using prefix sums and binary search, which significantly optimizes the process of calculating subarray sums compared to the brute-force method I initially implemented. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Prefix Sums**: The solution constructs two prefix sum arrays, `B` and `C`. The array `B` holds the cumulative sums of the original array `A`, while `C` holds the cumulative sums of `B`. This allows for quick calculations of subarray sums without needing to iterate through the array multiple times.

2. **Counting Subarray Sums**: The function `count_sum_under(score)` uses a two-pointer technique to count how many subarray sums are less than or equal to a given score. This is more efficient than sorting all subarray sums, as it avoids the need to store and sort all possible sums explicitly.

3. **Binary Search for K-th Score**: The function `kth_score(k)` uses binary search to find the k-th smallest subarray sum. This is a crucial optimization that allows the solution to efficiently determine the sums needed for the final result.

4. **Final Calculation**: The result is computed by finding the difference between the sums of subarray sums up to the right index and the left index, leveraging the previously computed sums.

Overall, the official solution is more efficient in both time and space complexity, particularly for larger input sizes, as it avoids the need to generate and sort all subarray sums explicitly. This experience highlights the importance of considering alternative approaches, such as prefix sums and binary search, to optimize performance in problems involving cumulative calculations.

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] This function calculates the sum of all continuous subarray sums within a specified range defined by two indices, left and right. It first computes the sums of all possible subarrays from the given list of integers. After generating these sums, it sorts them in ascending order. The function then sums the values from the sorted list between the specified left and right indices, adjusting for 1-based indexing. Finally, it returns the total sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure the result fits within standard numerical limits.

[Problem]
    Given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays fromÂ the array and then sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2Â numbers.
    Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in theÂ new array.Â Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
Â 
    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
    Output: 13 
    Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 

    Example 2:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.

    Example 3:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10
    Output: 50

Â 
    Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
    nums.length == n
    1 <= nums[i] <= 100
    1 <= left <= rightÂ <= n * (n + 1) / 2
