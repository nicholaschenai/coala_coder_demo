The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.\n$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. \nThat means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').\nIt is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.\n\n-----Input:-----Input:\n- \nFirst line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- \nThe first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. \n- \nThen $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.\n- \nThen $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.\n\n-----Output:-----Output:\nFor each testcase,print the scoreboard.\nThat means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order\n\n-----Constraints-----Constraints\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10$\n- $1 \\leq R \\leq N \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq ti \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq pi \\leq 10^6$\nSum of points ($pi$) of a team will not cross $10^9$.\n\n-----Sample Input:-----Sample Input:\n1\n10 5\namigoes  1\nbannermen 1\nmonarchy 4\noutliers 5\niniciador 10\naegimos 2\niiiacdnor 1\neilorstu 1\ngimosae 3\nmnachroy 7\n\n-----Sample Output:-----Sample Output:\niniciador 11\nmonarchy 11\namigoes 6\noutliers 6\nbannermen 1\n\n-----Explanation:-----Explanation:\n\n$It$ $is$ $assured$ $that$ $each$ $team$ $will$ $submit$ $once$ $within$ $first$ $half$ $an$ $hour$.That means -                                          \n\nthat kind of submissions isn't possible within first half an hour.\nDataset can be huge.

        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   Teacher Sungjae is organizing a programming competition and has a list of team submissions. Each team has a unique name, but the order of characters in the name does not matter (e.g., \"abc\" is the same as \"cba\"). After collecting scores from the teams, he wants to create a scoreboard that lists the teams and their total scores. The scoreboard should be sorted first by score in descending order, and if two teams have the same score, they should be sorted by their names in alphabetical order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - Read the number of test cases.\n   - For each test case, read the number of total submissions and the number of submissions in the first half hour.\n   - Create a dictionary to store the total scores for each team, using a normalized version of the team name (sorted characters of the name) as the key.\n   - For the first half hour submissions, directly add the scores to the corresponding team in the dictionary.\n   - For the remaining submissions, normalize the team names and add the scores to the corresponding team in the dictionary.\n   - Once all scores are collected, sort the teams first by score (in descending order) and then by name (in alphabetical order).\n   - Print the sorted results.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function main():\n       read T\n       for each test case from 1 to T:\n           read N, R\n           create an empty dictionary scores\n           for i from 1 to R:\n               read team_name, points\n               add points to scores[team_name]\n           for i from 1 to (N - R):\n               read scrambled_team_name, points\n               normalized_name = sort(scrambled_team_name)\n               add points to scores[normalized_name]\n           sorted_teams = sort(scores.items(), by score descending, then by name ascending)\n           for team, score in sorted_teams:\n               print team, score\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R\n        index += 1\n        scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores\n        \n        # Read the first R submissions\n        for _ in range(R):\n            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on the last space\n            team_name = line[0]\n            points = int(line[1])\n            scores[team_name] = scores.get(team_name, 0) + points\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Read the remaining N-R submissions\n        for _ in range(N - R):\n            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on the last space\n            scrambled_team_name = line[0]\n            points = int(line[1])\n            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(scrambled_team_name))  # Normalize the team name\n            scores[normalized_name] = scores.get(normalized_name, 0) + points\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Sort teams by score (descending) and then by name (ascending)\n        sorted_teams = sorted(scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n        \n        # Prepare results for this test case\n        for team, score in sorted_teams:\n            results.append(f\"{team} {score}\")\n    \n    # Print all results\n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\n# Call the main function to execute the solution\nmain()\n```"

Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:\n\n    1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of problems (`p`) and subtasks (`s`) in a single line, which is efficient and straightforward.\n\n    2. **Using a Dictionary for Grouping**: Instead of maintaining a list of tuples for difficulties, the official solution uses a dictionary (`scores`) where the keys are the difficulty scores and the values are lists of problem indices. This allows for efficient grouping and retrieval of problems with the same difficulty.\n\n    3. **Score Calculation**: The solution pairs scores with the number of contestants who solved them using a dictionary (`nsc`). It then sorts the scores and counts the number of valid indices where the number of contestants decreases. This is done using a simple loop that compares adjacent scores.\n\n    4. **Sorting and Output**: After calculating the scores, the solution sorts the keys of the dictionary and then constructs a final list of problem indices in the correct order. This two-step sorting (first by score, then by problem index) ensures that the output meets the problem's requirements.\n\n    5. **Efficiency**: The use of dictionaries and sorting operations is efficient given the constraints, and the overall complexity remains manageable even for the upper limits of the input sizes.\n\n    Overall, the official solution is insightful in its use of data structures to simplify the problem and ensure clarity in the logic. The approach of grouping by difficulty and then sorting is particularly effective for this type of problem.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to determine the difficulty of programming problems based on their subtasks, which involved calculating how many times the number of contestants solving a subtask decreases as we sort the subtasks by their scores. The solution involved reading input data, processing it to count the valid indices, and then sorting the problems based on their calculated difficulty.\n\n    The core concepts tested in this problem included sorting, tuple manipulation, and counting conditions based on comparisons. The approach I took was to pair scores with the number of contestants, sort these pairs, and then count the valid indices where the number of contestants decreased. This method was efficient given the constraints, particularly since the number of subtasks (S) is relatively small (up to 30), allowing for straightforward comparisons.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was sound, as evidenced by passing the provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution was straightforward without any significant complications. The key takeaway is the importance of careful data structuring and sorting when dealing with problems that require comparative analysis. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_difficulty(P, S):\n        difficulties = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, P + 1):\n            scores = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            contestants = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n            paired = sorted(zip(scores, contestants))\n        \n            count = 0\n            for k in range(1, S):\n                if paired[k - 1][1] > paired[k][1]:\n                    count += 1\n        \n            difficulties.append((count, i))\n    \n        difficulties.sort()\n    \n        for difficulty in difficulties:\n            print(difficulty[1])\n\n    P, S = map(int, input().split())\n    calculate_difficulty(P, S)\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Mandarin chinese\n        , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n        Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).\n        The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:\n        - Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.\n        - Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.\n        - Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.\n        - For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.\n        You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.\n\n        -----Input-----\n        - The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.\n        - $2P$ lines follow.

The difficulty of a problem is defined by counting how many times the number of contestants who solved a subtask decreases as we look at subtasks sorted by their scores.

We need to ensure that we are correctly aggregating scores for teams based on their names, regardless of the order of characters.\n\n2. **Identifying the Mistakes**:\n   - In the previous solution, I used `sorted_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))` to create a key for the scores dictionary. This is correct for grouping teams with the same characters, but I did not maintain the original team names for output.\n   - When sorting the results, I only sorted by the sorted name and score, which does not reflect the original team names. Instead, I should have stored the original team names alongside their scores.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong**:\n   - I did not keep track of the original team names associated with their sorted names. This means that when I printed the results, I was printing the sorted version of the team names instead of the original names.\n   - The output format was incorrect as it was not matching the expected output structure.\n\n4. **Correcting the Approach**:\n   - I need to maintain a mapping from the sorted team name to both the original team name and the score.\n   - When printing the results, I should ensure that I print the original team names instead of the sorted names.\n\nNow, let's implement the corrected solution:\n\n```python\ndef process_submissions():\n    T = int(input())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, R = map(int, input().split())\n        scores = {}\n        \n        # Process first R submissions\n        for _ in range(R):\n            line = input().split()\n            team_name = line[0]\n            points = int(line[1])\n            sorted_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))\n            if sorted_name not in scores:\n                scores[sorted_name] = (team_name, 0)  # Store original name and score\n            scores[sorted_name] = (scores[sorted_name][0], scores[sorted_name][1] + points)\n        \n        # Process remaining N-R submissions\n        for _ in range(N - R):\n            line = input().split()\n            team_name = line[0]\n            points = int(line[1])\n            sorted_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))\n            if sorted_name not in scores:\n                scores[sorted_name] = (team_name, 0)  # Store original name and score\n            scores[sorted_name] = (scores[sorted_name][0], scores[sorted_name][1] + points)\n        \n        # Sort teams by score (descending) and original name (lexicographically)\n        sorted_scores = sorted(scores.values(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n        \n        # Print the results\n        for team in sorted_scores:\n            print(team[0], team[1])\n\n# Read input and call the function\nprocess_submissions()\n``` \n\nIn this corrected version:\n- I store both the original team name and the accumulated score in the `scores` dictionary.\n- When sorting, I sort based on the score and then by the original team name.\n- The output now correctly reflects the original team names and their scores."

The solution involved reading input data, processing it to count the valid indices, and then sorting the problems based on their calculated difficulty.\n\n    The core concepts tested in this problem included sorting, tuple manipulation, and counting conditions based on comparisons. The approach I took was to pair scores with the number of contestants, sort these pairs, and then count the valid indices where the number of contestants decreased. This method was efficient given the constraints, particularly since the number of subtasks (S) is relatively small (up to 30), allowing for straightforward comparisons.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was sound, as evidenced by passing the provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution was straightforward without any significant complications. The key takeaway is the importance of careful data structuring and sorting when dealing with problems that require comparative analysis. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_difficulty(P, S):\n        difficulties = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, P + 1):\n            scores = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            contestants = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n            paired = sorted(zip(scores, contestants))\n        \n            count = 0\n            for k in range(1, S):\n                if paired[k - 1][1] > paired[k][1]:\n                    count += 1\n        \n            difficulties.append((count, i))\n    \n        difficulties.sort()\n    \n        for difficulty in difficulties:\n            print(difficulty[1])\n\n    P, S = map(int, input().split())\n    calculate_difficulty(P, S)\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to calculate the mean of maximum scores for students after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve, which are assigned to specific ranges of students based on their roll numbers.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the efficient updating of scores for a range of students based on multiple queries. The approach involved initializing a list of scores, iterating through each question, and updating the scores for the specified range. The final mean score was calculated by summing the scores and dividing by the number of students, using integer division to obtain the floor value.\n\n    The solution was implemented successfully without any errors, and the provided code snippet effectively handled the input and output requirements. The key takeaway was the importance of managing score updates efficiently, especially given the constraints where both the number of students and questions could be large (up to 100,000). The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_mean_scores(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, M = map(int, input().split())\n            scores = [10] * N\n            for _ in range(M):\n                i, j, k = map(int, input().split())\n                for student in range(i - 1, j):\n                    scores[student] *= k\n            total_score = sum(scores)\n            mean_score = total_score // N\n            print(mean_score)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    calculate_mean_scores(T)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements and efficiently managing data updates in programming challenges.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by utilizing a dictionary to group problems based on their calculated difficulty scores. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:\n\n    1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of problems (`p`) and subtasks (`s`) in a single line, which is efficient and straightforward.\n\n    2. **Using a Dictionary for Grouping**: Instead of maintaining a list of tuples for difficulties, the official solution uses a dictionary (`scores`) where the keys are the difficulty scores and the values are lists of problem indices. This allows for efficient grouping and retrieval of problems with the same difficulty.\n\n    3. **Score Calculation**: The solution pairs scores with the number of contestants who solved them using a dictionary (`nsc`). It then sorts the scores and counts the number of valid indices where the number of contestants decreases. This is done using a simple loop that compares adjacent scores.\n\n    4. **Sorting and Output**: After calculating the scores, the solution sorts the keys of the dictionary and then constructs a final list of problem indices in the correct order. This two-step sorting (first by score, then by problem index) ensures that the output meets the problem's requirements.\n\n    5. **Efficiency**: The use of dictionaries and sorting operations is efficient given the constraints, and the overall complexity remains manageable even for the upper limits of the input sizes.\n\n    Overall, the official solution is insightful in its use of data structures to simplify the problem and ensure clarity in the logic. The approach of grouping by difficulty and then sorting is particularly effective for this type of problem.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

This method was effective in handling the character order issue, but I overlooked the need to maintain the original team names for output, which led to incorrect results in the final output.\n\nThe official solution provided a more streamlined approach. It utilized a list to store scores and team names, initializing scores based on the maximum possible points (10^10) and then decrementing these scores based on the submissions. This method effectively avoided the need for sorting the team names separately, as it directly compared sorted names during the input processing phase. The final sorting was done based on the scores, which were adjusted to reflect the actual points earned.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n1. **Initialization of Scores**: The use of a large initial score (10^10) allowed for straightforward subtraction, simplifying the score aggregation process.\n2. **Direct Comparison**: By sorting team names immediately upon input and comparing them directly, the solution avoided the need for additional data structures to maintain original names.\n3. **Efficient Sorting**: The final sorting step was efficient, as it only required sorting the list of teams based on their adjusted scores.\n\nOverall, the official solution was more concise and efficient, demonstrating the importance of considering initialization strategies and direct comparisons in problem-solving.
