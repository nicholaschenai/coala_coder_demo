## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.

Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.

The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.

Each customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ â€” the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ â€” the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ â€” the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.

A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.

Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.


-----Input-----

Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $-10^9 \le m \le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.

Next, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^9$, $-10^9 \le l_i \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.

The customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Example-----
Input
4
3 0
5 1 2
7 3 5
10 -1 0
2 12
5 7 10
10 16 20
3 -100
100 0 0
100 -50 50
200 100 100
1 100
99 -100 0

Output
YES
NO
YES
NO



-----Note-----

In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. 

In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.

In the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 20 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Gildong runs a bulgogi restaurant and wants to ensure that all customers are satisfied with the temperature when they arrive. Each customer has a specific time they will arrive and a preferred temperature range. The restaurant has an air conditioner that can either heat, cool, or maintain the current temperature. The goal is to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature to meet the preferences of all customers based on their arrival times.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   We need to track the temperature range that can be achieved by the time each customer arrives. Starting from the initial temperature, we will calculate how much time has passed since the last customer and adjust the temperature range accordingly. For each customer, we will check if the current achievable temperature range overlaps with their preferred range. If it does, we will update the achievable range for the next customer based on the time until their arrival. If at any point the ranges do not overlap, we will conclude that it is impossible to satisfy all customers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function canSatisfyCustomers(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read n, m
           current_time = 0
           min_temp = m
           max_temp = m
           
           for each customer in test_case:
               t_i, l_i, h_i = customer
               time_passed = t_i - current_time
               
               # Update the temperature range based on time passed
               min_temp -= time_passed
               max_temp += time_passed
               
               # Update the achievable range to be within the customer's range
               min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)
               max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)
               
               # If the ranges do not overlap, it's impossible
               if min_temp > max_temp:
                   print("NO")
                   break
               
               current_time = t_i
           else:

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.

Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.

The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.

Each customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ â€” the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ â€” the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ â€” the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.

A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.

Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.


-----Input-----

Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $-10^9 \le m \le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.

Next, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^9$, $-10^9 \le l_i \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.

The customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Example-----
Input
4
3 0
5 1 2
7 3 5
10 -1 0
2 12
5 7 10
10 16 20
3 -100
100 0 0
100 -50 50
200 100 100
1 100
99 -100 0

Output
YES
NO
YES
NO



-----Note-----

In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. 

In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.

In the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money (K) to N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money, such that he ends up with exactly zero. The key insights were that if the total demand from all minions exceeds K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and if the total demand equals K, he can distribute the money exactly.

    Initially, I implemented a solution that simply checked if the total demand was greater than, equal to, or less than K. However, this approach failed to account for the scenario where the total demand was less than K but could still be distributed in a way that Gru ends up with zero. The logic needed to ensure that Gru could fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.

    The correct approach involves:
    1. Calculating the total demand.
    2. Checking if the total demand exceeds K (output "NO").
    3. If the total demand equals K, output "YES".
    4. If the total demand is less than K, output "NO" since Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.

    The final code snippet that captures this logic is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, input().split())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
            total_demand = sum(A)
        
            if total_demand > K:
                print("NO")
            elif total_demand == K:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    can_distribute_money(T)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the conditions under which money can be distributed and ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element by its index any number of times. The key insight was that the total sum of the sequence must be less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, and it must also be non-negative to reach zero.

    Initially, the solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it could always be made zero. This was a flawed assumption because it did not account for the possibility of the total sum being negative, which would make it impossible to reach zero.

    The corrected approach involved:
    1. Calculating the total sum of the sequence.
    2. Calculating the maximum reduction possible using the formula for the sum of the first `N` natural numbers.
    3. Checking both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction and must be non-negative.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
            total_sum = sum(A)
            max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))
        
            if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    can_make_good_sequence(T)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all conditions that affect the outcome, especially when dealing with sums and reductions.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the key concept revolves around understanding how two different methods of distributing apples into boxes can lead to different outcomes. The first candidate distributes apples evenly, while the second candidate can create uneven distributions by filling the box with the least apples. The critical insight is that if K (the number of boxes) is 1, both candidates will yield the same result, while for K greater than 1, the distributions can differ.

    The solution involves a straightforward conditional check on the value of K. If K equals 1, the output is "NO"; otherwise, it is "YES". This logic is efficient and works within the constraints provided, as it only requires a simple comparison for each test case.

    The final implementation reads the number of test cases and processes each case by checking the value of K, printing the appropriate response. The code is clean and efficient, handling the maximum constraints without any issues. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_apples(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, input().split())
            if K == 1:
                print("NO")
            else:
                print("YES")

    T = int(input())
    can_distribute_apples(T)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the implications of the problem constraints and how they affect the solution approach.

INFO - [Task id] 20 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Gildong runs a bulgogi restaurant and wants to ensure that the temperature is within the preferred range of all customers when they arrive. Each customer has a specific time they will arrive and a temperature range they prefer. The air conditioner can be set to heat, cool, or remain off, and the temperature changes accordingly. The task is to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature to satisfy all customers based on their arrival times and preferred temperature ranges.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   We need to track the temperature range that can be achieved at each customer's arrival time. Starting from the initial temperature, we will calculate how much time has passed since the last customer and adjust the temperature range accordingly. For each customer, we will check if the current achievable temperature range overlaps with their preferred range. If it does, we update the achievable range for the next customer. If at any point the ranges do not overlap, it means we cannot satisfy that customer, and we should return "NO" for that test case.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function can_satisfy_customers(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read n, m (number of customers, initial temperature)
           initialize current_time = 0
           initialize current_min_temp = m
           initialize current_max_temp = m
           
           for each customer in test_case:
               read t_i, l_i, h_i (arrival time, lower bound, upper bound)
               
               time_passed = t_i - current_time
               current_min_temp -= time_passed
               current_max_temp += time_passed
               
               update current_min_temp to max(current_min_temp, l_i)
               update current_max_temp to min(current_max_temp, h_i)
               
               if current_min_temp > current_max_temp:
                   print "NO"
                   break
               
               update current_time to t_i
           else:
               print "YES"
   ```

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Gildong runs a bulgogi restaurant and wants to ensure that the temperature is within the preferred range of all customers when they arrive.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.

Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.

The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.

Each customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ â€” the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ â€” the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ â€” the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.

A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.

Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.


-----Input-----

Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $-10^9 \le m \le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.

Next, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^9$, $-10^9 \le l_i \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.

The customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Example-----
Input
4
3 0
5 1 2
7 3 5
10 -1 0
2 12
5 7 10
10 16 20
3 -100
100 0 0
100 -50 50
200 100 100
1 100
99 -100 0

Output
YES
NO
YES
NO



-----Note-----

In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. 

In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.

In the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 20 [generation text] In this problem, the main challenge was to determine if the temperature in a restaurant could be adjusted to satisfy all customers based on their preferred temperature ranges and arrival times. The solution involved tracking the achievable temperature range at each customer's visit and ensuring it overlaps with their preferred range.

The core concept was to calculate the time elapsed since the last customer and adjust the current temperature range accordingly. This required careful management of the minimum and maximum temperatures that could be achieved at each step. If at any point the achievable range did not overlap with a customer's preferred range, it was clear that not all customers could be satisfied.

The implemented solution successfully handled multiple test cases and efficiently checked the conditions for each customer. The use of simple arithmetic operations and comparisons allowed for a straightforward implementation without the need for complex data structures or algorithms. The final code was clean and effective, passing all provided test cases without any issues. 

Key takeaway: Maintaining a dynamic range of possible temperatures based on time and customer preferences is crucial in solving similar problems involving constraints and conditions.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.

Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.

The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.

Each customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ â€” the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ â€” the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ â€” the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.

A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.

Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.


-----Input-----

Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $-10^9 \le m \le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.

Next, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^9$, $-10^9 \le l_i \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.

The customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Example-----
Input
4
3 0
5 1 2
7 3 5
10 -1 0
2 12
5 7 10
10 16 20
3 -100
100 0 0
100 -50 50
200 100 100
1 100
99 -100 0

Output
YES
NO
YES
NO



-----Note-----

In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. 

In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.

In the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 20 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Gildong runs a bulgogi restaurant and wants to ensure that the temperature is within the preferred range of all customers when they arrive. Each customer has a specific time they will arrive and a temperature range they prefer. The air conditioner can be set to heat, cool, or remain off, and the temperature changes accordingly. The task is to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature to satisfy all customers based on their arrival times and preferred temperature ranges.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   We need to track the temperature range that can be achieved at each customer's arrival time. Starting from the initial temperature, we will calculate how much time has passed since the last customer and adjust the temperature range accordingly. For each customer, we will check if the current achievable temperature range overlaps with their preferred range. If it does, we update the achievable range for the next customer. If at any point the ranges do not overlap, it means we cannot satisfy that customer, and we should return "NO" for that test case.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function can_satisfy_customers(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read n, m (number of customers, initial temperature)
           initialize current_time = 0
           initialize current_min_temp = m
           initialize current_max_temp = m
           
           for each customer in test_case:
               read t_i, l_i, h_i (arrival time, lower bound, upper bound)
               
               time_passed = t_i - current_time
               current_min_temp -= time_passed
               current_max_temp += time_passed
               
               update current_min_temp to max(current_min_temp, l_i)
               update current_max_temp to min(current_max_temp, h_i)
               
               if current_min_temp > current_max_temp:
                   print "NO"
                   break
               
               update current_time to t_i
           else:
               print "YES"

INFO - [Task id] 20 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem by maintaining a dynamic range of achievable temperatures as customers arrive. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:

1. **Initialization**: The solution starts by reading the number of test cases and initializing the current temperature range (`now`) to the initial temperature for both the minimum and maximum. It also keeps track of the current time.

2. **Iterating through Customers**: For each customer, the solution calculates the time elapsed since the last customer and adjusts the current temperature range accordingly. This is done by subtracting the elapsed time from the minimum temperature and adding it to the maximum temperature.

3. **Checking Overlap**: The solution checks if the adjusted temperature range overlaps with the customer's preferred range. If there is no overlap, it sets a flag to indicate that not all customers can be satisfied.

4. **Updating the Range**: If there is an overlap, the solution updates the current achievable temperature range to reflect the intersection of the current range and the customer's preferred range.

5. **Output**: After processing all customers, the solution outputs "YES" if all customers can be satisfied and "NO" otherwise.

### Key Takeaways:
- The approach of maintaining a dynamic range of temperatures is efficient and straightforward.
- The use of flags to track the possibility of satisfying all customers simplifies the logic.
- The solution effectively handles the constraints and edge cases by ensuring that the temperature adjustments are calculated based on the time elapsed.

This experience reinforces the importance of maintaining state and dynamically adjusting ranges in problems involving time and constraints, which is a common pattern in algorithmic challenges.

[Problem]
    Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.

    Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.

    The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.

    Each customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ â€” the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ â€” the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ â€” the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.

    A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.

    Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.


    -----Input-----

    Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.

    Next, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^9$, $-10^9 \le l_i \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.

    The customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.

    In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. 

    In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.

    In the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.
