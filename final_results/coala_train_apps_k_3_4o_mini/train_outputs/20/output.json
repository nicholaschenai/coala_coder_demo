    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   Gildong runs a bulgogi restaurant and wants to ensure that the temperature is within the preferred range of all customers when they arrive. Each customer has a specific time they will arrive and a temperature range they prefer. The air conditioner can be set to heat, cool, or remain off, and the temperature changes accordingly. The task is to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature to satisfy all customers based on their arrival times and preferred temperature ranges.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   We need to track the temperature range that can be achieved at each customer's arrival time. Starting from the initial temperature, we will calculate how much time has passed since the last customer and adjust the temperature range accordingly. For each customer, we will check if the current achievable temperature range overlaps with their preferred range. If it does, we update the achievable range for the next customer. If at any point the ranges do not overlap, it means we cannot satisfy that customer, and we should return \"NO\" for that test case.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function can_satisfy_customers(test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read n, m (number of customers, initial temperature)\n           initialize current_time = 0\n           initialize current_min_temp = m\n           initialize current_max_temp = m\n           \n           for each customer in test_case:\n               read t_i, l_i, h_i (arrival time, lower bound, upper bound)\n               \n               time_passed = t_i - current_time\n               current_min_temp -= time_passed\n               current_max_temp += time_passed\n               \n               update current_min_temp to max(current_min_temp, l_i)\n               update current_max_temp to min(current_max_temp, h_i)\n               \n               if current_min_temp > current_max_temp:\n                   print \"NO\"\n                   break\n               \n               update current_time to t_i\n           else:\n               print \"YES\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef can_satisfy_customers(q):\n    for _ in range(q):\n        # Read number of customers and initial temperature\n        n, m = map(int, input().split())\n        current_time = 0\n        current_min_temp = m\n        current_max_temp = m\n        \n        satisfied = True  # Flag to check if all customers can be satisfied\n        \n        for _ in range(n):\n            # Read each customer's visit time and preferred temperature range\n            t_i, l_i, h_i = map(int, input().split())\n            \n            # Calculate the time passed since the last customer\n            time_passed = t_i - current_time\n            \n            # Update the current temperature range based on time passed\n            current_min_temp -= time_passed\n            current_max_temp += time_passed\n            \n            # Update the current temperature range to fit the customer's preference\n            current_min_temp = max(current_min_temp, l_i)\n            current_max_temp = min(current_max_temp, h_i)\n            \n            # If the current temperature range is invalid, we cannot satisfy this customer\n            if current_min_temp > current_max_temp:\n                satisfied = False\n                break\n            \n            # Update the current time to the customer's visit time\n            current_time = t_i\n        \n        # Output the result for this test case\n        if satisfied:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nq = int(input())\ncan_satisfy_customers(q)\n```",
