The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.\n\nGildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.\n\nEach customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ \u2014 the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ \u2014 the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ \u2014 the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.\n\nA customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.\n\nGiven the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$, $-10^9 \\le m \\le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.\n\nNext, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \\le t_i \\le 10^9$, $-10^9 \\le l_i \\le h_i \\le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.\n\nThe customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n3 0\n5 1 2\n7 3 5\n10 -1 0\n2 12\n5 7 10\n10 16 20\n3 -100\n100 0 0\n100 -50 50\n200 100 100\n1 100\n99 -100 0\n\nOutput\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. \n\nIn the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.\n\nIn the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   Gildong runs a bulgogi restaurant and wants to ensure that all customers are satisfied with the temperature when they arrive. Each customer has a specific time they will arrive and a preferred temperature range. The restaurant has an air conditioner that can either heat, cool, or maintain the current temperature. The goal is to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature to meet the preferences of all customers based on their arrival times.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   We need to track the temperature range that can be achieved by the time each customer arrives. Starting from the initial temperature, we will calculate how much time has passed since the last customer and adjust the temperature range accordingly. For each customer, we will check if the current achievable temperature range overlaps with their preferred range. If it does, we will update the achievable range for the next customer based on the time until their arrival. If at any point the ranges do not overlap, we will conclude that it is impossible to satisfy all customers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function canSatisfyCustomers(test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read n, m\n           current_time = 0\n           min_temp = m\n           max_temp = m\n           \n           for each customer in test_case:\n               t_i, l_i, h_i = customer\n               time_passed = t_i - current_time\n               \n               # Update the temperature range based on time passed\n               min_temp -= time_passed\n               max_temp += time_passed\n               \n               # Update the achievable range to be within the customer's range\n               min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)\n               max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)\n               \n               # If the ranges do not overlap, it's impossible\n               if min_temp > max_temp:\n                   print(\"NO\")\n                   break\n               \n               current_time = t_i\n           else:\n               print(\"YES\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef canSatisfyCustomers(test_cases):\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        # Read number of customers and initial temperature\n        n, m = test_case[0]\n        current_time = 0\n        min_temp = m\n        max_temp = m\n        \n        # Iterate through each customer\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            t_i, l_i, h_i = test_case[i]\n            time_passed = t_i - current_time\n            \n            # Update the temperature range based on time passed\n            min_temp -= time_passed\n            max_temp += time_passed\n            \n            # Update the achievable range to be within the customer's range\n            min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)\n            max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)\n            \n            # If the ranges do not overlap, it's impossible\n            if min_temp > max_temp:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                break\n            \n            current_time = t_i\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# canSatisfyCustomers([\n#     [(3, 0), (5, 1, 2), (7, 3, 5), (10, -1, 0)],\n#     [(2, 12), (5, 7, 10), (10, 16, 20)],\n#     [(3, -100), (100, 0, 0), (100, -50, 50), (200, 100, 100)],\n#     [(1, 100), (99, -100, 0)]\n# ])\n```"

The key insights were that if the total demand from all minions exceeds K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and if the total demand equals K, he can distribute the money exactly.\n\n    Initially, I implemented a solution that simply checked if the total demand was greater than, equal to, or less than K. However, this approach failed to account for the scenario where the total demand was less than K but could still be distributed in a way that Gru ends up with zero. The logic needed to ensure that Gru could fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.\n\n    The correct approach involves:\n    1. Calculating the total demand.\n    2. Checking if the total demand exceeds K (output \"NO\").\n    3. If the total demand equals K, output \"YES\".\n    4. If the total demand is less than K, output \"NO\" since Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.\n\n    The final code snippet that captures this logic is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, input().split())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n            total_demand = sum(A)\n        \n            if total_demand > K:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            elif total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    can_distribute_money(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the conditions under which money can be distributed and ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element by its index any number of times. The key insight was that the total sum of the sequence must be less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, and it must also be non-negative to reach zero.\n\n    Initially, the solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it could always be made zero. This was a flawed assumption because it did not account for the possibility of the total sum being negative, which would make it impossible to reach zero.\n\n    The corrected approach involved:\n    1. Calculating the total sum of the sequence.\n    2. Calculating the maximum reduction possible using the formula for the sum of the first `N` natural numbers.\n    3. Checking both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction and must be non-negative.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total_sum = sum(A)\n            max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))\n        \n            if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    can_make_good_sequence(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all conditions that affect the outcome, especially when dealing with sums and reductions.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the key concept revolves around understanding how two different methods of distributing apples into boxes can lead to different outcomes. The first candidate distributes apples evenly, while the second candidate can create uneven distributions by filling the box with the least apples. The critical insight is that if K (the number of boxes) is 1, both candidates will yield the same result, while for K greater than 1, the distributions can differ.\n\n    The solution involves a straightforward conditional check on the value of K. If K equals 1, the output is \"NO\"; otherwise, it is \"YES\". This logic is efficient and works within the constraints provided, as it only requires a simple comparison for each test case.\n\n    The final implementation reads the number of test cases and processes each case by checking the value of K, printing the appropriate response. The code is clean and efficient, handling the maximum constraints without any issues. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_apples(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, input().split())\n            if K == 1:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    can_distribute_apples(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the implications of the problem constraints and how they affect the solution approach.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

For each test case, it reads the number of customers and the initial temperature, then iterates through each customer's visit time and temperature preferences. It adjusts the current temperature range based on the time elapsed since the last customer and checks if the updated range can accommodate the current customer's preferences. If at any point the temperature range becomes invalid, it marks the test case as unsatisfactory. Finally, it outputs \"YES\" if all customers can be satisfied or \"NO\" if any cannot. The function effectively manages the temperature adjustments and checks for each customer in sequence.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where a business needs to manage customer satisfaction based on specific conditions, such as temperature control in a restaurant. It can be applied to any situation where multiple customers have varying preferences that need to be accommodated within a limited timeframe. This could extend to other service industries where conditions must be adjusted to meet customer needs, such as hotels, event venues, or even transportation services where comfort levels are crucial."
