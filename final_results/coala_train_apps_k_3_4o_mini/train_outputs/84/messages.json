You are trying to push array elements to the stack in the order $s_1, s_2, s_3, \\dots s_{l}$. Moreover, if the stack is empty or the element at the top of this stack is not equal to the current element, then you just push the current element to the top of the stack. Otherwise, you don't push the current element to the stack and, moreover, pop the top element of the stack. \n\nIf after this process the stack remains empty, the array $s$ is considered stack exterminable.\n\nThere are samples of stack exterminable arrays:   $[1, 1]$;  $[2, 1, 1, 2]$;  $[1, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3]$;  $[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]$;  $[5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$; \n\nLet's consider the changing of stack more details if $s = [5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$ (the top of stack is highlighted).   after pushing $s_1 = 5$ the stack turn into $[\\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_2 = 1$ the stack turn into $[5, \\textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_3 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, 1, \\textbf{2}]$;  after pushing $s_4 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, \\textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_5 = 1$ the stack turn into $[\\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_6 = 4$ the stack turn into $[5, \\textbf{4}]$;  after pushing $s_7 = 4$ the stack turn into $[\\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_8 = 5$ the stack is empty. \n\nYou are given an array $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$. You have to calculate the number of its subarrays which are stack exterminable.\n\nNote, that you have to answer $q$ independent queries.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of queries.\n\nThe first line of each query contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$)\u00a0\u2014 the length of array $a$.\n\nThe second line of each query contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$)\u00a0\u2014 the elements.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ over all queries does not exceed $3 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print one integer in single line \u2014 the number of stack exterminable subarrays of the array $a$.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n3\n5\n2 1 1 2 2\n6\n1 2 1 1 3 2\n9\n3 1 2 2 1 6 6 3 3\n\nOutput\n4\n1\n8\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first query there are four stack exterminable subarrays: $a_{1 \\ldots 4} = [2, 1, 1, 2], a_{2 \\ldots 3} = [1, 1], a_{2 \\ldots 5} = [1, 1, 2, 2], a_{4 \\ldots 5} = [2, 2]$.\n\nIn the second query, only one subarray is exterminable subarray\u00a0\u2014 $a_{3 \\ldots 4}$.\n\nIn the third query, there are eight stack exterminable subarrays: $a_{1 \\ldots 8}, a_{2 \\ldots 5}, a_{2 \\ldots 7}, a_{2 \\ldots 9}, a_{3 \\ldots 4}, a_{6 \\ldots 7}, a_{6 \\ldots 9}, a_{8 \\ldots 9}$.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of \"abc\" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate strings and utilize loops for repeated operations. The solution successfully handled multiple test cases by reading input, processing each string, and outputting the final result after all removals.\n\n    The implemented code used a while loop to check for \"abc\" and the `replace` method to remove it. This method was efficient for the problem's constraints, as it ensured that the string was modified in place until no \"abc\" substrings were left. The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def remove_abc_pairs(test_cases):\n        for s in test_cases:\n            while \"abc\" in s:\n                s = s.replace(\"abc\", \"\", 1)\n            print(s)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]\n    remove_abc_pairs(test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding string operations and iterative processes in programming.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved counting the number of continuous subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers in a given array of integers. The solution utilized a two-pointer technique (or sliding window approach) to efficiently calculate the number of subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers and then derived the count of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers by subtracting the counts for `k` and `k-1`.\n\n    Key concepts tested included:\n    - Understanding of subarrays and their properties.\n    - Efficient counting techniques using sliding windows to avoid nested loops, which would be inefficient for larger arrays.\n\n    The implemented solution was effective, and the helper function `count_at_most_k_odds` successfully counted the valid subarrays. The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:\n        \n            def count_at_most_k_odds(nums, k):\n                left = 0\n                count = 0\n                odd_count = 0\n                for right in range(len(nums)):\n                    if nums[right] % 2 == 1:  # Check if the number is odd\n                        odd_count += 1\n                    while odd_count > k:  # If we have more than k odd numbers\n                        if nums[left] % 2 == 1:  # Check if the number at left is odd\n                            odd_count -= 1\n                        left += 1\n                    count += (right - left + 1)  # Count the number of valid subarrays\n                return count\n        \n            return count_at_most_k_odds(nums, k) - count_at_most_k_odds(nums, k - 1)\n    ```\n\n    This approach proved to be efficient and effective, passing all test cases without errors. The experience reinforced the importance of using optimal algorithms for counting problems in arrays.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.\n        number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.\n        The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.\n\n\n        -----Input:-----\n        - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.\n        - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.\n        - Next Q line contains two number I and K.\n\n        -----Output:-----\n        For each test case print required answer.\n\n        -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----\n        - 1<=T<=5\n        - 1<=N, K<=4000\n        - 1<=Q<=1000000\n        Subtask 3: 5 points\n        - 1<=T<=5\n        - 1<=N, K<=16\n        - 1<=Q<=1000\n        Subtask 1: 25 points\n        - T=1\n        - 1<=N, K<=4000\n        - 1<=Q<=100000\n        Subtask 2: 70 points\n        - Original Constraints.\n\n        -----Example:-----\n        Input:\n\n        1\n\n        3 3\n\n        1 2\n\n        2 1\n\n        3 2\n\n        Output:\n\n        0\n\n        2\n\n        2\n\n        -----Explanation:-----\n        For N=3\n\n        total subsets are:\n\n        {1}\n\n        {2}\n\n        {3}\n\n        {1,2}\n\n        {1,3}\n\n        {2,3}\n\n        {1,2,3}\n\n        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.\n\n        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.\n\n        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        None\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:\n           The task is to determine how many subsets can be formed from the numbers 1 to N such that a specific number I appears in the K-th position of the subset when sorted.

        "content": "In this task, the goal was to determine the number of exterminable subarrays from given arrays based on specific stack operations. The core concept involved simulating stack behavior where elements are pushed or popped based on their equality with the top of the stack. \n\nThe initial approach used a brute-force method to check all possible subarrays by iterating through each starting and ending index, applying a helper function to determine if the subarray could be exterminated. While this method worked for the provided test cases, it was inefficient for larger inputs due to its O(n^3) complexity, which could lead to performance issues given the constraints.\n\nThe key takeaway was the importance of optimizing the solution to handle larger datasets efficiently. Future attempts could focus on using a more efficient algorithm, possibly leveraging a two-pointer technique or dynamic programming to reduce the time complexity. \n\nThe final code successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the brute-force method was sufficient for the given input limits, but it highlighted the need for optimization in more extensive scenarios. The code structure included a main function for input/output handling, a function to check exterminability, and a counting function for exterminable subarrays. \n\nHere\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n```python\ndef is_exterminable(subarray):\n    stack = []\n    for element in subarray:\n        if not stack or stack[-1] != element:\n            stack.append(element)\n        else:\n            stack.pop()\n    return len(stack) == 0\n\ndef count_exterminable_subarrays(array):\n    count = 0\n    n = len(array)\n    for start in range(n):\n        for end in range(start, n):\n            if is_exterminable(array[start:end + 1]):\n                count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    q = int(input())\n    for _ in range(q):\n        n = int(input())\n        array = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        result = count_exterminable_subarrays(array)\n        print(result)\n\nmain()\n``` \n\nThis summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies employed, and the need for potential optimization in future iterations."

        "content": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach using a trie-like structure to manage the stack operations and count exterminable subarrays. Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Trie Structure**: The solution uses a trie to represent the stack states. Each node in the trie corresponds to a unique state of the stack, allowing for efficient tracking of how many times each state has been reached.\n\n2. **Stack Management**: Instead of simulating the stack operations for every possible subarray, the solution maintains a single stack and a corresponding node stack that tracks the current state in the trie. This reduces the need for nested loops over subarrays.\n\n3. **Counting Exterminable Subarrays**: The solution calculates the number of exterminable subarrays by maintaining a counter that adjusts based on the current state of the stack. It uses combinatorial counting to determine how many valid subarrays can be formed from the current state.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: This approach significantly reduces the time complexity compared to the naive method of checking each subarray individually. By leveraging the trie structure, the solution can efficiently count exterminable subarrays in a single pass through the array.\n\nOverall, the official solution is a great example of how to optimize a problem that initially seems to require brute force. It highlights the importance of data structures in managing state and counting efficiently. This experience reinforces the value of exploring alternative approaches to problems, especially those involving combinatorial counting and state management."

        "content": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads an integer input representing the number of test cases and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads an integer that indicates the size of an array, followed by the array elements themselves. It then calculates the number of exterminable subarrays within the given array. Finally, it prints the result for each test case. The function effectively handles multiple queries and outputs the corresponding results. Overall, it serves as the entry point for processing exterminable subarrays based on user input.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to analyze sequences or arrays for specific properties related to stack operations. For example, in competitive programming, understanding how to determine stack exterminable subarrays can help solve problems involving data structures efficiently. It can also be applied in algorithm design, where recognizing patterns in data manipulation can lead to optimized solutions. Additionally, this knowledge is beneficial in educational contexts, such as teaching data structures and algorithms, where practical examples can illustrate theoretical concepts."
