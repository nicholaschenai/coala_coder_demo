We will do this for multiple test cases.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - For each test case, we will find the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to N. This can be done by taking the integer division of N by 10 and then multiplying by 10.\n   - Once we have the largest multiple of 10, we can calculate the sum of all multiples of 10 up to that number. The multiples of 10 form an arithmetic series where the first term is 10, the last term is the largest multiple of 10, and the common difference is also 10.\n   - The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (\\text{first term} + \\text{last term})\n     \\]\n     where \\( n \\) is the number of terms.

Initially, I attempted to derive a formula for the series but mistakenly used an incorrect formula that did not correspond to the series, leading to incorrect outputs.\n\n    Upon analyzing the series, I identified that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, which led to the realization that the N'th term could be computed as the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares. The correct formula for the N'th term is:\n    - T(N) = (N-1) * N * (2(N-1) + 1) / 6\n\n    This formula was derived from the known formula for the sum of squares. After implementing this corrected formula, the code produced the expected results for all test cases.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(N):\n        if N == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1) // 6\n\n    def main():\n        T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N\n            result = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            print(result)  # Output the result\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring that the derived formulas are correct before implementation.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to calculate the mean of maximum scores for students after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve, which are assigned to specific ranges of students based on their roll numbers.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the efficient updating of scores for a range of students based on multiple queries. The approach involved initializing a list of scores, iterating through each question, and updating the scores for the specified range. The final mean score was calculated by summing the scores and dividing by the number of students, using integer division to obtain the floor value.\n\n    The solution was implemented successfully without any errors, and the provided code snippet effectively handled the input and output requirements. The key takeaway was the importance of managing score updates efficiently, especially given the constraints where both the number of students and questions could be large (up to 100,000). The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_mean_scores(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, M = map(int, input().split())\n            scores = [10] * N\n            for _ in range(M):\n                i, j, k = map(int, input().split())\n                for student in range(i - 1, j):\n                    scores[student] *= k\n            total_score = sum(scores)\n            mean_score = total_score // N\n            print(mean_score)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    calculate_mean_scores(T)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements and efficiently managing data updates in programming challenges.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        The chef is trying to solve some series problems, Chef wants your help to code it.
