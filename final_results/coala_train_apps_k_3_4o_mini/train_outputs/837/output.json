    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to calculate the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number \"N\" for multiple test cases. \n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the sum of multiples of 10 up to a number N, we can determine the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to N. This can be found by taking the integer division of N by 10 and then multiplying by 10. The multiples of 10 up to this number form an arithmetic series where the first term is 10 and the last term is the largest multiple of 10. The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = \\frac{\\text{number of terms}}{2} \\times (\\text{first term} + \\text{last term})\n   \\]\n   The number of terms can be found by dividing the largest multiple of 10 by 10.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):\n       largest_multiple = (N // 10) * 10\n       number_of_terms = largest_multiple // 10\n       sum = (number_of_terms * (10 + largest_multiple)) // 2\n       return sum\n\n   function main():\n       read T\n       for each test case from 1 to T:\n           read N\n           result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)\n           print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):\n    # Find the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N\n    largest_multiple = (N // 10) * 10\n    # Calculate the number of terms in the series of multiples of 10\n    number_of_terms = largest_multiple // 10\n    # Calculate the sum of the arithmetic series\n    sum = (number_of_terms * (10 + largest_multiple)) // 2\n    return sum\n\ndef main():\n    T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N\n        result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)  # Calculate the sum of multiples of 10\n        print(result)  # Output the result\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n```",
