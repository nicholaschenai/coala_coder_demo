This is essential for checking how many times the difference `(numSum - k)` has been seen, which directly correlates to the number of valid subarrays ending at the current index.\n\n3. **Initialization**: The dictionary is initialized with `dic[0] = 1`, which accounts for the case where a subarray starting from the beginning of the array sums to `k`.\n\n4. **Incrementing Counts**: The solution effectively increments the count of the current cumulative sum in the dictionary, ensuring that all previous occurrences are accounted for in future iterations.\n\n### Comparison with My Approach:\n- My approach was fundamentally sound and aligned with the official solution.

        "content": "\n[description]\nThis function calculates the number of contiguous subarrays within a given list of integers that sum up to a specified integer k. It utilizes a hashmap to keep track of cumulative sums and their frequencies as it iterates through the list. For each element, it updates the cumulative sum and checks if the difference between the current cumulative sum and k exists in the hashmap. If it does, it increments the count of valid subarrays by the frequency of that difference. The hashmap is then updated with the current cumulative sum, either by incrementing its count or initializing it. Finally, the function returns the total count of subarrays that meet the criteria.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to analyze subarrays within a larger dataset, particularly in problems involving cumulative sums and target values. It can be applied in various fields such as data analysis, algorithm design, and competitive programming. Understanding how to efficiently count subarrays with a specific sum can help in optimizing solutions for problems related to financial data, statistical analysis, or any situation where continuous segments of data need to be evaluated against a target sum."
