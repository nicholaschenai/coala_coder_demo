Initially, I attempted to derive a formula for the series but mistakenly used an incorrect formula that did not correspond to the series, leading to incorrect outputs.\n\n    Upon analyzing the series, I identified that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, which led to the realization that the N'th term could be computed as the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares. The correct formula for the N'th term is:\n    - T(N) = (N-1) * N * (2(N-1) + 1) / 6\n\n    This formula was derived from the known formula for the sum of squares. After implementing this corrected formula, the code produced the expected results for all test cases.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(N):\n        if N == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1) // 6\n\n    def main():\n        T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N\n            result = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            print(result)  # Output the result\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring that the derived formulas are correct before implementation.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The task was to calculate the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to a given number \"N\" for multiple test cases. The solution involved identifying the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N, calculating the number of terms in the series of multiples of 10, and then using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to compute the result efficiently.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to work with arithmetic series and integer division to find multiples. The approach was straightforward: determine the largest multiple of 10, count how many multiples exist up to that point, and apply the sum formula. This method is efficient and avoids any potential issues with large numbers, as Python handles large integers natively.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, and the code was structured to read input, process each test case, and output results correctly. The key takeaway is the importance of understanding arithmetic series and how to leverage mathematical formulas for efficient computation, especially when dealing with potentially large inputs. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):\n        largest_multiple = (N // 10) * 10\n        number_of_terms = largest_multiple // 10\n        sum = (number_of_terms * (10 + largest_multiple)) // 2\n        return sum\n\n    def main():\n        T = int(input())\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)\n            print(result)\n\n    main()\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the value of mathematical insights in programming challenges, particularly in optimizing solutions for large input sizes.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to calculate the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. The challenge was to compute the result efficiently, especially since `N` could be as large as \\(10^{18}\\). The key insight was recognizing that the factorial of `N` would grow rapidly, and thus, calculating it directly was impractical. Instead, I utilized modular arithmetic to keep the calculations manageable.\n\n    The solution involved defining two main functions: one for calculating the factorial modulo \\(10^6 + 3\\) and another for computing the number of particles based on the factorial and the initial count `X`. A critical optimization was to return `0` if `N` was greater than or equal to \\(10^6 + 3\\), as the factorial would be `0` in that case.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was sound, as evidenced by passing the provided test cases. The code structure was clear, with helper functions defined before the main logic, adhering to best practices in programming. \n\n    Key code snippets:\n    ```python\n    def factorial_mod(n, mod):\n        result = 1\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            result = (result * i) % mod\n        return result\n\n    def calculate_particles(N, X):\n        mod = 1000003\n        if N >= mod:\n            return 0\n        factorial_value = factorial_mod(N, mod)\n        return (factorial_value * X) % mod\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of modular arithmetic in handling large numbers and the need for efficient algorithms in competitive programming contexts.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This allows for quick access to the values during query processing. The Golomb numbers are stored in a list `dp`, which is built using the recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Prefix Sums**: The solution maintains a `prefix_storer` list that keeps cumulative sums of the squares of the Golomb numbers.

This is crucial for efficiently calculating the surplus when querying.\n\n4. **Query Handling**: The `fire_query` function computes the result for each query by utilizing the precomputed values and the binary search results. This ensures that each query can be answered in logarithmic time relative to the number of precomputed values.\n\n5. **Efficiency**: The overall complexity of the solution is significantly reduced due to the precomputation and the use of prefix sums, making it feasible to handle up to \\(10^5\\) queries efficiently.\n\nIn contrast, my initial approach attempted to compute the Golomb numbers on-the-fly for each query, which would be inefficient given the constraints, especially for large values of \\(L\\) and \\(R\\). The official solution's use of precomputation and efficient querying techniques is a valuable lesson in optimizing performance for problems involving sequences and range queries."
