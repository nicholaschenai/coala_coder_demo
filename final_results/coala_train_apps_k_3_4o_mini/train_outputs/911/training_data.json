    "summary": "The problem involved calculating the sum of squares of terms in the Golomb sequence for given ranges across multiple test cases. The Golomb sequence is defined recursively, which posed a challenge due to the potential size of the indices (up to \\(10^{10}\\)). \n\nThe key strategy was to use memoization to store previously computed values of the Golomb sequence to avoid redundant calculations. This approach allowed for efficient retrieval of values during the summation process. The recurrence relation \\(G_{n+1} = 1 + G_{n + 1 - G_{G_n}}\\) was utilized to compute the sequence values on-the-fly.\n\nThe final implementation involved a main function to handle input and output, a `sum_of_squares` function to compute the required sums, and a `golomb` function to calculate individual Golomb numbers with memoization. The solution successfully handled the constraints and passed the provided test cases.\n\nHere\u2019s the core code snippet for reference:\n\n```python\ndef golomb(n, memo):\n    if n in memo:\n        return memo[n]\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    memo[n] = 1 + golomb(n - golomb(golomb(n - 1, memo), memo), memo)\n    return memo[n]\n\ndef sum_of_squares(L, R):\n    memo = {}\n    total_sum = 0\n    mod = 10**9 + 7\n    for i in range(L, R + 1):\n        g_i = golomb(i, memo)\n        total_sum = (total_sum + g_i * g_i) % mod\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of memoization in recursive problems, especially when dealing with large input sizes.",
    "reflection": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach to compute the sum of squares of the Golomb sequence over a range, leveraging precomputation and binary search techniques. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Precomputation**: The solution precomputes the Golomb sequence values up to a certain limit (in this case, \\(10^6 + 100\\)). This allows for quick access to the values during query processing. The Golomb numbers are stored in a list `dp`, which is built using the recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Prefix Sums**: The solution maintains a `prefix_storer` list that keeps cumulative sums of the squares of the Golomb numbers. This allows for efficient range sum queries, as the sum of squares from \\(L\\) to \\(R\\) can be computed in constant time using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{sum}(L, R) = \\text{prefix\\_storer}[R] - \\text{prefix\\_storer}[L-1]\n   \\]\n\n3. **Binary Search for Upper Bound**: The function `find_upper_bound` is used to find the index in the `bin_storer` list that corresponds to the largest precomputed Golomb number less than or equal to \\(L\\). This is crucial for efficiently calculating the surplus when querying.\n\n4. **Query Handling**: The `fire_query` function computes the result for each query by utilizing the precomputed values and the binary search results. This ensures that each query can be answered in logarithmic time relative to the number of precomputed values.\n\n5. **Efficiency**: The overall complexity of the solution is significantly reduced due to the precomputation and the use of prefix sums, making it feasible to handle up to \\(10^5\\) queries efficiently.\n\nIn contrast, my initial approach attempted to compute the Golomb numbers on-the-fly for each query, which would be inefficient given the constraints, especially for large values of \\(L\\) and \\(R\\). The official solution's use of precomputation and efficient querying techniques is a valuable lesson in optimizing performance for problems involving sequences and range queries.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThis function reads the number of test cases and processes each case by reading two integers, L and R. For each pair, it calculates the sum of the squares of the Golomb numbers from L to R. The results are then printed for each test case. It utilizes a helper function to compute the Golomb numbers efficiently using memoization. The function ensures that the calculations are performed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to handle large numbers. Overall, it provides a structured way to compute and display the required sums for multiple test cases.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge about the Golomb sequence and its properties is useful in various scenarios, particularly in competitive programming and algorithm design. Understanding the Golomb sequence can help in solving problems related to combinatorial structures, self-describing sequences, and dynamic programming. It can also be beneficial in mathematical research where sequences and their properties are analyzed. Additionally, the efficient computation of sums over large ranges, as demonstrated in the solution, is a common requirement in algorithmic challenges, especially when dealing with constraints that involve large numbers, such as those found in competitive programming contests."
