    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**:\n   The problem involves determining the difficulty of several programming problems based on their subtasks. Each problem has a set of subtasks, each with a score and the number of contestants who solved it. The difficulty of a problem is defined by counting how many times the number of contestants who solved a subtask decreases as we look at subtasks sorted by their scores. We need to sort the problems based on their difficulty and output the indices of the problems in increasing order of difficulty.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**:\n   - Read the number of problems (P) and the number of subtasks (S).\n   - For each problem, read the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.\n   - Pair the scores with the number of contestants and sort them based on scores.\n   - Count the number of valid indices where the number of contestants decreases from one subtask to the next.\n   - Store the difficulty as a tuple (count, problem index) for each problem.\n   - Sort these tuples first by count and then by problem index.\n   - Output the sorted indices of the problems.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function calculate_difficulty(P, S):\n       difficulties = []\n       for i from 1 to P:\n           read scores\n           read number of contestants\n           pair scores with contestants\n           sort pairs by scores\n           count = 0\n           for k from 1 to S-1:\n               if contestants[k-1] > contestants[k]:\n                   count += 1\n           difficulties.append((count, i))\n       sort difficulties by count and then by index\n       for each difficulty in difficulties:\n           print index\n\n   read P and S\n   calculate_difficulty(P, S)\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef calculate_difficulty(P, S):\n    difficulties = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, P + 1):\n        scores = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        contestants = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n        # Pair scores with contestants and sort by scores\n        paired = sorted(zip(scores, contestants))\n        \n        count = 0\n        # Count valid indices where NS_k > NS_{k + 1}\n        for k in range(1, S):\n            if paired[k - 1][1] > paired[k][1]:\n                count += 1\n        \n        difficulties.append((count, i))\n    \n    # Sort difficulties by count and then by index\n    difficulties.sort()\n    \n    for difficulty in difficulties:\n        print(difficulty[1])\n\n# Read P and S\nP, S = map(int, input().split())\ncalculate_difficulty(P, S)\n```",
