Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).\nThe difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:\n- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.\n- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.\n- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.\n- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.\nYou should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels.

We need to determine the difficulty of each problem based on how many times the number of contestants who solved a subtask is greater than the next subtask when the subtasks are sorted by score. The difficulty of a problem is represented as a pair of values: the count of such instances and the problem's index.

The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the available days to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging simple loops and arithmetic.\n\n    The final implementation was clean and efficient, successfully passing all provided test cases. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all edge cases (like having fewer problems than needed for a single contest) are considered. The solution was implemented without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints given. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_contests(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    max_contests(T)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of clear problem understanding and systematic solution development.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution effectively simplifies the problem by directly calculating the total number of problems and determining how many contests can be formed in a straightforward manner. The key steps are:\n\n    1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it captures the number of setters (N), the number of problems required for a contest (K), and the number of days available (D).\n    2. **Problem Summation**: It computes the total number of problems created by summing the list of problems from each setter.\n    3. **Contest Calculation**: It calculates the maximum number of contests that can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required for each contest.\n    4. **Final Output**: It prints the minimum of the contests possible and the days available, ensuring that the output respects the constraints of the problem.\n\n    The official solution is concise and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for input and summation, which keeps the code clean and readable. \n\n    One insight from this experience is the importance of directly addressing the problem constraints in a clear manner. The official solution does this effectively by using a single line to compute the number of contests and another to print the result, which is both efficient and easy to understand. \n\n    Overall, the approach I took was similar, but the official solution's brevity and clarity highlight the effectiveness of straightforward calculations in competitive programming.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In solving the problem of finding a permutation \\( P \\) such that \\( f(P) = K \\), I learned several key concepts and strategies. The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximums of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a descending permutation is \\( N \\times (N - 1) \\). This insight was crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a given \\( K \\).\n\n    Initially, my approach to calculating the maximum value and adjusting the permutation was flawed. I incorrectly calculated the maximum possible value and did not implement a clear strategy for adjusting the permutation to reach \\( K \\). The adjustment logic involved swapping adjacent elements, but it lacked a systematic approach to ensure that the desired \\( K \\) could be achieved.\n\n    After revising the code, I implemented a more structured approach: I calculated the maximum value correctly, checked if \\( K \\) was feasible, and then constructed a descending permutation. I iteratively adjusted the permutation by swapping elements while recalculating \\( f(P) \\) until it matched \\( K \\) or determined it was impossible.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, input().split())\n            max_value = N * (N - 1)\n        \n            if K > max_value:\n                print(-1)\n                continue\n        \n            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n            current_f = sum(max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1]) for i in range(N - 1))\n        \n            for i in range(N - 1):\n                if current_f > K:\n                    if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:\n                        permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                        current_f = sum(max(permutation[j], permutation[j + 1]) for j in range(N - 1))\n            \n                if current_f == K:\n                    break\n        \n            if current_f == K:\n                print(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n            else:\n                print(-1)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    find_permutation(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of clearly understanding the problem constraints and systematically approaching adjustments in permutations.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
