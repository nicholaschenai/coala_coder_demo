## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mandarin chinese
, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

-----Output-----
Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le P \le 100,000$
- $2 \le S \le 30$
- $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
- in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$
Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a contest with multiple problems, each having several subtasks. Each subtask has a score and a number of contestants who solved it. We need to determine the difficulty of each problem based on how many times the number of contestants who solved a subtask is greater than the next subtask when the subtasks are sorted by score. The difficulty of a problem is represented as a pair of values: the count of such instances and the problem's index. Finally, we need to sort the problems based on their difficulty and output the indices of the problems in increasing order of difficulty.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Read the number of problems (P) and subtasks (S).
   - For each problem, read the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.
   - Pair the scores with the number of contestants and sort them based on scores.
   - Count how many times the number of contestants who solved a subtask is greater than the next subtask in the sorted list.
   - Store the count and the problem index as a tuple.
   - Sort all problems based on the count first and then by index.
   - Output the sorted indices.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Read P and S
   Initialize an empty list for difficulties
   For each problem from 1 to P:
       Read scores and number of contestants
       Pair scores with contestants and sort by scores

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mandarin chinese
, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

-----Output-----
Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le P \le 100,000$
- $2 \le S \le 30$
- $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the problems created by his setters, the number of problems needed for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the available days to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging simple loops and arithmetic.

    The final implementation was clean and efficient, successfully passing all provided test cases. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all edge cases (like having fewer problems than needed for a single contest) are considered. The solution was implemented without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints given. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def max_contests(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    max_contests(T)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of clear problem understanding and systematic solution development.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively simplifies the problem by directly calculating the total number of problems and determining how many contests can be formed in a straightforward manner. The key steps are:

    1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it captures the number of setters (N), the number of problems required for a contest (K), and the number of days available (D).
    2. **Problem Summation**: It computes the total number of problems created by summing the list of problems from each setter.
    3. **Contest Calculation**: It calculates the maximum number of contests that can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required for each contest.
    4. **Final Output**: It prints the minimum of the contests possible and the days available, ensuring that the output respects the constraints of the problem.

    The official solution is concise and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for input and summation, which keeps the code clean and readable. 

    One insight from this experience is the importance of directly addressing the problem constraints in a clear manner. The official solution does this effectively by using a single line to compute the number of contests and another to print the result, which is both efficient and easy to understand. 

    Overall, the approach I took was similar, but the official solution's brevity and clarity highlight the effectiveness of straightforward calculations in competitive programming.

[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of finding a permutation \( P \) such that \( f(P) = K \), I learned several key concepts and strategies. The function \( f(P) \) is defined as the sum of the maximums of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \( f(P) \) for a descending permutation is \( N \times (N - 1) \). This insight was crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a given \( K \).

    Initially, my approach to calculating the maximum value and adjusting the permutation was flawed. I incorrectly calculated the maximum possible value and did not implement a clear strategy for adjusting the permutation to reach \( K \). The adjustment logic involved swapping adjacent elements, but it lacked a systematic approach to ensure that the desired \( K \) could be achieved.

    After revising the code, I implemented a more structured approach: I calculated the maximum value correctly, checked if \( K \) was feasible, and then constructed a descending permutation. I iteratively adjusted the permutation by swapping elements while recalculating \( f(P) \) until it matched \( K \) or determined it was impossible.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def find_permutation(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, input().split())
            max_value = N * (N - 1)
        
            if K > max_value:
                print(-1)
                continue
        
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_f = sum(max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1]) for i in range(N - 1))
        
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_f > K:
                    if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:
                        permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                        current_f = sum(max(permutation[j], permutation[j + 1]) for j in range(N - 1))
            
                if current_f == K:
                    break
        
            if current_f == K:
                print(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
            else:
                print(-1)

    T = int(input())
    find_permutation(T)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of clearly understanding the problem constraints and systematically approaching adjustments in permutations.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**:
   The problem involves determining the difficulty of several programming problems based on their subtasks. Each problem has a set of subtasks, each with a score and the number of contestants who solved it. The difficulty of a problem is defined by counting how many times the number of contestants who solved a subtask decreases as we look at subtasks sorted by their scores. We need to sort the problems based on their difficulty and output the indices of the problems in increasing order of difficulty.

2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**:
   - Read the number of problems (P) and the number of subtasks (S).
   - For each problem, read the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.
   - Pair the scores with the number of contestants and sort them based on scores.
   - Count the number of valid indices where the number of contestants decreases from one subtask to the next.
   - Store the difficulty as a tuple (count, problem index) for each problem.
   - Sort these tuples first by count and then by problem index.
   - Output the sorted indices of the problems.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function calculate_difficulty(P, S):
       difficulties = []
       for i from 1 to P:
           read scores
           read number of contestants
           pair scores with contestants
           sort pairs by scores
           count = 0
           for k from 1 to S-1:
               if contestants[k-1] > contestants[k]:
                   count += 1
           difficulties.append((count, i))
       sort difficulties by count and then by index
       for each difficulty in difficulties:
           print index

   read P and S
   calculate_difficulty(P, S)
   ```

Each problem has a set of subtasks, each with a score and the number of contestants who solved it. The difficulty of a problem is defined by counting how many times the number of contestants who solved a subtask decreases as we look at subtasks sorted by their scores. We need to sort the problems based on their difficulty and output the indices of the problems in increasing order of difficulty.

2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**:
   - Read the number of problems (P) and the number of subtasks (S).
   - For each problem, read the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.
   - Pair the scores with the number of contestants and sort them based on scores.
   - Count the number of valid indices where the number of contestants decreases from one subtask to the next.
   - Store the difficulty as a tuple (count, problem index) for each problem.
   - Sort these tuples first by count and then by problem index.
   - Output the sorted indices of the problems.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function calculate_difficulty(P, S):
       difficulties = []
       for i from 1 to P:
           read scores
           read number of contestants
           pair scores with contestants
           sort pairs by scores
           count = 0
           for k from 1 to S-1:
               if contestants[k-1] > contestants[k]:
                   count += 1
           difficulties.append((count, i))
       sort difficulties by count and then by index
       for each difficulty in difficulties:
           print index

   read P and S
   calculate_difficulty(P, S)
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mandarin chinese
, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

-----Output-----
Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le P \le 100,000$
- $2 \le S \le 30$
- $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
- in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$
Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] In this task, I was required to determine the difficulty of programming problems based on their subtasks, which involved calculating how many times the number of contestants solving a subtask decreases as we sort the subtasks by their scores. The solution involved reading input data, processing it to count the valid indices, and then sorting the problems based on their calculated difficulty.

The core concepts tested in this problem included sorting, tuple manipulation, and counting conditions based on comparisons. The approach I took was to pair scores with the number of contestants, sort these pairs, and then count the valid indices where the number of contestants decreased. This method was efficient given the constraints, particularly since the number of subtasks (S) is relatively small (up to 30), allowing for straightforward comparisons.

The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was sound, as evidenced by passing the provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution was straightforward without any significant complications. The key takeaway is the importance of careful data structuring and sorting when dealing with problems that require comparative analysis.

Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem by utilizing a dictionary to group problems based on their calculated difficulty scores. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:

1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of problems (`p`) and subtasks (`s`) in a single line, which is efficient and straightforward.

2. **Using a Dictionary for Grouping**: Instead of maintaining a list of tuples for difficulties, the official solution uses a dictionary (`scores`) where the keys are the difficulty scores and the values are lists of problem indices. This allows for efficient grouping and retrieval of problems with the same difficulty.

3. **Score Calculation**: The solution pairs scores with the number of contestants who solved them using a dictionary (`nsc`). It then sorts the scores and counts the number of valid indices where the number of contestants decreases. This is done using a simple loop that compares adjacent scores.

4. **Sorting and Output**: After calculating the scores, the solution sorts the keys of the dictionary and then constructs a final list of problem indices in the correct order. This two-step sorting (first by score, then by problem index) ensures that the output meets the problem's requirements.

5. **Efficiency**: The use of dictionaries and sorting operations is efficient given the constraints, and the overall complexity remains manageable even for the upper limits of the input sizes.

Overall, the official solution is insightful in its use of data structures to simplify the problem and ensure clarity in the logic. The approach of grouping by difficulty and then sorting is particularly effective for this type of problem.

The main function is `calculate_difficulty`.
INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] This function calculates the difficulty of a series of problems based on contestant scores and their rankings. It reads the number of problems and scores, then for each problem, it pairs the scores with contestant identifiers and sorts them. It counts the number of instances where a contestant's score is greater than the next contestant's score, indicating a drop in ranking. The results are stored as tuples of the count and problem index. After processing all problems, the difficulties are sorted and the indices of the problems are printed in order of their calculated difficulty. The function ultimately provides a ranking of problems based on their difficulty levels.

You are a helpful assistant that extracts important information from problems and solutions to aid in searchability and education.

## Instructions
- Read through the problem and solution carefully.
- Reason out, step by step, in what scenarios this knowledge would be useful.
- Focus on general patterns and situations to help connect this knowledge to new situations.
- Then, include a list of keywords that are useful for searching this problem/solution pair.

## Response format
Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"scenarios": {"description": "In what scenarios will this knowledge be useful? Answer in a paragraph.", "title": "Scenarios", "type": "string"}, "keywords": {"description": "List of keywords that are useful for searching this problem/solution pair", "items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Keywords", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["scenarios", "keywords"]}

[Problem]
    Mandarin chinese
    , Russian and Vietnamese as well.
    Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
    The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
    - Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
    - Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
    - Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
    - For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
    You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
    - $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

    -----Output-----
    Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le P \le 100,000$
    - $2 \le S \le 30$
    - $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
    - $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
    - in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$
    Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

    -----Example Input-----
    3 3
    16 24 60
