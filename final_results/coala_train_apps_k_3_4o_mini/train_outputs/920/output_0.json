    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   We have a number of students represented as a string of 'b' (boys) and 'g' (girls). The goal is to rearrange these students in such a way that the total awkwardness, defined as the sum of distances between each boy and girl, is minimized. The distance between two students is the absolute difference of their positions in the line.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To minimize the awkwardness, we can group all boys together and all girls together. This way, the distance between boys and girls is minimized because they will be adjacent to each other. The awkwardness can be calculated by counting the number of boys and girls and using their positions to compute the total distance.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - For each test case:\n     - Count the number of boys (`count_b`) and girls (`count_g`).\n     - Calculate the awkwardness using the formula:\n       - The awkwardness can be calculated as `count_b * count_g * (count_b + count_g - 1) / 2`.\n     - Print the result.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s):\n    # Count the number of boys and girls\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_g = s.count('g')\n    \n    # Calculate the minimum awkwardness\n    # The formula is count_b * count_g * (count_b + count_g - 1) / 2\n    awkwardness = count_b * count_g * (count_b + count_g - 1) // 2\n    \n    return awkwardness\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    s = input().strip()  # Read each test case string\n    result = calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s)  # Calculate the minimum awkwardness\n    print(result)  # Print the result for each test case\n``` \n\nThis code efficiently calculates the minimum awkwardness for each test case by counting the boys and girls and applying the derived formula.",
