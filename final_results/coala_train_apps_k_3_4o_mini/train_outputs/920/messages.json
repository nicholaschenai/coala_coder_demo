Today, during the morning prayer, all the students are standing in a line. You are given a string $s$ with length $N$; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of this string is 'b' if the $i$-th student in the line is a boy or 'g' if this student is a girl.\nThe awkwardness of this configuration of students is defined as the sum of pairwise distances between each boy and girl. The distance between the $i$-th and $j$-th student in the line is $|i - j|$. Formally, the awkwardness is \u2211i=1N\u2211j=i+1sj\u2260siN(j\u2212i).\u2211i=1N\u2211j=i+1sj\u2260siN(j\u2212i).\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^N \\, \\sum\\limits_{j=i+1\\\\ s_j \\neq s_i}^N (j - i)\\,.\nAs the teacher, it is your responsibility to reorder the students in such a way that the awkwardness of the resulting configuration is the smallest possible. You may reorder the students in the line in any way you want. Find the minimum awkwardness that can be achieved.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $s$.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the minimum possible awkwardness.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 10^5$\n- $1 \\le |s| \\le 10^5$\n- each character of $s$ is either 'b' or 'g'\n- the sum of $|s|$ over all test cases does not exceed $4 \\cdot 10^6$\n\n-----Example Input-----\n3\ngb\nbgg\nbbgg\n\n-----Example Output-----\n1\n2\n6\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1: The total awkwardness is $|1 - 0| = 1$, no matter how you arrange the students.\nExample case 2: Initially, the awkwardness is $|1 - 0| + |2 - 0| = 1 + 2 = 3$. However, you can move the boy between the two girls, i.e. choose the configuration \"gbg\". Here, the awkwardness is $|1 - 0| + |2 - 1| = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

We want to rearrange these students in such a way that the total awkwardness, defined as the sum of distances between each boy and girl, is minimized. The distance between two students is the absolute difference of their positions in the line.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To minimize the awkwardness, we can group all boys together and all girls together. This way, the distance between boys and girls is minimized because they will be adjacent to each other.

The solution involved reading input data, processing it to count the valid indices, and then sorting the problems based on their calculated difficulty.\n\n    The core concepts tested in this problem included sorting, tuple manipulation, and counting conditions based on comparisons. The approach I took was to pair scores with the number of contestants, sort these pairs, and then count the valid indices where the number of contestants decreased. This method was efficient given the constraints, particularly since the number of subtasks (S) is relatively small (up to 30), allowing for straightforward comparisons.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was sound, as evidenced by passing the provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution was straightforward without any significant complications. The key takeaway is the importance of careful data structuring and sorting when dealing with problems that require comparative analysis. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_difficulty(P, S):\n        difficulties = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, P + 1):\n            scores = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            contestants = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n            paired = sorted(zip(scores, contestants))\n        \n            count = 0\n            for k in range(1, S):\n                if paired[k - 1][1] > paired[k][1]:\n                    count += 1\n        \n            difficulties.append((count, i))\n    \n        difficulties.sort()\n    \n        for difficulty in difficulties:\n            print(difficulty[1])\n\n    P, S = map(int, input().split())\n    calculate_difficulty(P, S)\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by moving one character from any position in a given string to any other position. The solution required iterating through each character, removing it, and inserting it at every possible position in the remaining string to find the smallest possible arrangement.\n\n    Throughout the attempts, the main issues revolved around correctly handling the input and output formats. Initially, the output was printed directly as strings, which did not match the expected format of a list of dictionaries. The expected output was to be structured as `[{smallest_string}]` for each test case, but the implementation was returning a list of strings instead.\n\n    The final solution involved collecting results in a list and ensuring that the output was printed in the correct format. The key takeaway was the importance of adhering to the specified output format, as it can lead to confusion and failed tests if not followed precisely.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet that was intended to solve the problem:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(test_cases):\n        results = []  # To collect results for each test case\n        for s in test_cases:\n            smallest_string = s\n            n = len(s)\n        \n            for i in range(n):\n                char = s[i]\n                new_string = s[:i] + s[i+1:]\n            \n                for j in range(n - 1):\n                    candidate_string = new_string[:j] + char + new_string[j:]\n                    if candidate_string < smallest_string:\n                        smallest_string = candidate_string\n        \n            results.append({smallest_string})  # Collect the smallest string for the test case in a dictionary\n\n        print(results)  # Print the results as a list of dictionaries\n\n    # Read number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]\n    find_lexicographically_smallest_string(test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly, especially regarding input and output formats, to ensure successful implementation.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by utilizing a dictionary to group problems based on their calculated difficulty scores. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:\n\n    1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of problems (`p`) and subtasks (`s`) in a single line, which is efficient and straightforward.\n\n    2. **Using a Dictionary for Grouping**: Instead of maintaining a list of tuples for difficulties, the official solution uses a dictionary (`scores`) where the keys are the difficulty scores and the values are lists of problem indices. This allows for efficient grouping and retrieval of problems with the same difficulty.\n\n    3. **Score Calculation**: The solution pairs scores with the number of contestants who solved them using a dictionary (`nsc`). It then sorts the scores and counts the number of valid indices where the number of contestants decreases. This is done using a simple loop that compares adjacent scores.\n\n    4. **Sorting and Output**: After calculating the scores, the solution sorts the keys of the dictionary and then constructs a final list of problem indices in the correct order. This two-step sorting (first by score, then by problem index) ensures that the output meets the problem's requirements.\n\n    5. **Efficiency**: The use of dictionaries and sorting operations is efficient given the constraints, and the overall complexity remains manageable even for the upper limits of the input sizes.\n\n    Overall, the official solution is insightful in its use of data structures to simplify the problem and ensure clarity in the logic. The approach of grouping by difficulty and then sorting is particularly effective for this type of problem.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The awkwardness should be calculated based on the actual positions of boys and girls rather than a simplified formula.\n\n2. **Identifying the Mistake**:\n   The formula I used, `count_b * count_g * (count_b + count_g - 1) // 2`, does not accurately represent the total distances between boys and girls.

The alternating sum is defined as \\( a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \\ldots \\). The challenge was to maximize this sum based on the original arrangement of strengths without any swap operations.\n\n    Initially, I misunderstood the requirement and attempted to calculate the alternating sum based on the sorted strengths rather than the original order. This led to incorrect outputs, as the alternating sum should reflect the optimal selection of strengths from the original list. The correct approach involved sorting the strengths in descending order and then applying the alternating sum formula based on the sorted list.\n\n    The final solution correctly implemented this logic by sorting the strengths and calculating the maximum alternating sum by adding strengths at even indices and subtracting those at odd indices. However, despite these corrections, the solution still failed to produce the expected results, indicating a deeper misunderstanding of how to select strengths optimally.\n\n    Key Takeaways:\n    - The alternating sum needs to be calculated based on the optimal selection of strengths, not just their positions.\n    - Sorting the strengths in descending order is essential for maximizing the alternating sum.\n    - Careful attention to the problem requirements is crucial to avoid logical errors in implementation.\n\n    Final Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def calculate_max_strength(t):\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n, q = map(int, input().split())\n            strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            strengths.sort(reverse=True)\n            max_strength = 0\n            for index in range(n):\n                if index % 2 == 0:\n                    max_strength += strengths[index]\n                else:\n                    max_strength -= strengths[index]\n            print(max_strength)\n\n    t = int(input())\n    calculate_max_strength(t)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and the need for careful implementation to achieve the desired results.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In solving the problem of determining the maximum number of magnets that can attract pieces of iron, I learned the importance of carefully managing the conditions for attraction, particularly the influence of distance, conducting sheets, and blocked cells. The initial approach failed primarily due to incorrect handling of the attraction power calculation and the management of magnets and irons when blocked cells were encountered.\n\n    Key strategies that worked included:\n    - Iterating through the string to collect indices of magnets and irons, and processing them in segments separated by blocked cells.\n    - Using a set to track which irons had already been attracted, ensuring that each could only be used once.\n\n    The final solution involved a clear structure where the attraction power was calculated based on the distance and the number of conducting sheets between magnets and irons.

The solution involved reading input data, processing it to count the valid indices, and then sorting the problems based on their calculated difficulty.\n\n    The core concepts tested in this problem included sorting, tuple manipulation, and counting conditions based on comparisons. The approach I took was to pair scores with the number of contestants, sort these pairs, and then count the valid indices where the number of contestants decreased. This method was efficient given the constraints, particularly since the number of subtasks (S) is relatively small (up to 30), allowing for straightforward comparisons.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was sound, as evidenced by passing the provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution was straightforward without any significant complications. The key takeaway is the importance of careful data structuring and sorting when dealing with problems that require comparative analysis. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_difficulty(P, S):\n        difficulties = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, P + 1):\n            scores = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            contestants = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n            paired = sorted(zip(scores, contestants))\n        \n            count = 0\n            for k in range(1, S):\n                if paired[k - 1][1] > paired[k][1]:\n                    count += 1\n        \n            difficulties.append((count, i))\n    \n        difficulties.sort()\n    \n        for difficulty in difficulties:\n            print(difficulty[1])\n\n    P, S = map(int, input().split())\n    calculate_difficulty(P, S)\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to calculate the maximum strength of an army formed by Pok\u00e9mon strengths using an alternating sum formula. The alternating sum is defined as \\( a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \\ldots \\). The challenge was to maximize this sum based on the original arrangement of strengths without any swap operations.\n\n    Initially, I misunderstood the requirement and attempted to calculate the alternating sum based on the sorted strengths rather than the original order. This led to incorrect outputs, as the alternating sum should reflect the optimal selection of strengths from the original list. The correct approach involved sorting the strengths in descending order and then applying the alternating sum formula based on the sorted list.\n\n    The final solution correctly implemented this logic by sorting the strengths and calculating the maximum alternating sum by adding strengths at even indices and subtracting those at odd indices. However, despite these corrections, the solution still failed to produce the expected results, indicating a deeper misunderstanding of how to select strengths optimally.\n\n    Key Takeaways:\n    - The alternating sum needs to be calculated based on the optimal selection of strengths, not just their positions.\n    - Sorting the strengths in descending order is essential for maximizing the alternating sum.\n    - Careful attention to the problem requirements is crucial to avoid logical errors in implementation.\n\n    Final Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def calculate_max_strength(t):\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n, q = map(int, input().split())\n            strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            strengths.sort(reverse=True)\n            max_strength = 0\n            for index in range(n):\n                if index % 2 == 0:\n                    max_strength += strengths[index]\n                else:\n                    max_strength -= strengths[index]\n            print(max_strength)\n\n    t = int(input())\n    calculate_max_strength(t)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and the need for careful implementation to achieve the desired results.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by utilizing a dictionary to group problems based on their calculated difficulty scores. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:\n\n    1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of problems (`p`) and subtasks (`s`) in a single line, which is efficient and straightforward.\n\n    2. **Using a Dictionary for Grouping**: Instead of maintaining a list of tuples for difficulties, the official solution uses a dictionary (`scores`) where the keys are the difficulty scores and the values are lists of problem indices. This allows for efficient grouping and retrieval of problems with the same difficulty.\n\n    3. **Score Calculation**: The solution pairs scores with the number of contestants who solved them using a dictionary (`nsc`). It then sorts the scores and counts the number of valid indices where the number of contestants decreases. This is done using a simple loop that compares adjacent scores.\n\n    4. **Sorting and Output**: After calculating the scores, the solution sorts the keys of the dictionary and then constructs a final list of problem indices in the correct order. This two-step sorting (first by score, then by problem index) ensures that the output meets the problem's requirements.\n\n    5. **Efficiency**: The use of dictionaries and sorting operations is efficient given the constraints, and the overall complexity remains manageable even for the upper limits of the input sizes.\n\n    Overall, the official solution is insightful in its use of data structures to simplify the problem and ensure clarity in the logic. The approach of grouping by difficulty and then sorting is particularly effective for this type of problem.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The initial approach failed primarily due to incorrect handling of the attraction power calculation and the management of magnets and irons when blocked cells were encountered.\n\n    Key strategies that worked included:\n    - Iterating through the string to collect indices of magnets and irons, and processing them in segments separated by blocked cells.\n    - Using a set to track which irons had already been attracted, ensuring that each could only be used once.\n\n    The final solution involved a clear structure where the attraction power was calculated based on the distance and the number of conducting sheets between magnets and irons. The code snippet below represents the final working solution:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_magnets(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, input().split())\n            S = input().strip()\n        \n            magnets = []\n            irons = []\n            count = 0\n        \n            for i in range(N):\n                if S[i] == 'M':\n                    magnets.append(i)\n                elif S[i] == 'I':\n                    irons.append(i)\n                elif S[i] == 'X':\n                    count += process_attractions(magnets, irons, K, S)\n                    magnets.clear()\n                    irons.clear()\n        \n            count += process_attractions(magnets, irons, K, S)\n            print(count)\n\n    def process_attractions(magnets, irons, K, S):\n        count = 0\n        used_irons = set()\n        for m in magnets:\n            for i in irons:\n                if i not in used_irons:\n                    distance = abs(m - i)\n                    sheets = count_sheets_between(S, m, i)\n                    power = K + 1 - distance - sheets\n                    if power > 0:\n                        count += 1\n                        used_irons.add(i)\n                        break\n        return count\n\n    def count_sheets_between(S, m, i):\n        return S[min(m, i) + 1:max(m, i)].count(':')\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the need for careful condition checking and the management of state (used magnets and irons) in problems involving pairing or matching elements based on specific criteria.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The goal was to rearrange the students to minimize this awkwardness.\n\n#### Key Insights:\n1. **Awkwardness Calculation**: The awkwardness can be minimized by grouping all boys together and all girls together. The total awkwardness can be calculated based on the positions of boys and girls in the string.\n2. **Direct Calculation**: Initially, I attempted to derive a formula for awkwardness based on counts of boys and girls, which led to incorrect calculations. The correct approach involves directly summing the distances based on their positions.\n\n#### Strategies and Errors:\n- The first few attempts incorrectly used a formula that did not accurately reflect the distances, leading to negative values for awkwardness.\n- The final approach involved iterating through the string and calculating the total awkwardness based on the arrangement of boys and girls, but I failed to implement this correctly, leading to runtime errors.\n\n#### Final Code Snippet:\nThe correct approach should involve counting boys and girls and calculating the awkwardness based on their positions. However, the implementation was flawed. Here\u2019s a simplified version of the intended logic:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s):\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_g = s.count('g')\n    \n    # Calculate the minimum awkwardness\n    awkwardness = 0\n    # Place all boys first and all girls second\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if s[i] == 'b':\n            awkwardness += count_g * (i - count_b)  # Incorrect logic\n        else:\n            awkwardness += count_b * (i - count_g)  # Incorrect logic\n    \n    return awkwardness\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    s = input().strip()\n    result = calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s)\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe attempts highlighted the importance of correctly understanding the problem requirements and accurately calculating distances. Future attempts should focus on directly summing distances based on the arrangement of boys and girls without relying on potentially flawed formulas."

The primary issue was my misunderstanding of how to calculate the distances between boys and girls effectively. My initial approach relied on incorrect formulas and assumptions about the arrangement of students, which did not yield the expected results.\n\nThe official solution provided a more efficient and accurate method for calculating the minimum awkwardness. Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Counting Characters**: The solution uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of boys ('b') and girls ('g'). This allows for quick access to the number of each type of student.\n\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**: If there is only one type of student (either all boys or all girls), the awkwardness is zero, as there are no pairs to consider.\n\n3. **Calculating Distances**: The solution calculates the minimum and maximum counts of boys and girls. It then derives the left and right distances based on these counts, which helps in determining how to compute the total awkwardness efficiently.\n\n4. **Summation Logic**: The official solution uses a systematic approach to calculate the total awkwardness by iterating through the counts and applying a formula that accounts for the distances between boys and girls. This is done in a way that avoids unnecessary complexity and ensures that all pairwise distances are considered.\n\n5. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient in both time and space, leveraging simple arithmetic operations and loops to achieve the desired result without excessive computations.\n\nIn contrast, my attempts were hindered by incorrect assumptions about the arrangement and distance calculations, leading to runtime errors and incorrect outputs. This experience highlights the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging efficient algorithms for counting and summation tasks. The official solution serves as a valuable reference for future problems involving similar distance calculations and arrangements."
