## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef taught his brother Chefu about right angled triangle and its properties. Chefu says that he has understood everything about right angled triangles. Chef wants to check learning of his brother by asking the following question "Can you find a right angled triangle whose length of hypotenuse  is H and its area is S?"
Chefu is confused how to solve it. I hope you are not. Please solve this by finding a right angled triangle with hypotenuse H and area S. If it not possible to do so, then output -1.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test-cases. T test cases follow.
For each test case, there will be a single line containing two space separated integers H and S.

-----Output-----
Output the answer for each test-case in a single line. If it is not possible to find such a triangle, output -1. Otherwise print 3 real numbers corresponding to the lengths of the sides of the triangle sorted in non-decreasing order. Please note that the length of the triangle sides should not differ by more than 0.01 in absolute value from the correct lengths.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to determine if there exists a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we should return the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible to form such a triangle, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   A right-angled triangle has a hypotenuse \( H \) and two other sides \( a \) and \( b \). The area \( S \) of the triangle can be expressed as \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \). From the Pythagorean theorem, we know that \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \). We can derive \( b \) in terms of \( a \) and \( H \) and substitute it into the area formula to find a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \). We can then solve this quadratic equation to find possible values for \( a \) and subsequently \( b \). If valid values are found, we will sort and return them; otherwise, we will return -1.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_triangle(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           H, S = test_case
           if S * 2 > H * H:
               output -1
               continue
           a = sqrt((H * H) / 2 + sqrt((H * H) * (H * H) / 4 - S * S))
           b = (2 * S) / a
           if a > b:
               swap a and b
           if a^2 + b^2 == H^2:

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to determine the difficulty of programming problems based on their subtasks, which involved calculating how many times the number of contestants solving a subtask decreases as we sort the subtasks by their scores. The solution involved reading input data, processing it to count the valid indices, and then sorting the problems based on their calculated difficulty.

    The core concepts tested in this problem included sorting, tuple manipulation, and counting conditions based on comparisons. The approach I took was to pair scores with the number of contestants, sort these pairs, and then count the valid indices where the number of contestants decreased. This method was efficient given the constraints, particularly since the number of subtasks (S) is relatively small (up to 30), allowing for straightforward comparisons.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was sound, as evidenced by passing the provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution was straightforward without any significant complications. The key takeaway is the importance of careful data structuring and sorting when dealing with problems that require comparative analysis. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def calculate_difficulty(P, S):
        difficulties = []
    
        for i in range(1, P + 1):
            scores = list(map(int, input().split()))
            contestants = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
            paired = sorted(zip(scores, contestants))
        
            count = 0
            for k in range(1, S):
                if paired[k - 1][1] > paired[k][1]:
                    count += 1
        
            difficulties.append((count, i))
    
        difficulties.sort()
    
        for difficulty in difficulties:
            print(difficulty[1])

    P, S = map(int, input().split())
    calculate_difficulty(P, S)
    ```
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element by its index any number of times. The key insight was that the total sum of the sequence must be less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, and it must also be non-negative to reach zero.

    Initially, the solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it could always be made zero. This was a flawed assumption because it did not account for the possibility of the total sum being negative, which would make it impossible to reach zero.

    The corrected approach involved:
    1. Calculating the total sum of the sequence.
    2. Calculating the maximum reduction possible using the formula for the sum of the first `N` natural numbers.
    3. Checking both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction and must be non-negative.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
            total_sum = sum(A)
            max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))
        
            if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    can_make_good_sequence(T)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all conditions that affect the outcome, especially when dealing with sums and reductions.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of finding a permutation \( P \) such that \( f(P) = K \), I learned several key concepts and strategies. The function \( f(P) \) is defined as the sum of the maximums of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \( f(P) \) for a descending permutation is \( N \times (N - 1) \). This insight was crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a given \( K \).

    Initially, my approach to calculating the maximum value and adjusting the permutation was flawed. I incorrectly calculated the maximum possible value and did not implement a clear strategy for adjusting the permutation to reach \( K \). The adjustment logic involved swapping adjacent elements, but it lacked a systematic approach to ensure that the desired \( K \) could be achieved.

    After revising the code, I implemented a more structured approach: I calculated the maximum value correctly, checked if \( K \) was feasible, and then constructed a descending permutation. I iteratively adjusted the permutation by swapping elements while recalculating \( f(P) \) until it matched \( K \) or determined it was impossible.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def find_permutation(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, input().split())
            max_value = N * (N - 1)
        
            if K > max_value:
                print(-1)
                continue
        
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_f = sum(max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1]) for i in range(N - 1))
        
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_f > K:
                    if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:
                        permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                        current_f = sum(max(permutation[j], permutation[j + 1]) for j in range(N - 1))
            
                if current_f == K:
                    break
        
            if current_f == K:
                print(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
            else:
                print(-1)

    T = int(input())
    find_permutation(T)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of clearly understanding the problem constraints and systematically approaching adjustments in permutations.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to determine if it's possible to find a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we need to output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible to form such a triangle, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we can use the properties of right-angled triangles. The area \( S \) of a right-angled triangle can be expressed as \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of the two legs. The hypotenuse \( H \) relates to the legs through the Pythagorean theorem: \( H^2 = a^2 + b^2 \). We can derive \( a \) and \( b \) from these equations and check if they yield valid triangle sides.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_triangle(T):
       for each test case:
           read H and S
           if S is greater than H^2 / 2:
               print -1
               continue
           calculate a and b using the derived formulas:
               a = sqrt(H^2 / 2 + sqrt((H^2 / 2)^2 - S^2))
               b = (2 * S) / a
           if a and b are valid (i.e., they satisfy the triangle conditions):
               print sorted(a, b, H)
           else:
               print -1

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to determine if it's possible to find a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we need to output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible to form such a triangle, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we can use the properties of right-angled triangles. The area \( S \) of a right-angled triangle can be expressed as \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of the two legs. The hypotenuse \( H \) relates to the legs through the Pythagorean theorem: \( H^2 = a^2 + b^2 \). We can derive \( a \) and \( b \) from these equations and check if they yield valid triangle sides.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_triangle(T):
       for each test case:
           read H and S
           if S is greater than H^2 / 2:
               print -1
               continue
           calculate a and b using the derived formulas:
               a = sqrt(H^2 / 2 + sqrt((H^2 / 2)^2 - S^2))
               b = (2 * S) / a
           if a and b are valid (i.e., they satisfy the triangle conditions):

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find two legs \( a \) and \( b \) of a right-angled triangle given the hypotenuse \( H \) and the area \( S \).
   - The area of a right-angled triangle is given by \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \).
   - The relationship between the legs and the hypotenuse is given by \( H^2 = a^2 + b^2 \).

2. **Identifying the Mistakes**:
   - The condition `if S > (H * H) / 2:` is correct because the maximum area for a right triangle with hypotenuse \( H \) is \( \frac{H^2}{2} \). However, this check alone does not guarantee that valid legs \( a \) and \( b \) can be found.
   - The calculation of \( a \) and \( b \) is incorrect. The formula used to derive \( a \) does not correctly reflect the relationship between \( a \), \( b \), and \( H \).
   - The check `if a > 0 and b > 0 and a * a + b * b == H * H:` is not sufficient. We need to ensure that \( a \) and \( b \) satisfy both the area and the Pythagorean theorem.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - We can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) using the area formula: \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \).
   - Substitute \( b \) into the Pythagorean theorem: \( H^2 = a^2 + \left(\frac{2S}{a}\right)^2 \).
   - Rearranging gives us a quadratic equation in terms of \( a^2 \).
   - We can solve this quadratic equation to find valid values for \( a \) and subsequently \( b \).

4. **Revising the Code**:
   - We need to implement the correct calculations and checks to ensure we find valid triangle sides.

Hereâ€™s the revised code that implements the correct logic:

```python
def find_triangle(T):
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the hypotenuse H and area S
        H, S = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Check if the area S is possible with the given hypotenuse H
        if S > (H * H) / 2:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # We need to solve the equation H^2 = a^2 + (2S/a)^2
        # Rearranging gives us a quadratic equation in terms of a^2
        # Let x = a^2, then we have H^2 = x + (4S^2/x)
        # This leads to the quadratic equation: x^2 - H^2 * x + 4S^2 = 0
        
        # Coefficients for the quadratic equation
        A = 1
        B = -H * H
        C = 4 * S * S
        
        # Calculate the discriminant
        D = B * B - 4 * A * C
        
        if D < 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the two possible values for a^2
        sqrt_D = D ** 0.5
        a_squared1 = (-B + sqrt_D) / (2 * A)
        a_squared2 = (-B - sqrt_D) / (2 * A)
        
        # We need to check both solutions
        found = False
        for a_squared in (a_squared1, a_squared2):
            if a_squared > 0:
                a = a_squared ** 0.5
                b = (2 * S) / a
                
                if a > 0 and b > 0 and abs(a * a + b * b - H * H) < 0.01:
                    # Print the sides in non-decreasing order
                    print(f"{min(a, b):.5f} {max(a, b):.5f} {H:.5f}")
                    found = True
                    break
        
        if not found:
            print(-1)

# Read the number of test cases

This code correctly implements the logic to find the sides of the triangle or return -1 if it's not possible.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to determine if it's possible to find a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we need to output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible to form such a triangle, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we can use the properties of right-angled triangles. The area \( S \) of a right-angled triangle can be expressed as \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of the two legs. The hypotenuse \( H \) relates to the legs through the Pythagorean theorem: \( H^2 = a^2 + b^2 \). We can derive \( a \) and \( b \) from these equations and check if they yield valid triangle sides.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_triangle(T):
       for each test case:
           read H and S
           if S is greater than H^2 / 2:
               print -1
               continue
           calculate a and b using the derived formulas:
               a = sqrt(H^2 / 2 + sqrt((H^2 / 2)^2 - S^2))
               b = (2 * S) / a
           if a and b are valid (i.e., they satisfy the triangle conditions):
               print sorted(a, b, H)
           else:
               print -1
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find two legs \( a \) and \( b \) of a right-angled triangle given the hypotenuse \( H \) and the area \( S \).
   - The area of a right-angled triangle is given by \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \).
   - The relationship between the legs and the hypotenuse is given by \( H^2 = a^2 + b^2 \).

2. **Identifying the Mistakes**:
   - The condition `if S > (H * H) / 2:` is correct because the maximum area for a right triangle with hypotenuse \( H \) is \( \frac{H^2}{2} \). However, this check alone does not guarantee that valid legs \( a \) and \( b \) can be found.
   - The calculation of \( a \) and \( b \) is incorrect. The formula used to derive \( a \) does not correctly reflect the relationship between \( a \), \( b \), and \( H \).
   - The check `if a > 0 and b > 0 and a * a + b * b == H * H:` is not sufficient. We need to ensure that \( a \) and \( b \) satisfy both the area and the Pythagorean theorem.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - We can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) using the area formula: \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \).
   - Substitute \( b \) into the Pythagorean theorem: \( H^2 = a^2 + \left(\frac{2S}{a}\right)^2 \).
   - Rearranging gives us a quadratic equation in terms of \( a^2 \).
   - We can solve this quadratic equation to find valid values for \( a \) and subsequently \( b \).

4. **Revising the Code**:
   - We need to implement the correct calculations and checks to ensure we find valid triangle sides.

Hereâ€™s the revised code that implements the correct logic:

```python
def find_triangle(T):
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the hypotenuse H and area S
        H, S = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Check if the area S is possible with the given hypotenuse H
        if S > (H * H) / 2:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # We need to solve the equation H^2 = a^2 + (2S/a)^2
        # Rearranging gives us a quadratic equation in terms of a^2
        # Let x = a^2, then we have H^2 = x + (4S^2/x)
        # This leads to the quadratic equation: x^2 - H^2 * x + 4S^2 = 0
        
        # Coefficients for the quadratic equation
        A = 1
        B = -H * H
        C = 4 * S * S
        
        # Calculate the discriminant
        D = B * B - 4 * A * C
        
        if D < 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the two possible values for a^2
        sqrt_D = D ** 0.5
        a_squared1 = (-B + sqrt_D) / (2 * A)
        a_squared2 = (-B - sqrt_D) / (2 * A)
        
        # We need to check both solutions
        found = False
        for a_squared in (a_squared1, a_squared2):
            if a_squared > 0:
                a = a_squared ** 0.5
                b = (2 * S) / a
                
                if a > 0 and b > 0 and abs(a * a + b * b - H * H) < 0.01:
                    # Print the sides in non-decreasing order
                    print(f"{min(a, b):.5f} {max(a, b):.5f} {H:.5f}")
                    found = True
                    break
        
        if not found:
            print(-1)

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
find_triangle(T)
``` 

This code correctly implements the logic to find the sides of the triangle or return -1 if it's not possible.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element by its index any number of times. The key insight was that the total sum of the sequence must be less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, and it must also be non-negative to reach zero.

    Initially, the solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it could always be made zero. This was a flawed assumption because it did not account for the possibility of the total sum being negative, which would make it impossible to reach zero.

    The corrected approach involved:
    1. Calculating the total sum of the sequence.
    2. Calculating the maximum reduction possible using the formula for the sum of the first `N` natural numbers.
    3. Checking both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction and must be non-negative.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
            total_sum = sum(A)
            max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))
        
            if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    can_make_good_sequence(T)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all conditions that affect the outcome, especially when dealing with sums and reductions.

[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of finding a permutation \( P \) such that \( f(P) = K \), I learned several key concepts and strategies. The function \( f(P) \) is defined as the sum of the maximums of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \( f(P) \) for a descending permutation is \( N \times (N - 1) \). This insight was crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a given \( K \).

    Initially, my approach to calculating the maximum value and adjusting the permutation was flawed. I incorrectly calculated the maximum possible value and did not implement a clear strategy for adjusting the permutation to reach \( K \). The adjustment logic involved swapping adjacent elements, but it lacked a systematic approach to ensure that the desired \( K \) could be achieved.

    After revising the code, I implemented a more structured approach: I calculated the maximum value correctly, checked if \( K \) was feasible, and then constructed a descending permutation. I iteratively adjusted the permutation by swapping elements while recalculating \( f(P) \) until it matched \( K \) or determined it was impossible.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def find_permutation(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, input().split())
            max_value = N * (N - 1)
        
            if K > max_value:
                print(-1)
                continue
        
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_f = sum(max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1]) for i in range(N - 1))
        
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_f > K:
                    if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:
                        permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                        current_f = sum(max(permutation[j], permutation[j + 1]) for j in range(N - 1))
            
                if current_f == K:
                    break
        
            if current_f == K:
                print(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
            else:
                print(-1)

    T = int(input())
    find_permutation(T)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of clearly understanding the problem constraints and systematically approaching adjustments in permutations.

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the problems created by his setters, the number of problems needed for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the available days to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging simple loops and arithmetic.

    The final implementation was clean and efficient, successfully passing all provided test cases. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all edge cases (like having fewer problems than needed for a single contest) are considered. The solution was implemented without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints given. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def max_contests(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    max_contests(T)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of clear problem understanding and systematic solution development.

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Quadratic Equation**: The code now correctly derives and solves the quadratic equation based on the relationships between the sides and the area.
2. **Validation of Sides**: It checks both possible values for \( a^2 \) and ensures that the calculated sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.
3. **Output Formatting**: The output is formatted to five decimal places as required.

This code should now correctly handle the input cases and provide the expected output.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to determine if it's possible to find a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we need to output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible to form such a triangle, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we can use the properties of right-angled triangles. The area \( S \) of a right-angled triangle can be expressed as \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of the two legs. The hypotenuse \( H \) relates to the legs through the Pythagorean theorem: \( H^2 = a^2 + b^2 \). We can derive \( a \) and \( b \) from these equations and check if they yield valid triangle sides.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_triangle(T):
       for each test case:
           read H and S
           if S is greater than H^2 / 2:
               print -1
               continue
           calculate a and b using the derived formulas:
               a = sqrt(H^2 / 2 + sqrt((H^2 / 2)^2 - S^2))
               b = (2 * S) / a
           if a and b are valid (i.e., they satisfy the triangle conditions):
               print sorted(a, b, H)

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find two legs \( a \) and \( b \) of a right-angled triangle given the hypotenuse \( H \) and the area \( S \).
   - The area of a right-angled triangle is given by \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \).
   - The relationship between the legs and the hypotenuse is given by \( H^2 = a^2 + b^2 \).

2. **Identifying the Mistakes**:
   - The condition `if S > (H * H) / 2:` is correct because the maximum area for a right triangle with hypotenuse \( H \) is \( \frac{H^2}{2} \). However, this check alone does not guarantee that valid legs \( a \) and \( b \) can be found.
   - The calculation of \( a \) and \( b \) is incorrect. The formula used to derive \( a \) does not correctly reflect the relationship between \( a \), \( b \), and \( H \).
   - The check `if a > 0 and b > 0 and a * a + b * b == H * H:` is not sufficient. We need to ensure that \( a \) and \( b \) satisfy both the area and the Pythagorean theorem.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - We can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) using the area formula: \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \).
   - Substitute \( b \) into the Pythagorean theorem: \( H^2 = a^2 + \left(\frac{2S}{a}\right)^2 \).
   - Rearranging gives us a quadratic equation in terms of \( a^2 \).
   - We can solve this quadratic equation to find valid values for \( a \) and subsequently \( b \).

4. **Revising the Code**:
   - We need to implement the correct calculations and checks to ensure we find valid triangle sides.

Hereâ€™s the revised code that implements the correct logic:

```python
def find_triangle(T):

                b = (2 * S) / a

                    # Print the sides in non-decreasing order

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine if a right-angled triangle could be formed with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \). The key concepts involved the relationships defined by the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle. 

Initially, the approach involved checking if the area \( S \) exceeded the maximum possible area for a triangle with hypotenuse \( H \). However, the calculations for the triangle's legs \( a \) and \( b \) were incorrect. The correct method required deriving a quadratic equation from the relationships between the sides and solving it to find valid values for \( a \) and \( b \).

The final solution involved:
1. Formulating the quadratic equation based on the relationships \( H^2 = a^2 + b^2 \) and \( S = \frac{1}{2}ab \).
2. Solving the quadratic equation to find potential values for \( a^2 \).
3. Validating the calculated sides against the Pythagorean theorem and ensuring they were positive.

The final code successfully handled the input cases and produced the expected output, demonstrating the importance of correctly deriving and solving mathematical relationships in programming problems.

Hereâ€™s the final working code snippet for reference:

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef taught his brother Chefu about right angled triangle and its properties. Chefu says that he has understood everything about right angled triangles. Chef wants to check learning of his brother by asking the following question "Can you find a right angled triangle whose length of hypotenuse  is H and its area is S?"
Chefu is confused how to solve it. I hope you are not. Please solve this by finding a right angled triangle with hypotenuse H and area S. If it not possible to do so, then output -1.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test-cases. T test cases follow.
For each test case, there will be a single line containing two space separated integers H and S.

-----Output-----
Output the answer for each test-case in a single line. If it is not possible to find such a triangle, output -1. Otherwise print 3 real numbers corresponding to the lengths of the sides of the triangle sorted in non-decreasing order. Please note that the length of the triangle sides should not differ by more than 0.01 in absolute value from the correct lengths.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to determine if it's possible to find a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we need to output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible to form such a triangle, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we can use the properties of right-angled triangles. The area \( S \) of a right-angled triangle can be expressed as \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of the two legs. The hypotenuse \( H \) relates to the legs through the Pythagorean theorem: \( H^2 = a^2 + b^2 \). We can derive \( a \) and \( b \) from these equations and check if they yield valid triangle sides.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_triangle(T):
       for each test case:
           read H and S
           if S is greater than H^2 / 2:
               print -1
               continue
           calculate a and b using the derived formulas:
               a = sqrt(H^2 / 2 + sqrt((H^2 / 2)^2 - S^2))
               b = (2 * S) / a
           if a and b are valid (i.e., they satisfy the triangle conditions):
               print sorted(a, b, H)
           else:
               print -1

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find two legs \( a \) and \( b \) of a right-angled triangle given the hypotenuse \( H \) and the area \( S \).
   - The area of a right-angled triangle is given by \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \).
   - The relationship between the legs and the hypotenuse is given by \( H^2 = a^2 + b^2 \).

2. **Identifying the Mistakes**:
   - The condition `if S > (H * H) / 2:` is correct because the maximum area for a right triangle with hypotenuse \( H \) is \( \frac{H^2}{2} \). However, this check alone does not guarantee that valid legs \( a \) and \( b \) can be found.
   - The calculation of \( a \) and \( b \) is incorrect. The formula used to derive \( a \) does not correctly reflect the relationship between \( a \), \( b \), and \( H \).
   - The check `if a > 0 and b > 0 and a * a + b * b == H * H:` is not sufficient. We need to ensure that \( a \) and \( b \) satisfy both the area and the Pythagorean theorem.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - We can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) using the area formula: \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \).
   - Substitute \( b \) into the Pythagorean theorem: \( H^2 = a^2 + \left(\frac{2S}{a}\right)^2 \).
   - Rearranging gives us a quadratic equation in terms of \( a^2 \).
   - We can solve this quadratic equation to find valid values for \( a \) and subsequently \( b \).

4. **Revising the Code**:
   - We need to implement the correct calculations and checks to ensure we find valid triangle sides.

Hereâ€™s the revised code that implements the correct logic:

```python

    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the hypotenuse H and area S
        H, S = map(int, input().split())

        if S > (H * H) / 2:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # We need to solve the equation H^2 = a^2 + (2S/a)^2
        # Rearranging gives us a quadratic equation in terms of a^2
        # Let x = a^2, then we have H^2 = x + (4S^2/x)
        # This leads to the quadratic equation: x^2 - H^2 * x + 4S^2 = 0
        
        # Coefficients for the quadratic equation
        A = 1
        B = -H * H

        sqrt_D = D ** 0.5
        a_squared1 = (-B + sqrt_D) / (2 * A)
        a_squared2 = (-B - sqrt_D) / (2 * A)

            if a_squared > 0:
                a = a_squared ** 0.5
                b = (2 * S) / a
                
                if a > 0 and b > 0 and abs(a * a + b * b - H * H) < 0.01:
                    # Print the sides in non-decreasing order
                    print(f"{min(a, b):.5f} {max(a, b):.5f} {H:.5f}")
                    found = True

        if not found:
            print(-1)

Hereâ€™s the corrected Python code:

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] In reflecting on the problem-solving experience, I learned several key insights regarding the approach to finding the sides of a right-angled triangle given the hypotenuse and area.

### Key Insights:
1. **Quadratic Equation Derivation**: The official solution effectively simplifies the problem by deriving a condition based on the relationship between the hypotenuse \( H \) and the area \( S \). It checks if the expression \( (H^4 - 16S^2) < 0 \) holds, which directly indicates the impossibility of forming such a triangle. This is a more efficient check than my initial approach, which involved solving a quadratic equation.

2. **Use of Mathematical Functions**: The official solution utilizes the `math.sqrt` function to compute the necessary values for the triangle's legs. This is a straightforward approach that ensures precision in calculations, especially when dealing with square roots.

3. **Output Formatting**: The official solution formats the output to six decimal places, which is a good practice for ensuring consistency and precision in numerical outputs.

4. **Logical Flow**: The official solution maintains a clear and concise flow, iterating through test cases and applying the necessary checks and calculations in a structured manner. This clarity helps in understanding the logic and ensures that all edge cases are handled effectively.

### Comparison with My Approach:
- My approach involved solving a quadratic equation derived from the relationships between the sides, which was more complex and less efficient than the direct condition used in the official solution.
- I also included checks for the validity of the triangle sides after calculating them, which added unnecessary complexity. The official solution's method of checking the feasibility upfront simplifies the logic significantly.

### Conclusion:
The official solution provides a more efficient and elegant approach to solving the problem. It emphasizes the importance of deriving conditions that can quickly determine the feasibility of a solution, rather than delving into more complex calculations unless necessary. This experience highlights the value of simplicity and clarity in problem-solving.
