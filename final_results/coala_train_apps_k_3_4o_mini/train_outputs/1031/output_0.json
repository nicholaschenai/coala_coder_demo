    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The task is to determine if it's possible to find a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse length \\( H \\) and area \\( S \\). If such a triangle exists, we need to output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible to form such a triangle, we should return -1.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we can use the properties of right-angled triangles. The area \\( S \\) of a right-angled triangle can be expressed as \\( S = \\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times b \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the lengths of the two legs. The hypotenuse \\( H \\) relates to the legs through the Pythagorean theorem: \\( H^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\). We can derive \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) from these equations and check if they yield valid triangle sides.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_triangle(T):\n       for each test case:\n           read H and S\n           if S is greater than H^2 / 2:\n               print -1\n               continue\n           calculate a and b using the derived formulas:\n               a = sqrt(H^2 / 2 + sqrt((H^2 / 2)^2 - S^2))\n               b = (2 * S) / a\n           if a and b are valid (i.e., they satisfy the triangle conditions):\n               print sorted(a, b, H)\n           else:\n               print -1\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_triangle(T):\n    for _ in range(T):\n        # Read the hypotenuse H and area S\n        H, S = map(int, input().split())\n        \n        # Check if the area S is possible with the given hypotenuse H\n        if S > (H * H) / 2:\n            print(-1)\n            continue\n        \n        # Calculate the legs a and b using derived formulas\n        # a^2 + b^2 = H^2 and a * b = 2 * S\n        # We can derive a and b from these equations\n        a = ((H * H) / 2 + ((H * H) / 2) ** 0.5) ** 0.5\n        b = (2 * S) / a\n        \n        # Check if a and b are valid\n        if a > 0 and b > 0 and a * a + b * b == H * H:\n            # Print the sides in non-decreasing order\n            print(f\"{min(a, b):.5f} {max(a, b):.5f} {H:.5f}\")\n        else:\n            print(-1)\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nfind_triangle(T)\n```",
