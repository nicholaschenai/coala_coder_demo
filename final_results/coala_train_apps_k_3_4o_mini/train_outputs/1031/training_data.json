    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to determine if a right-angled triangle could be formed with a given hypotenuse \\( H \\) and area \\( S \\). The key concepts involved the relationships defined by the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle. \n\nInitially, the approach involved checking if the area \\( S \\) exceeded the maximum possible area for a triangle with hypotenuse \\( H \\).

    "reflection": "In reflecting on the problem-solving experience, I learned several key insights regarding the approach to finding the sides of a right-angled triangle given the hypotenuse and area.\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Quadratic Equation Derivation**: The official solution effectively simplifies the problem by deriving a condition based on the relationship between the hypotenuse \\( H \\) and the area \\( S \\). It checks if the expression \\( (H^4 - 16S^2) < 0 \\) holds, which directly indicates the impossibility of forming such a triangle. This is a more efficient check than my initial approach, which involved solving a quadratic equation.\n\n2. **Use of Mathematical Functions**: The official solution utilizes the `math.sqrt` function to compute the necessary values for the triangle's legs. This is a straightforward approach that ensures precision in calculations, especially when dealing with square roots.\n\n3. **Output Formatting**: The official solution formats the output to six decimal places, which is a good practice for ensuring consistency and precision in numerical outputs.\n\n4. **Logical Flow**: The official solution maintains a clear and concise flow, iterating through test cases and applying the necessary checks and calculations in a structured manner. This clarity helps in understanding the logic and ensures that all edge cases are handled effectively.\n\n### Comparison with My Approach:\n- My approach involved solving a quadratic equation derived from the relationships between the sides, which was more complex and less efficient than the direct condition used in the official solution.\n- I also included checks for the validity of the triangle sides after calculating them, which added unnecessary complexity. The official solution's method of checking the feasibility upfront simplifies the logic significantly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe official solution provides a more efficient and elegant approach to solving the problem. It emphasizes the importance of deriving conditions that can quickly determine the feasibility of a solution, rather than delving into more complex calculations unless necessary. This experience highlights the value of simplicity and clarity in problem-solving.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: find_triangle]\nThe function processes multiple test cases to determine the sides of a right triangle given its hypotenuse and area. For each test case, it first checks if the area is feasible with the provided hypotenuse; if not, it outputs -1. It then formulates a quadratic equation based on the relationship between the sides and the hypotenuse, calculating the discriminant to find potential side lengths. If valid side lengths are found that satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, they are printed in non-decreasing order; otherwise, -1 is printed. The function ensures that the calculations are precise and handles edge cases where no valid triangle can be formed. Overall, it efficiently determines the triangle's dimensions or indicates impossibility based on the input parameters.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to determine the feasibility of constructing a right-angled triangle given specific constraints on the hypotenuse and area. It can be applied in mathematical problem-solving, programming contests, and educational settings where geometry and algebra intersect. Understanding how to manipulate equations related to triangles can also aid in fields such as physics, engineering, and computer graphics, where geometric calculations are essential."
