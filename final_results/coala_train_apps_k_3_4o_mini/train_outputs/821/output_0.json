Each interval can only be colored one way, and we need to determine the optimal coloring for multiple test cases.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To maximize the green area, we should look for overlaps between intervals. If two intervals overlap, we can color one blue and the other yellow to create a green area. The strategy involves sorting the intervals and then iterating through them to determine overlaps. We can keep track of the last colored interval and decide the color of the current interval based on whether it overlaps with the last one.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read number of intervals n\n           read intervals into a list\n           sort intervals by their starting point\n           initialize a result string\n           last_color = None\n           for each interval in intervals:\n               if last_color is None:\n                   color the interval blue\n                   last_color = blue\n               else if interval overlaps with last colored interval:\n                   color the interval yellow\n                   last_color = yellow\n               else:\n                   color the interval blue\n                   last_color = blue\n           append the result string for this test_case\n       return all result strings\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef maximize_green_intervals(T):\n    results = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        n = int(input())\n        intervals = []\n        for __ in range(n):\n            L, R = map(int, input().split())\n            intervals.append((L, R))\n        \n        # Sort intervals by their starting point\n        intervals.sort()\n        \n        result = []\n        last_color = None\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            if last_color is None:\n                # Color the first interval blue\n                result.append('0')\n                last_color = '0'\n            else:\n                # Check for overlap with the last colored interval\n                if intervals[i][0] < intervals[i-1][1]:\n                    # Overlap detected, color this interval yellow\n                    result.append('1')\n                    last_color = '1'\n                else:\n                    # No overlap, color this interval blue\n                    result.append('0')\n                    last_color = '0'\n        \n        # Join the result for this test case and add to results\n        results.append(''.join(result))\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    print('\\n'.join(results))\n\nT = int(input())\nmaximize_green_intervals(T)\n```",
