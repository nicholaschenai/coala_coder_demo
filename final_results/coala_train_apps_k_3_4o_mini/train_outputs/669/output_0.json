    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:\n   The problem involves determining how many different paths Ryan can take through a network of cities connected by roads, given specific conditions about where he must be at certain times. Ryan starts in city 1 and can move to adjacent cities or stay in his current city. We need to count the number of valid paths that satisfy all given conditions after a specified number of seconds.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:\n   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways Ryan can be in each city at each second. We will maintain a 2D array where the rows represent the time (from 0 to K) and the columns represent the cities (from 1 to N). For each second, we will update the number of ways to reach each city based on the number of ways to reach adjacent cities in the previous second. After processing all seconds, we will check the conditions to ensure Ryan is in the required cities at the specified times and count the valid paths.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):\n       initialize dp array of size (K+1) x (N+1) with all zeros\n       dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0\n\n       for time from 1 to K:\n           for each city from 1 to N:\n               for each road (u, v):\n                   if city is u:\n                       dp[time][v] += dp[time-1][u]\n                   if city is v:\n                       dp[time][u] += dp[time-1][v]\n\n       # Check conditions\n       valid_paths = 1\n       for each condition (a_i, b_i):\n           valid_paths *= dp[b_i][a_i]\n           valid_paths %= (10^9 + 7)\n\n       return valid_paths\n\n   function main():\n       read T\n       for each test case:\n           read N, M, K\n           read roads\n           read Q\n           read conditions\n           result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)\n           print(result)\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python Code**:\n```python\ndef count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    # Initialize the dp array\n    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]\n    dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0\n\n    # Create adjacency list for roads\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]\n    for u, v in roads:\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    # Fill the dp array\n    for time in range(1, K + 1):\n        for city in range(1, N + 1):\n            for neighbor in adj[city]:\n                dp[time][neighbor] = (dp[time][neighbor] + dp[time - 1][city]) % MOD\n\n    # Check conditions\n    valid_paths = 1\n    for a_i, b_i in conditions:\n        valid_paths = (valid_paths * dp[b_i][a_i]) % MOD\n\n    return valid_paths\n\ndef main():\n    T = int(input())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, M, K = map(int, input().split())\n        roads = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(M)]\n        Q = int(input())\n        conditions = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(Q)]\n        result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)\n        print(result)\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThis code initializes a dynamic programming table to track the number of ways to reach each city at each second, updates the table based on the roads, and finally checks the conditions to count the valid paths.
