These cities are numbered 1$1$ through N$N$ and connected by M$M$ bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.\nInitially, Ryan is in city 1$1$. At each of the following K$K$ seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has Q$Q$ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),\u2026,(aQ,bQ)$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \\ldots, (a_Q, b_Q)$ meaning that during this K$K$-second trip, for each valid i$i$, he wants to be in city ai$a_i$ after exactly bi$b_i$ seconds.\nSince you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,\u2026,K$1, 2, \\ldots, K$ seconds.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases.

The key insights were that if the total demand from all minions exceeds K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and if the total demand equals K, he can distribute the money exactly.\n\n    Initially, I implemented a solution that simply checked if the total demand was greater than, equal to, or less than K. However, this approach failed to account for the scenario where the total demand was less than K but could still be distributed in a way that Gru ends up with zero. The logic needed to ensure that Gru could fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.\n\n    The correct approach involves:\n    1. Calculating the total demand.\n    2. Checking if the total demand exceeds K (output \"NO\").\n    3. If the total demand equals K, output \"YES\".\n    4. If the total demand is less than K, output \"NO\" since Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.\n\n    The final code snippet that captures this logic is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, input().split())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n            total_demand = sum(A)\n        \n            if total_demand > K:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            elif total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    can_distribute_money(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the conditions under which money can be distributed and ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution provides a more efficient and straightforward approach to solving the problem of counting subsets with specific conditions. Here are the key insights and steps distilled from the official solution:\n\n    1. **Understanding the Conditions**: The official solution correctly identifies that if \\( K > I \\), the count of valid subsets is zero since there cannot be \\( K \\) elements in a subset if \\( I \\) is the \\( K \\)-th element.\n\n    2. **Efficient Calculation of Combinations**: Instead of using factorials directly, the official solution calculates combinations using a loop to avoid large intermediate values. This is done by iteratively multiplying and dividing to compute \\( C(I-1, K-1) \\) without explicitly calculating factorials, which can be computationally expensive.\n\n    3. **Power of Two for Remaining Elements**: The solution efficiently calculates the number of ways to choose any subset from the remaining elements greater than \\( I \\) using \\( 2^{(N-I)} \\). This is a direct application of the power set concept.\n\n    4. **Modular Arithmetic**: The final result is computed modulo \\( 10^9 + 7 \\) to handle large numbers, ensuring that the solution remains within the bounds of typical integer operations in programming.\n\n    5. **Iterative Approach**: The solution processes each query in a loop, maintaining clarity and efficiency. It avoids unnecessary function calls and keeps the logic straightforward.\n\n    Overall, the official solution is effective due to its use of iterative calculations for combinations, direct handling of edge cases, and efficient power calculations. This approach minimizes the risk of overflow and optimizes performance, especially given the constraints of the problem. \n\n    In future implementations, I will consider using similar iterative methods for combinations and powers to enhance efficiency and clarity in my solutions.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The logic for updating the number of ways to reach each city based on its neighbors is flawed. Specifically, the code does not correctly account for the fact that Ryan can also stay in the same city.\n   - The adjacency list is created correctly, but the way we update the `dp` values does not consider the staying option.\n\n4. **Checking Conditions**:\n   - The logic for checking the conditions is correct, but if the `dp` table is not filled correctly, the results will be incorrect.\n\n5. **Identifying the Mistake**:\n   - The main mistake is in the way the `dp` table is updated. We need to ensure that for each city, we consider both moving to adjacent cities and staying in the same city.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. **Update the DP Table**:\n   - For each city, we need to add the number of ways to stay in the same city from the previous time step.\n   - We also need to ensure that we are correctly iterating through all cities and their neighbors.\n\n2. **Revised Pseudocode**:\n   ```\n   function count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):\n       initialize dp array of size (K+1) x (N+1) with all zeros\n       dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0\n\n       for time from 1 to K:\n           for each city from 1 to N:\n               dp[time][city] += dp[time-1][city]  # Stay in the same city\n               for each neighbor in adj[city]:\n                   dp[time][neighbor] += dp[time-1][city]  # Move to neighbor\n                   dp[time][neighbor] %= MOD  # Ensure we take modulo\n\n       # Check conditions\n       valid_paths = 1\n       for each condition (a_i, b_i):\n           valid_paths *= dp[b_i][a_i]\n           valid_paths %= MOD\n\n       return valid_paths\n   ```\n\n3. **Final Python Code**:\n```python\ndef count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    # Initialize the dp array\n    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]\n    dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0\n\n    # Create adjacency list for roads\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]\n    for u, v in roads:\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    # Fill the dp array\n    for time in range(1, K + 1):\n        for city in range(1, N + 1):\n            dp[time][city] = dp[time - 1][city]  # Stay in the same city\n            for neighbor in adj[city]:\n                dp[time][neighbor] = (dp[time][neighbor] + dp[time - 1][city]) % MOD\n\n    # Check conditions\n    valid_paths = 1\n    for a_i, b_i in conditions:\n        valid_paths = (valid_paths * dp[b_i][a_i]) % MOD\n\n    return valid_paths\n\ndef main():\n    T = int(input())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, M, K = map(int, input().split())\n        roads = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(M)]\n        Q = int(input())\n        conditions = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(Q)]\n        result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)\n        print(result)\n\nmain()\n```\n\n### Summary of Changes:\n- The `dp` table is now updated to include the option of staying in the same city.\n- The modulo operation is applied correctly to prevent overflow.\n- The overall structure remains the same, but the logic for filling the `dp` table is corrected. \n\nThis should resolve the issues and allow the code to pass all tests."

The key insights were that if the total demand from all minions exceeds K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and if the total demand equals K, he can distribute the money exactly.\n\n    Initially, I implemented a solution that simply checked if the total demand was greater than, equal to, or less than K. However, this approach failed to account for the scenario where the total demand was less than K but could still be distributed in a way that Gru ends up with zero. The logic needed to ensure that Gru could fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.\n\n    The correct approach involves:\n    1. Calculating the total demand.\n    2. Checking if the total demand exceeds K (output \"NO\").\n    3. If the total demand equals K, output \"YES\".\n    4. If the total demand is less than K, output \"NO\" since Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.\n\n    The final code snippet that captures this logic is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, input().split())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n            total_demand = sum(A)\n        \n            if total_demand > K:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            elif total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    can_distribute_money(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the conditions under which money can be distributed and ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In solving the problem of finding a permutation \\( P \\) such that \\( f(P) = K \\), I learned several key concepts and strategies. The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximums of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a descending permutation is \\( N \\times (N - 1) \\). This insight was crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a given \\( K \\).\n\n    Initially, my approach to calculating the maximum value and adjusting the permutation was flawed. I incorrectly calculated the maximum possible value and did not implement a clear strategy for adjusting the permutation to reach \\( K \\). The adjustment logic involved swapping adjacent elements, but it lacked a systematic approach to ensure that the desired \\( K \\) could be achieved.\n\n    After revising the code, I implemented a more structured approach: I calculated the maximum value correctly, checked if \\( K \\) was feasible, and then constructed a descending permutation. I iteratively adjusted the permutation by swapping elements while recalculating \\( f(P) \\) until it matched \\( K \\) or determined it was impossible.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, input().split())\n            max_value = N * (N - 1)\n        \n            if K > max_value:\n                print(-1)\n                continue\n        \n            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n            current_f = sum(max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1]) for i in range(N - 1))\n        \n            for i in range(N - 1):\n                if current_f > K:\n                    if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:\n                        permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                        current_f = sum(max(permutation[j], permutation[j + 1]) for j in range(N - 1))\n            \n                if current_f == K:\n                    break\n        \n            if current_f == K:\n                print(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n            else:\n                print(-1)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    find_permutation(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of clearly understanding the problem constraints and systematically approaching adjustments in permutations.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

We need to ensure that for each city, we consider both moving to adjacent cities and staying in the same city correctly.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. **Update the DP Table**:\n   - For each city, we need to add the number of ways to stay in the same city from the previous time step.\n   - We also need to ensure that we are correctly iterating through all cities and their neighbors.\n\n2. **Revised Pseudocode**:\n   ```\n   function count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):\n       initialize dp array of size (K+1) x (N+1) with all zeros\n       dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0\n\n       for time from 1 to K:\n           for each city from 1 to N:\n               dp[time][city] += dp[time-1][city]  # Stay in the same city\n               for each neighbor in adj[city]:\n                   dp[time][neighbor] += dp[time-1][city]  # Move to neighbor\n                   dp[time][neighbor] %= MOD  # Ensure we take modulo\n\n       # Check conditions\n       valid_paths = 1\n       for each condition (a_i, b_i):\n           valid_paths *= dp[b_i][a_i]\n           valid_paths %= MOD\n\n       return valid_paths\n   ```\n\n3. **Final Python Code**:\n```python\ndef count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    # Initialize the dp array\n    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]\n    dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0\n\n    # Create adjacency list for roads\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]\n    for u, v in roads:\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    # Fill the dp array\n    for time in range(1, K + 1):\n        for city in range(1, N + 1):\n            dp[time][city] = dp[time - 1][city]  # Stay in the same city\n            for neighbor in adj[city]:\n                dp[time][city] = (dp[time][city] + dp[time - 1][neighbor]) % MOD  # Move to neighbor\n\n    # Check conditions\n    valid_paths = 1\n    for a_i, b_i in conditions:\n        valid_paths = (valid_paths * dp[b_i][a_i]) % MOD\n\n    return valid_paths\n\ndef main():\n    T = int(input())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, M, K = map(int, input().split())\n        roads = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(M)]\n        Q = int(input())\n        conditions = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(Q)]\n        result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)\n        print(result)\n\nmain()\n```\n\n### Key Changes Made:\n1. **Staying in the Same City**: The `dp` table now correctly accounts for the option of Ryan staying in the same city at each time step.\n2. **Correct Neighbor Updates**: The update for moving to neighbors is now correctly implemented, ensuring that all paths are counted.\n3. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is applied consistently to prevent overflow issues.\n\nThis code should now correctly compute the number of valid paths Ryan can take while satisfying the given conditions."

The key insights were that if the total demand from all minions exceeds K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and if the total demand equals K, he can distribute the money exactly.\n\n    Initially, I implemented a solution that simply checked if the total demand was greater than, equal to, or less than K. However, this approach failed to account for the scenario where the total demand was less than K but could still be distributed in a way that Gru ends up with zero. The logic needed to ensure that Gru could fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.\n\n    The correct approach involves:\n    1. Calculating the total demand.\n    2. Checking if the total demand exceeds K (output \"NO\").\n    3. If the total demand equals K, output \"YES\".\n    4. If the total demand is less than K, output \"NO\" since Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.\n\n    The final code snippet that captures this logic is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, input().split())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n            total_demand = sum(A)\n        \n            if total_demand > K:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            elif total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    can_distribute_money(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the conditions under which money can be distributed and ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution provides a more efficient and straightforward approach to solving the problem of counting subsets with specific conditions. Here are the key insights and steps distilled from the official solution:\n\n    1. **Understanding the Conditions**: The official solution correctly identifies that if \\( K > I \\), the count of valid subsets is zero since there cannot be \\( K \\) elements in a subset if \\( I \\) is the \\( K \\)-th element.\n\n    2. **Efficient Calculation of Combinations**: Instead of using factorials directly, the official solution calculates combinations using a loop to avoid large intermediate values. This is done by iteratively multiplying and dividing to compute \\( C(I-1, K-1) \\) without explicitly calculating factorials, which can be computationally expensive.\n\n    3. **Power of Two for Remaining Elements**: The solution efficiently calculates the number of ways to choose any subset from the remaining elements greater than \\( I \\) using \\( 2^{(N-I)} \\). This is a direct application of the power set concept.\n\n    4. **Modular Arithmetic**: The final result is computed modulo \\( 10^9 + 7 \\) to handle large numbers, ensuring that the solution remains within the bounds of typical integer operations in programming.\n\n    5. **Iterative Approach**: The solution processes each query in a loop, maintaining clarity and efficiency. It avoids unnecessary function calls and keeps the logic straightforward.\n\n    Overall, the official solution is effective due to its use of iterative calculations for combinations, direct handling of edge cases, and efficient power calculations. This approach minimizes the risk of overflow and optimizes performance, especially given the constraints of the problem. \n\n    In future implementations, I will consider using similar iterative methods for combinations and powers to enhance efficiency and clarity in my solutions.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The key insights were that if the total demand from all minions exceeds K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and if the total demand equals K, he can distribute the money exactly.\n\n    Initially, I implemented a solution that simply checked if the total demand was greater than, equal to, or less than K. However, this approach failed to account for the scenario where the total demand was less than K but could still be distributed in a way that Gru ends up with zero. The logic needed to ensure that Gru could fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.\n\n    The correct approach involves:\n    1. Calculating the total demand.\n    2. Checking if the total demand exceeds K (output \"NO\").\n    3. If the total demand equals K, output \"YES\".\n    4. If the total demand is less than K, output \"NO\" since Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.\n\n    The final code snippet that captures this logic is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, input().split())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n            total_demand = sum(A)\n        \n            if total_demand > K:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            elif total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    can_distribute_money(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the conditions under which money can be distributed and ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution provides a more efficient and straightforward approach to solving the problem of counting subsets with specific conditions. Here are the key insights and steps distilled from the official solution:\n\n    1. **Understanding the Conditions**: The official solution correctly identifies that if \\( K > I \\), the count of valid subsets is zero since there cannot be \\( K \\) elements in a subset if \\( I \\) is the \\( K \\)-th element.\n\n    2. **Efficient Calculation of Combinations**: Instead of using factorials directly, the official solution calculates combinations using a loop to avoid large intermediate values. This is done by iteratively multiplying and dividing to compute \\( C(I-1, K-1) \\) without explicitly calculating factorials, which can be computationally expensive.\n\n    3. **Power of Two for Remaining Elements**: The solution efficiently calculates the number of ways to choose any subset from the remaining elements greater than \\( I \\) using \\( 2^{(N-I)} \\). This is a direct application of the power set concept.\n\n    4. **Modular Arithmetic**: The final result is computed modulo \\( 10^9 + 7 \\) to handle large numbers, ensuring that the solution remains within the bounds of typical integer operations in programming.\n\n    5. **Iterative Approach**: The solution processes each query in a loop, maintaining clarity and efficiency. It avoids unnecessary function calls and keeps the logic straightforward.\n\n    Overall, the official solution is effective due to its use of iterative calculations for combinations, direct handling of edge cases, and efficient power calculations. This approach minimizes the risk of overflow and optimizes performance, especially given the constraints of the problem. \n\n    In future implementations, I will consider using similar iterative methods for combinations and powers to enhance efficiency and clarity in my solutions.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The approach involved using dynamic programming to track the number of ways to reach each city at each second.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n1. **Dynamic Programming**: The solution required maintaining a 2D DP table where `dp[time][city]` represents the number of ways to be in `city` at `time`. The base case was initialized with `dp[0][1] = 1`, indicating Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0.\n\n2. **Adjacency List**: An adjacency list was created to represent the roads between cities, allowing for efficient traversal of connected cities.\n\n3. **Path Counting**: The DP table was updated to account for both staying in the same city and moving to adjacent cities. This was a crucial step that needed careful implementation to ensure all paths were counted correctly.\n\n### Issues Encountered:\n- The initial implementations failed to correctly propagate the number of ways to reach each city, particularly in how the DP table was updated. The logic for moving to neighbors was not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect results.\n- The conditions checking at the end of the computation were also not yielding the expected results due to the incorrect state of the DP table.\n\n### Lessons Learned:\n- It is essential to ensure that all possible transitions (staying and moving) are accurately reflected in the DP updates.\n- Testing edge cases and ensuring that the DP table is filled correctly is crucial for the final output to be accurate.\n- The importance of modular arithmetic in preventing overflow issues when dealing with large numbers in combinatorial problems.\n\n### Final Code Snippet:\n```python\ndef count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]\n    dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]\n    for u, v in roads:\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    for time in range(1, K + 1):\n        for city in range(1, N + 1):\n            dp[time][city] = dp[time - 1][city]  # Stay in the same city\n            for neighbor in adj[city]:\n                dp[time][city] = (dp[time][city] + dp[time - 1][neighbor]) % MOD  # Move to neighbor\n\n    valid_paths = 1\n    for a_i, b_i in conditions:\n        valid_paths = (valid_paths * dp[b_i][a_i]) % MOD\n\n    return valid_paths\n```\n\nThis summary encapsulates the core concepts, strategies, and lessons learned from the problem-solving process, which can be useful for future reference in similar dynamic programming challenges."
