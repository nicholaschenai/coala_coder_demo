## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Nadaca is a country with N$N$ cities. These cities are numbered 1$1$ through N$N$ and connected by M$M$ bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.
Initially, Ryan is in city 1$1$. At each of the following K$K$ seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has Q$Q$ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),â€¦,(aQ,bQ)$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots, (a_Q, b_Q)$ meaning that during this K$K$-second trip, for each valid i$i$, he wants to be in city ai$a_i$ after exactly bi$b_i$ seconds.
Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,â€¦,K$1, 2, \ldots, K$ seconds.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N$N$, M$M$ and K$K$.
- Each of the next M$M$ lines contains two space-separated integers u$u$ and v$v$ denoting a road between cities u$u$ and v$v$.
- The next line contains a single integer Q$Q$.
- Q$Q$ lines follow. For each i$i$ (1â‰¤iâ‰¤Q$1 \le i \le Q$), the i$i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers ai$a_i$ and bi$b_i$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of trips Ryan can make, modulo 109+7$10^9+7$.

-----Constraints-----

- 1â‰¤ui,viâ‰¤N$1 \le u_i, v_i \le N$ for each valid i$i$
- uiâ‰ vi$u_i \neq v_i$ for each valid i$i$
- there is at most one road between each pair of cities
- each city is reachable from every other city
- 1â‰¤aiâ‰¤N$1 \le a_i \le N$ for each valid i$i$
- 0â‰¤biâ‰¤K$0 \le b_i \le K$ for each valid i$i$

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a number of cities connected by roads, and Ryan starts in city 1. He can move to adjacent cities or stay in the same city over a period of K seconds. There are certain conditions that specify which city Ryan must be in at specific times. The goal is to determine how many different valid paths Ryan can take that satisfy all the conditions.

2. **Conceptualize a solution:**
   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will maintain a 2D array `dp` where `dp[t][c]` represents the number of ways to be in city `c` after `t` seconds. We will initialize `dp[0][1]` to 1 since Ryan starts in city 1. For each second from 1 to K, we will update the `dp` array based on the possible movements from the previous second. After processing all seconds, we will check the conditions and count the valid paths that meet them.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_trips(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
       initialize dp array of size (K+1) x (N+1) with zeros
       dp[0][1] = 1  // Ryan starts in city 1
       
       // Build adjacency list from roads
       adjacency_list = create adjacency list from roads
       
       // Fill dp array
       for t from 1 to K:
           for each city c from 1 to N:
               for each neighbor in adjacency_list[c]:
                   dp[t][neighbor] += dp[t-1][c]
                   dp[t][neighbor] %= MOD
               dp[t][c] += dp[t-1][c]  // staying in the same city
               dp[t][c] %= MOD
       
       // Check conditions
       valid_paths = 1
       for each condition (a_i, b_i) in conditions:
           valid_paths *= dp[b_i][a_i]
           valid_paths %= MOD
       
       return valid_paths
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 solution:**
```python
def count_trips(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # Initialize dp array
    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]
    dp[0][1] = 1  # Ryan starts in city 1
    
    # Build adjacency list from roads
    adjacency_list = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for u, v in roads:
        adjacency_list[u].append(v)
        adjacency_list[v].append(u)
    
    # Fill dp array
    for t in range(1, K + 1):
        for c in range(1, N + 1):
            for neighbor in adjacency_list[c]:
                dp[t][neighbor] += dp[t - 1][c]
                dp[t][neighbor] %= MOD
            dp[t][c] += dp[t - 1][c]  # staying in the same city
            dp[t][c] %= MOD
    
    # Check conditions
    valid_paths = 1
    for a_i, b_i in conditions:
        valid_paths *= dp[b_i][a_i]
        valid_paths %= MOD
    
    return valid_paths

# Read input and process each test case
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    N, M, K = map(int, input().split())
    roads = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(M)]
    Q = int(input())
    conditions = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(Q)]
    
    result = count_trips(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Nadaca is a country with N$N$ cities. These cities are numbered 1$1$ through N$N$ and connected by M$M$ bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.
Initially, Ryan is in city 1$1$. At each of the following K$K$ seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has Q$Q$ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),â€¦,(aQ,bQ)$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots, (a_Q, b_Q)$ meaning that during this K$K$-second trip, for each valid i$i$, he wants to be in city ai$a_i$ after exactly bi$b_i$ seconds.
Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,â€¦,K$1, 2, \ldots, K$ seconds.

        total subsets are:

        {3}

        {1,2}

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

    [Previous Critique]:
        None
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
           The task is to determine how many subsets can be formed from the numbers 1 to N such that a specific number I appears in the K-th position of the subset when sorted. The output should be the count of such subsets for multiple queries, and since the result can be large, it should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
           To solve this problem, we need to:
           - Understand that for a number I to be in the K-th position of a subset, there must be exactly \(K-1\) numbers less than I in the subset.
           - The remaining numbers in the subset can be chosen from the numbers greater than I.
           - We can use combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of ways to choose \(K-1\) numbers from the \(I-1\) numbers less than I and any number of numbers from the \(N-I\) numbers greater than I.
           - The total number of valid subsets can be calculated using combinations and powers of 2.

        3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
           ```
           function calculate_combinations(n, k):
               if k > n or k < 0:
                   return 0
               return factorial(n) / (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))

           function count_subsets(N, I, K):
               if K > I or K < 1:
                   return 0
               count_less_than_I = calculate_combinations(I - 1, K - 1)
               count_greater_than_I = 2^(N - I)
               return (count_less_than_I * count_greater_than_I) % (10^9 + 7)

           function main():
               read T
               for each test case:
                   read N, Q
                   for each query:
                       read I, K
                       result = count_subsets(N, I, K)
                       print(result)
           ```

        4. **Final Python Code**:
        ```python
        def factorial(n):
            if n == 0 or n == 1:
                return 1

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money (K) to N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money, such that he ends up with exactly zero. The key insights were that if the total demand from all minions exceeds K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and if the total demand equals K, he can distribute the money exactly.

    Initially, I implemented a solution that simply checked if the total demand was greater than, equal to, or less than K. However, this approach failed to account for the scenario where the total demand was less than K but could still be distributed in a way that Gru ends up with zero. The logic needed to ensure that Gru could fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.

    The correct approach involves:
    1. Calculating the total demand.
    2. Checking if the total demand exceeds K (output "NO").
    3. If the total demand equals K, output "YES".
    4. If the total demand is less than K, output "NO" since Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.

    The final code snippet that captures this logic is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, input().split())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
            total_demand = sum(A)
        
            if total_demand > K:
                print("NO")
            elif total_demand == K:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    can_distribute_money(T)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the conditions under which money can be distributed and ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly.

[Reflection]:
    The official solution provides a more efficient and straightforward approach to solving the problem of counting subsets with specific conditions. Here are the key insights and steps distilled from the official solution:

    1. **Understanding the Conditions**: The official solution correctly identifies that if \( K > I \), the count of valid subsets is zero since there cannot be \( K \) elements in a subset if \( I \) is the \( K \)-th element.

    2. **Efficient Calculation of Combinations**: Instead of using factorials directly, the official solution calculates combinations using a loop to avoid large intermediate values. This is done by iteratively multiplying and dividing to compute \( C(I-1, K-1) \) without explicitly calculating factorials, which can be computationally expensive.

    3. **Power of Two for Remaining Elements**: The solution efficiently calculates the number of ways to choose any subset from the remaining elements greater than \( I \) using \( 2^{(N-I)} \). This is a direct application of the power set concept.

    4. **Modular Arithmetic**: The final result is computed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers, ensuring that the solution remains within the bounds of typical integer operations in programming.

    5. **Iterative Approach**: The solution processes each query in a loop, maintaining clarity and efficiency. It avoids unnecessary function calls and keeps the logic straightforward.

    Overall, the official solution is effective due to its use of iterative calculations for combinations, direct handling of edge cases, and efficient power calculations. This approach minimizes the risk of overflow and optimizes performance, especially given the constraints of the problem. 

    In future implementations, I will consider using similar iterative methods for combinations and powers to enhance efficiency and clarity in my solutions.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [generation text] 1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
   The problem involves determining how many different paths Ryan can take through a network of cities connected by roads, given specific conditions about where he must be at certain times. Ryan starts in city 1 and can move to adjacent cities or stay in his current city. We need to count the number of valid paths that satisfy all given conditions after a specified number of seconds.

2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways Ryan can be in each city at each second. We will maintain a 2D array where the rows represent the time (from 0 to K) and the columns represent the cities (from 1 to N). For each second, we will update the number of ways to reach each city based on the number of ways to reach adjacent cities in the previous second. After processing all seconds, we will check the conditions to ensure Ryan is in the required cities at the specified times and count the valid paths.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Nadaca is a country with N$N$ cities. These cities are numbered 1$1$ through N$N$ and connected by M$M$ bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.
Initially, Ryan is in city 1$1$. At each of the following K$K$ seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has Q$Q$ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),â€¦,(aQ,bQ)$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots, (a_Q, b_Q)$ meaning that during this K$K$-second trip, for each valid i$i$, he wants to be in city ai$a_i$ after exactly bi$b_i$ seconds.
Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,â€¦,K$1, 2, \ldots, K$ seconds.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N$N$, M$M$ and K$K$.
- Each of the next M$M$ lines contains two space-separated integers u$u$ and v$v$ denoting a road between cities u$u$ and v$v$.
- The next line contains a single integer Q$Q$.
- Q$Q$ lines follow. For each i$i$ (1â‰¤iâ‰¤Q$1 \le i \le Q$), the i$i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers ai$a_i$ and bi$b_i$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of trips Ryan can make, modulo 109+7$10^9+7$.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [generation text] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues that caused it to fail the tests.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Ryan can move between cities connected by roads or stay in the same city.
   - We need to count the number of valid paths Ryan can take over K seconds while satisfying specific conditions about where he must be at certain times.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - The `dp` table is initialized correctly, where `dp[time][city]` represents the number of ways to be in `city` at `time`.
   - The base case `dp[0][1] = 1` is also correct, indicating that Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - The nested loops for filling the `dp` table are not correctly implemented. The logic for updating the number of ways to reach each city based on its neighbors is flawed. Specifically, the code does not correctly account for the fact that Ryan can also stay in the same city.
   - The adjacency list is created correctly, but the way we update the `dp` values does not consider the staying option.

4. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The logic for checking the conditions is correct, but if the `dp` table is not filled correctly, the results will be incorrect.

5. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The main mistake is in the way the `dp` table is updated. We need to ensure that for each city, we consider both moving to adjacent cities and staying in the same city.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Update the DP Table**:
   - For each city, we need to add the number of ways to stay in the same city from the previous time step.
   - We also need to ensure that we are correctly iterating through all cities and their neighbors.

2. **Revised Pseudocode**:
   ```
   function count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
       initialize dp array of size (K+1) x (N+1) with all zeros
       dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

       for time from 1 to K:
           for each city from 1 to N:
               dp[time][city] += dp[time-1][city]  # Stay in the same city
               for each neighbor in adj[city]:
                   dp[time][neighbor] += dp[time-1][city]  # Move to neighbor
                   dp[time][neighbor] %= MOD  # Ensure we take modulo

       # Check conditions
       valid_paths = 1
       for each condition (a_i, b_i):
           valid_paths *= dp[b_i][a_i]
           valid_paths %= MOD

       return valid_paths
   ```

3. **Final Python Code**:
```python
def count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    # Initialize the dp array
    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]
    dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

    # Create adjacency list for roads
    adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for u, v in roads:
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)

    # Fill the dp array
    for time in range(1, K + 1):
        for city in range(1, N + 1):
            dp[time][city] = dp[time - 1][city]  # Stay in the same city
            for neighbor in adj[city]:
                dp[time][neighbor] = (dp[time][neighbor] + dp[time - 1][city]) % MOD

    # Check conditions
    valid_paths = 1
    for a_i, b_i in conditions:
        valid_paths = (valid_paths * dp[b_i][a_i]) % MOD

    return valid_paths

def main():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N, M, K = map(int, input().split())
        roads = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(M)]
        Q = int(input())
        conditions = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(Q)]
        result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)
        print(result)

main()
```

### Summary of Changes:
- The `dp` table is now updated to include the option of staying in the same city.
- The modulo operation is applied correctly to prevent overflow.
- The overall structure remains the same, but the logic for filling the `dp` table is corrected. 

This should resolve the issues and allow the code to pass all tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Nadaca is a country with N$N$ cities. These cities are numbered 1$1$ through N$N$ and connected by M$M$ bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.
Initially, Ryan is in city 1$1$. At each of the following K$K$ seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has Q$Q$ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),â€¦,(aQ,bQ)$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots, (a_Q, b_Q)$ meaning that during this K$K$-second trip, for each valid i$i$, he wants to be in city ai$a_i$ after exactly bi$b_i$ seconds.
Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,â€¦,K$1, 2, \ldots, K$ seconds.

- Each of the next M$M$ lines contains two space-separated integers u$u$ and v$v$ denoting a road between cities u$u$ and v$v$.
- The next line contains a single integer Q$Q$.
- Q$Q$ lines follow. For each i$i$ (1â‰¤iâ‰¤Q$1 \le i \le Q$), the i$i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers ai$a_i$ and bi$b_i$.

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] 1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
   The problem involves determining how many different paths Ryan can take through a network of cities connected by roads, given specific conditions about where he must be at certain times. Ryan starts in city 1 and can move to adjacent cities or stay in his current city. We need to count the number of valid paths that satisfy all given conditions after a specified number of seconds.

2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways Ryan can be in each city at each second. We will maintain a 2D array where the rows represent the time (from 0 to K) and the columns represent the cities (from 1 to N). For each second, we will update the number of ways to reach each city based on the number of ways to reach adjacent cities in the previous second. After processing all seconds, we will check the conditions to ensure Ryan is in the required cities at the specified times and count the valid paths.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):

### Summary of Changes:
- The `dp` table is now updated to include the option of staying in the same city.
- The modulo operation is applied correctly to prevent overflow.
- The overall structure remains the same, but the logic for filling the `dp` table is corrected. 

This should resolve the issues and allow the code to pass all tests.

    [Task]:
        Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
        number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
        The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


        -----Input:-----
        - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
        - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
        - Next Q line contains two number I and K.

        -----Output:-----
        For each test case print required answer.

        -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=1000000
        Subtask 3: 5 points
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=16
        - 1<=Q<=1000
        Subtask 1: 25 points
        - T=1
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=100000
        Subtask 2: 70 points
        - Original Constraints.

        -----Example:-----
        Input:

        1

        3 3

        1 2

        2 1

        3 2

        Output:

        0

        2

        2

        -----Explanation:-----
        For N=3

        total subsets are:

        {1}

        {2}

        {3}

        {1,2}

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
           The task is to determine how many subsets can be formed from the numbers 1 to N such that a specific number I appears in the K-th position of the subset when sorted. The output should be the count of such subsets for multiple queries, and since the result can be large, it should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
           To solve this problem, we need to:
           - Understand that for a number I to be in the K-th position of a subset, there must be exactly \(K-1\) numbers less than I in the subset.
           - The remaining numbers in the subset can be chosen from the numbers greater than I.
           - We can use combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of ways to choose \(K-1\) numbers from the \(I-1\) numbers less than I and any number of numbers from the \(N-I\) numbers greater than I.
           - The total number of valid subsets can be calculated using combinations and powers of 2.

        3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
           ```
           function calculate_combinations(n, k):
               if k > n or k < 0:
                   return 0
               return factorial(n) / (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))

           function count_subsets(N, I, K):
               if K > I or K < 1:
                   return 0
               count_less_than_I = calculate_combinations(I - 1, K - 1)
               count_greater_than_I = 2^(N - I)
               return (count_less_than_I * count_greater_than_I) % (10^9 + 7)

           function main():
               read T
               for each test case:
                   read N, Q
                   for each query:
                       read I, K
                       result = count_subsets(N, I, K)
                       print(result)
           ```

        4. **Final Python Code**:
        ```python
        def factorial(n):
            if n == 0 or n == 1:
                return 1
            result = 1
            for i in range(2, n + 1):
                result = (result * i) % (10**9 + 7)
            return result

        def calculate_combinations(n, k):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return (factorial(n) * pow(factorial(k), -1, 10**9 + 7) * pow(factorial(n - k), -1, 10**9 + 7)) % (10**9 + 7)

        def count_subsets(N, I, K):
            if K > I or K < 1:
                return 0
            count_less_than_I = calculate_combinations(I - 1, K - 1)
            count_greater_than_I = pow(2, N - I, 10**9 + 7)
            return (count_less_than_I * count_greater_than_I) % (10**9 + 7)

        def main():
            MOD = 10**9 + 7
            T = int(input())
            for _ in range(T):
                N, Q = map(int, input().split())
                for __ in range(Q):
                    I, K = map(int, input().split())
                    result = count_subsets(N, I, K)
                    print(result)

        main()
        ``` 

        This code reads the number of test cases and queries, processes each query to calculate the number of valid subsets, and prints the results. The use of modular arithmetic ensures that we handle large numbers appropriately.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money (K) to N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money, such that he ends up with exactly zero. The key insights were that if the total demand from all minions exceeds K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and if the total demand equals K, he can distribute the money exactly.

    Initially, I implemented a solution that simply checked if the total demand was greater than, equal to, or less than K. However, this approach failed to account for the scenario where the total demand was less than K but could still be distributed in a way that Gru ends up with zero. The logic needed to ensure that Gru could fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.

    The correct approach involves:
    1. Calculating the total demand.
    2. Checking if the total demand exceeds K (output "NO").
    3. If the total demand equals K, output "YES".
    4. If the total demand is less than K, output "NO" since Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.

    The final code snippet that captures this logic is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, input().split())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
            total_demand = sum(A)
        
            if total_demand > K:
                print("NO")
            elif total_demand == K:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    can_distribute_money(T)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the conditions under which money can be distributed and ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly.

[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of finding a permutation \( P \) such that \( f(P) = K \), I learned several key concepts and strategies. The function \( f(P) \) is defined as the sum of the maximums of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \( f(P) \) for a descending permutation is \( N \times (N - 1) \). This insight was crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a given \( K \).

    Initially, my approach to calculating the maximum value and adjusting the permutation was flawed. I incorrectly calculated the maximum possible value and did not implement a clear strategy for adjusting the permutation to reach \( K \). The adjustment logic involved swapping adjacent elements, but it lacked a systematic approach to ensure that the desired \( K \) could be achieved.

    After revising the code, I implemented a more structured approach: I calculated the maximum value correctly, checked if \( K \) was feasible, and then constructed a descending permutation. I iteratively adjusted the permutation by swapping elements while recalculating \( f(P) \) until it matched \( K \) or determined it was impossible.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def find_permutation(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, input().split())
            max_value = N * (N - 1)
        
            if K > max_value:
                print(-1)
                continue
        
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_f = sum(max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1]) for i in range(N - 1))
        
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_f > K:
                    if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:
                        permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                        current_f = sum(max(permutation[j], permutation[j + 1]) for j in range(N - 1))
            
                if current_f == K:
                    break
        
            if current_f == K:
                print(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
            else:
                print(-1)

    T = int(input())
    find_permutation(T)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of clearly understanding the problem constraints and systematically approaching adjustments in permutations.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Nadaca is a country with N$N$ cities. These cities are numbered 1$1$ through N$N$ and connected by M$M$ bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.
Initially, Ryan is in city 1$1$. At each of the following K$K$ seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has Q$Q$ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),â€¦,(aQ,bQ)$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots, (a_Q, b_Q)$ meaning that during this K$K$-second trip, for each valid i$i$, he wants to be in city ai$a_i$ after exactly bi$b_i$ seconds.
Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,â€¦,K$1, 2, \ldots, K$ seconds.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] 1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
   The problem involves determining how many different paths Ryan can take through a network of cities connected by roads, given specific conditions about where he must be at certain times. Ryan starts in city 1 and can move to adjacent cities or stay in his current city. We need to count the number of valid paths that satisfy all given conditions after a specified number of seconds.

2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways Ryan can be in each city at each second. We will maintain a 2D array where the rows represent the time (from 0 to K) and the columns represent the cities (from 1 to N). For each second, we will update the number of ways to reach each city based on the number of ways to reach adjacent cities in the previous second. After processing all seconds, we will check the conditions to ensure Ryan is in the required cities at the specified times and count the valid paths.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
       initialize dp array of size (K+1) x (N+1) with all zeros
       dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

       for time from 1 to K:
           for each city from 1 to N:
               for each road (u, v):
                   if city is u:
                       dp[time][v] += dp[time-1][u]
                   if city is v:
                       dp[time][u] += dp[time-1][v]

       # Check conditions
       valid_paths = 1
       for each condition (a_i, b_i):
           valid_paths *= dp[b_i][a_i]
           valid_paths %= (10^9 + 7)

       return valid_paths

   function main():
       read T
       for each test case:
           read N, M, K
           read roads
           read Q
           read conditions
           result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)
           print(result)
   ```

4. **Final Python Code**:
```python
def count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    # Initialize the dp array

    dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

    # Create adjacency list for roads
    adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for u, v in roads:
        adj[u].append(v)

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues that caused it to fail the tests.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Ryan can move between cities connected by roads or stay in the same city.
   - We need to count the number of valid paths Ryan can take over K seconds while satisfying specific conditions about where he must be at certain times.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - The `dp` table is initialized correctly, where `dp[time][city]` represents the number of ways to be in `city` at `time`.
   - The base case `dp[0][1] = 1` is also correct, indicating that Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - The nested loops for filling the `dp` table are not correctly implemented. The logic for updating the number of ways to reach each city based on its neighbors is flawed. Specifically, the code does not correctly account for the fact that Ryan can also stay in the same city.
   - The adjacency list is created correctly, but the way we update the `dp` values does not consider the staying option.

4. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The logic for checking the conditions is correct, but if the `dp` table is not filled correctly, the results will be incorrect.

5. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The main mistake is in the way the `dp` table is updated. We need to ensure that for each city, we consider both moving to adjacent cities and staying in the same city.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Update the DP Table**:
   - For each city, we need to add the number of ways to stay in the same city from the previous time step.
   - We also need to ensure that we are correctly iterating through all cities and their neighbors.

2. **Revised Pseudocode**:
   ```
   function count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
       initialize dp array of size (K+1) x (N+1) with all zeros
       dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

       for time from 1 to K:
           for each city from 1 to N:
               dp[time][city] += dp[time-1][city]  # Stay in the same city
               for each neighbor in adj[city]:
                   dp[time][neighbor] += dp[time-1][city]  # Move to neighbor
                   dp[time][neighbor] %= MOD  # Ensure we take modulo

       # Check conditions
       valid_paths = 1
       for each condition (a_i, b_i):
           valid_paths *= dp[b_i][a_i]
           valid_paths %= MOD

       return valid_paths
   ```

3. **Final Python Code**:
```python
def count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    # Initialize the dp array
    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]
    dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

    # Create adjacency list for roads
    adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for u, v in roads:
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)

    # Fill the dp array
    for time in range(1, K + 1):
        for city in range(1, N + 1):
            dp[time][city] = dp[time - 1][city]  # Stay in the same city
            for neighbor in adj[city]:
                dp[time][neighbor] = (dp[time][neighbor] + dp[time - 1][city]) % MOD

    # Check conditions
    valid_paths = 1
    for a_i, b_i in conditions:
        valid_paths = (valid_paths * dp[b_i][a_i]) % MOD

    return valid_paths

def main():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N, M, K = map(int, input().split())
        roads = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(M)]
        Q = int(input())
        conditions = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(Q)]
        result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)
        print(result)

main()
```

### Summary of Changes:
- The `dp` table is now updated to include the option of staying in the same city.
- The modulo operation is applied correctly to prevent overflow.
- The overall structure remains the same, but the logic for filling the `dp` table is corrected. 

This should resolve the issues and allow the code to pass all tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Nadaca is a country with N$N$ cities. These cities are numbered 1$1$ through N$N$ and connected by M$M$ bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.
Initially, Ryan is in city 1$1$. At each of the following K$K$ seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has Q$Q$ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),â€¦,(aQ,bQ)$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots, (a_Q, b_Q)$ meaning that during this K$K$-second trip, for each valid i$i$, he wants to be in city ai$a_i$ after exactly bi$b_i$ seconds.
Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,â€¦,K$1, 2, \ldots, K$ seconds.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N$N$, M$M$ and K$K$.
- Each of the next M$M$ lines contains two space-separated integers u$u$ and v$v$ denoting a road between cities u$u$ and v$v$.
- The next line contains a single integer Q$Q$.
- Q$Q$ lines follow. For each i$i$ (1â‰¤iâ‰¤Q$1 \le i \le Q$), the i$i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers ai$a_i$ and bi$b_i$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the number of trips Ryan can make, modulo 109+7$10^9+7$.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] 1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
   The problem involves determining how many different paths Ryan can take through a network of cities connected by roads, given specific conditions about where he must be at certain times. Ryan starts in city 1 and can move to adjacent cities or stay in his current city. We need to count the number of valid paths that satisfy all given conditions after a specified number of seconds.

2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways Ryan can be in each city at each second. We will maintain a 2D array where the rows represent the time (from 0 to K) and the columns represent the cities (from 1 to N). For each second, we will update the number of ways to reach each city based on the number of ways to reach adjacent cities in the previous second. After processing all seconds, we will check the conditions to ensure Ryan is in the required cities at the specified times and count the valid paths.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
       initialize dp array of size (K+1) x (N+1) with all zeros
       dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

       for time from 1 to K:
           for each city from 1 to N:
               for each road (u, v):
                   if city is u:
                       dp[time][v] += dp[time-1][u]
                   if city is v:
                       dp[time][u] += dp[time-1][v]

       # Check conditions
       valid_paths = 1
       for each condition (a_i, b_i):
           valid_paths *= dp[b_i][a_i]
           valid_paths %= (10^9 + 7)

       return valid_paths

   function main():
       read T
       for each test case:
           read N, M, K
           read roads
           read Q
           read conditions
           result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)
           print(result)
   ```

4. **Final Python Code**:
```python
def count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    # Initialize the dp array
    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]
    dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

    # Create adjacency list for roads
    adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for u, v in roads:
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)

    # Check conditions

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues that caused it to fail the tests.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Ryan can move between cities connected by roads or stay in the same city.
   - We need to count the number of valid paths Ryan can take over K seconds while satisfying specific conditions about where he must be at certain times.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - The `dp` table is initialized correctly, where `dp[time][city]` represents the number of ways to be in `city` at `time`.
   - The base case `dp[0][1] = 1` is also correct, indicating that Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - The nested loops for filling the `dp` table are not correctly implemented. The logic for updating the number of ways to reach each city based on its neighbors is flawed. Specifically, the code does not correctly account for the fact that Ryan can also stay in the same city.
   - The adjacency list is created correctly, but the way we update the `dp` values does not consider the staying option.

4. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The logic for checking the conditions is correct, but if the `dp` table is not filled correctly, the results will be incorrect.

5. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The main mistake is in the way the `dp` table is updated. We need to ensure that for each city, we consider both moving to adjacent cities and staying in the same city.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Update the DP Table**:
   - For each city, we need to add the number of ways to stay in the same city from the previous time step.
   - We also need to ensure that we are correctly iterating through all cities and their neighbors.

2. **Revised Pseudocode**:
   ```
   function count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
       initialize dp array of size (K+1) x (N+1) with all zeros
       dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

       for time from 1 to K:
           for each city from 1 to N:
               dp[time][city] += dp[time-1][city]  # Stay in the same city
               for each neighbor in adj[city]:
                   dp[time][neighbor] += dp[time-1][city]  # Move to neighbor
                   dp[time][neighbor] %= MOD  # Ensure we take modulo

       # Check conditions
       valid_paths = 1
       for each condition (a_i, b_i):
           valid_paths *= dp[b_i][a_i]
           valid_paths %= MOD

       return valid_paths
   ```

3. **Final Python Code**:
```python
def count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    # Initialize the dp array
    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]
    dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

    # Create adjacency list for roads
    adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for u, v in roads:
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)

    # Fill the dp array
    for time in range(1, K + 1):
        for city in range(1, N + 1):
            dp[time][city] = dp[time - 1][city]  # Stay in the same city
            for neighbor in adj[city]:
                dp[time][neighbor] = (dp[time][neighbor] + dp[time - 1][city]) % MOD

    # Check conditions
    valid_paths = 1
    for a_i, b_i in conditions:
        valid_paths = (valid_paths * dp[b_i][a_i]) % MOD

    return valid_paths

def main():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N, M, K = map(int, input().split())
        roads = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(M)]
        Q = int(input())
        conditions = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(Q)]
        result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)
        print(result)

main()
```

### Summary of Changes:
- The `dp` table is now updated to include the option of staying in the same city.
- The modulo operation is applied correctly to prevent overflow.
- The overall structure remains the same, but the logic for filling the `dp` table is corrected. 

This should resolve the issues and allow the code to pass all tests.

        -----Example:-----
        Input:

        1

        3 3

        1 2

        2 1

        3 2

        Output:

        0

        2

        2

        -----Explanation:-----
        For N=3

        total subsets are:

        {1}

        {2}

        {3}

        {1,2}

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
           The task is to determine how many subsets can be formed from the numbers 1 to N such that a specific number I appears in the K-th position of the subset when sorted. The output should be the count of such subsets for multiple queries, and since the result can be large, it should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
           To solve this problem, we need to:
           - Understand that for a number I to be in the K-th position of a subset, there must be exactly \(K-1\) numbers less than I in the subset.
           - The remaining numbers in the subset can be chosen from the numbers greater than I.
           - We can use combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of ways to choose \(K-1\) numbers from the \(I-1\) numbers less than I and any number of numbers from the \(N-I\) numbers greater than I.
           - The total number of valid subsets can be calculated using combinations and powers of 2.

        3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
           ```
           function calculate_combinations(n, k):
               if k > n or k < 0:
                   return 0
               return factorial(n) / (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))

           function count_subsets(N, I, K):
               if K > I or K < 1:
                   return 0
               count_less_than_I = calculate_combinations(I - 1, K - 1)
               count_greater_than_I = 2^(N - I)
               return (count_less_than_I * count_greater_than_I) % (10^9 + 7)

           function main():
               read T
               for each test case:
                   read N, Q
                   for each query:
                       read I, K
                       result = count_subsets(N, I, K)
                       print(result)
           ```

        4. **Final Python Code**:
        ```python
        def factorial(n):
            if n == 0 or n == 1:
                return 1
            result = 1
            for i in range(2, n + 1):
                result = (result * i) % (10**9 + 7)
            return result

        def calculate_combinations(n, k):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return (factorial(n) * pow(factorial(k), -1, 10**9 + 7) * pow(factorial(n - k), -1, 10**9 + 7)) % (10**9 + 7)

        def count_subsets(N, I, K):
            if K > I or K < 1:
                return 0
            count_less_than_I = calculate_combinations(I - 1, K - 1)
            count_greater_than_I = pow(2, N - I, 10**9 + 7)
            return (count_less_than_I * count_greater_than_I) % (10**9 + 7)

        def main():
            MOD = 10**9 + 7
            T = int(input())
            for _ in range(T):
                N, Q = map(int, input().split())
                for __ in range(Q):
                    I, K = map(int, input().split())
                    result = count_subsets(N, I, K)
                    print(result)

        main()
        ``` 

        This code reads the number of test cases and queries, processes each query to calculate the number of valid subsets, and prints the results. The use of modular arithmetic ensures that we handle large numbers appropriately.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money (K) to N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money, such that he ends up with exactly zero. The key insights were that if the total demand from all minions exceeds K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and if the total demand equals K, he can distribute the money exactly.

    Initially, I implemented a solution that simply checked if the total demand was greater than, equal to, or less than K. However, this approach failed to account for the scenario where the total demand was less than K but could still be distributed in a way that Gru ends up with zero. The logic needed to ensure that Gru could fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.

    The correct approach involves:
    1. Calculating the total demand.
    2. Checking if the total demand exceeds K (output "NO").
    3. If the total demand equals K, output "YES".
    4. If the total demand is less than K, output "NO" since Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.

    The final code snippet that captures this logic is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, input().split())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
            total_demand = sum(A)
        
            if total_demand > K:
                print("NO")
            elif total_demand == K:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    can_distribute_money(T)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the conditions under which money can be distributed and ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly.

[Reflection]:
    The official solution provides a more efficient and straightforward approach to solving the problem of counting subsets with specific conditions. Here are the key insights and steps distilled from the official solution:

    1. **Understanding the Conditions**: The official solution correctly identifies that if \( K > I \), the count of valid subsets is zero since there cannot be \( K \) elements in a subset if \( I \) is the \( K \)-th element.

    2. **Efficient Calculation of Combinations**: Instead of using factorials directly, the official solution calculates combinations using a loop to avoid large intermediate values. This is done by iteratively multiplying and dividing to compute \( C(I-1, K-1) \) without explicitly calculating factorials, which can be computationally expensive.

    3. **Power of Two for Remaining Elements**: The solution efficiently calculates the number of ways to choose any subset from the remaining elements greater than \( I \) using \( 2^{(N-I)} \). This is a direct application of the power set concept.

    4. **Modular Arithmetic**: The final result is computed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers, ensuring that the solution remains within the bounds of typical integer operations in programming.

    5. **Iterative Approach**: The solution processes each query in a loop, maintaining clarity and efficiency. It avoids unnecessary function calls and keeps the logic straightforward.

    Overall, the official solution is effective due to its use of iterative calculations for combinations, direct handling of edge cases, and efficient power calculations. This approach minimizes the risk of overflow and optimizes performance, especially given the constraints of the problem. 

    In future implementations, I will consider using similar iterative methods for combinations and powers to enhance efficiency and clarity in my solutions.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [generation text] Based on the previous analysis and insights, I will revise the solution to ensure it correctly counts the number of valid paths Ryan can take while satisfying the given conditions. The key points to address are:

1. **Correctly Update the DP Table**: Ensure that the number of ways to stay in the same city and move to adjacent cities is accurately reflected in the DP table.
2. **Handle Edge Cases**: Ensure that the conditions are checked properly and that the results are computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Here is the corrected Python code:

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Nadaca is a country with N$N$ cities. These cities are numbered 1$1$ through N$N$ and connected by M$M$ bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.
Initially, Ryan is in city 1$1$. At each of the following K$K$ seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has Q$Q$ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),â€¦,(aQ,bQ)$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots, (a_Q, b_Q)$ meaning that during this K$K$-second trip, for each valid i$i$, he wants to be in city ai$a_i$ after exactly bi$b_i$ seconds.
Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,â€¦,K$1, 2, \ldots, K$ seconds.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows.

- Each of the next M$M$ lines contains two space-separated integers u$u$ and v$v$ denoting a road between cities u$u$ and v$v$.
- The next line contains a single integer Q$Q$.
- Q$Q$ lines follow. For each i$i$ (1â‰¤iâ‰¤Q$1 \le i \le Q$), the i$i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers ai$a_i$ and bi$b_i$.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] 1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
   The problem involves determining how many different paths Ryan can take through a network of cities connected by roads, given specific conditions about where he must be at certain times. Ryan starts in city 1 and can move to adjacent cities or stay in his current city. We need to count the number of valid paths that satisfy all given conditions after a specified number of seconds.

2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways Ryan can be in each city at each second. We will maintain a 2D array where the rows represent the time (from 0 to K) and the columns represent the cities (from 1 to N). For each second, we will update the number of ways to reach each city based on the number of ways to reach adjacent cities in the previous second. After processing all seconds, we will check the conditions to ensure Ryan is in the required cities at the specified times and count the valid paths.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:

   function count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
       initialize dp array of size (K+1) x (N+1) with all zeros
       dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

       for time from 1 to K:
           for each city from 1 to N:
               for each road (u, v):
                   if city is u:
                       dp[time][v] += dp[time-1][u]
                   if city is v:
                       dp[time][u] += dp[time-1][v]

       # Check conditions
       valid_paths = 1
       for each condition (a_i, b_i):
           valid_paths *= dp[b_i][a_i]
           valid_paths %= (10^9 + 7)

       return valid_paths

   function main():
       read T
       for each test case:
           read N, M, K
           read roads
           read Q
           read conditions
           result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)
           print(result)
   ```

4. **Final Python Code**:
```python
def count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    # Initialize the dp array
    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]
    dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

    # Create adjacency list for roads
    adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for u, v in roads:
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)

    # Fill the dp array
    for time in range(1, K + 1):
        for city in range(1, N + 1):
            for neighbor in adj[city]:
                dp[time][neighbor] = (dp[time][neighbor] + dp[time - 1][city]) % MOD

    # Check conditions
    valid_paths = 1
    for a_i, b_i in conditions:

        result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)
        print(result)

main()
```

This code initializes a dynamic programming table to track the number of ways to reach each city at each second, updates the table based on the roads, and finally checks the conditions to count the valid paths. The results are printed for each test case.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues that caused it to fail the tests.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Ryan can move between cities connected by roads or stay in the same city.
   - We need to count the number of valid paths Ryan can take over K seconds while satisfying specific conditions about where he must be at certain times.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - The `dp` table is initialized correctly, where `dp[time][city]` represents the number of ways to be in `city` at `time`.
   - The base case `dp[0][1] = 1` is also correct, indicating that Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - The nested loops for filling the `dp` table are not correctly implemented. The logic for updating the number of ways to reach each city based on its neighbors is flawed. Specifically, the code does not correctly account for the fact that Ryan can also stay in the same city.
   - The adjacency list is created correctly, but the way we update the `dp` values does not consider the staying option.

4. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The logic for checking the conditions is correct, but if the `dp` table is not filled correctly, the results will be incorrect.

5. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The main mistake is in the way the `dp` table is updated. We need to ensure that for each city, we consider both moving to adjacent cities and staying in the same city.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Update the DP Table**:
   - For each city, we need to add the number of ways to stay in the same city from the previous time step.
   - We also need to ensure that we are correctly iterating through all cities and their neighbors.

2. **Revised Pseudocode**:
   ```
   function count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
       initialize dp array of size (K+1) x (N+1) with all zeros
       dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

       for time from 1 to K:
           for each city from 1 to N:
               dp[time][city] += dp[time-1][city]  # Stay in the same city
               for each neighbor in adj[city]:
                   dp[time][neighbor] += dp[time-1][city]  # Move to neighbor
                   dp[time][neighbor] %= MOD  # Ensure we take modulo

       # Check conditions
       valid_paths = 1
       for each condition (a_i, b_i):
           valid_paths *= dp[b_i][a_i]
           valid_paths %= MOD

       return valid_paths
   ```

3. **Final Python Code**:
```python
def count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    # Initialize the dp array
    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]
    dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

    # Create adjacency list for roads
    adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for u, v in roads:
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)

    # Fill the dp array
    for time in range(1, K + 1):
        for city in range(1, N + 1):
            dp[time][city] = dp[time - 1][city]  # Stay in the same city
            for neighbor in adj[city]:
                dp[time][neighbor] = (dp[time][neighbor] + dp[time - 1][city]) % MOD

    # Check conditions
    valid_paths = 1
    for a_i, b_i in conditions:
        valid_paths = (valid_paths * dp[b_i][a_i]) % MOD

    return valid_paths

def main():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N, M, K = map(int, input().split())
        roads = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(M)]
        Q = int(input())
        conditions = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(Q)]
        result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)
        print(result)

main()
```

### Summary of Changes:
- The `dp` table is now updated to include the option of staying in the same city.
- The modulo operation is applied correctly to prevent overflow.
- The overall structure remains the same, but the logic for filling the `dp` table is corrected. 

This should resolve the issues and allow the code to pass all tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Nadaca is a country with N$N$ cities. These cities are numbered 1$1$ through N$N$ and connected by M$M$ bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.
Initially, Ryan is in city 1$1$. At each of the following K$K$ seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has Q$Q$ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),â€¦,(aQ,bQ)$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots, (a_Q, b_Q)$ meaning that during this K$K$-second trip, for each valid i$i$, he wants to be in city ai$a_i$ after exactly bi$b_i$ seconds.
Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,â€¦,K$1, 2, \ldots, K$ seconds.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N$N$, M$M$ and K$K$.
- Each of the next M$M$ lines contains two space-separated integers u$u$ and v$v$ denoting a road between cities u$u$ and v$v$.
- The next line contains a single integer Q$Q$.
- Q$Q$ lines follow. For each i$i$ (1â‰¤iâ‰¤Q$1 \le i \le Q$), the i$i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers ai$a_i$ and bi$b_i$.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] 1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
   The problem involves determining how many different paths Ryan can take through a network of cities connected by roads, given specific conditions about where he must be at certain times. Ryan starts in city 1 and can move to adjacent cities or stay in his current city. We need to count the number of valid paths that satisfy all given conditions after a specified number of seconds.

2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways Ryan can be in each city at each second. We will maintain a 2D array where the rows represent the time (from 0 to K) and the columns represent the cities (from 1 to N). For each second, we will update the number of ways to reach each city based on the number of ways to reach adjacent cities in the previous second. After processing all seconds, we will check the conditions to ensure Ryan is in the required cities at the specified times and count the valid paths.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
       initialize dp array of size (K+1) x (N+1) with all zeros
       dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

       for time from 1 to K:
           for each city from 1 to N:
               for each road (u, v):
                   if city is u:
                       dp[time][v] += dp[time-1][u]
                   if city is v:
                       dp[time][u] += dp[time-1][v]

       # Check conditions
       valid_paths = 1
       for each condition (a_i, b_i):
           valid_paths *= dp[b_i][a_i]
           valid_paths %= (10^9 + 7)

       return valid_paths

   function main():
       read T
       for each test case:
           read N, M, K
           read roads
           read Q
           read conditions
           result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)
           print(result)
   ```

4. **Final Python Code**:
```python
def count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    # Initialize the dp array
    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]
    dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

    # Create adjacency list for roads
    adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for u, v in roads:
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)

    # Fill the dp array
    for time in range(1, K + 1):
        for city in range(1, N + 1):
            for neighbor in adj[city]:
                dp[time][neighbor] = (dp[time][neighbor] + dp[time - 1][city]) % MOD

    # Check conditions
    valid_paths = 1
    for a_i, b_i in conditions:
        valid_paths = (valid_paths * dp[b_i][a_i]) % MOD

    return valid_paths

def main():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N, M, K = map(int, input().split())
        roads = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(M)]
        Q = int(input())
        conditions = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(Q)]
        result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)
        print(result)

main()
```

This code initializes a dynamic programming table to track the number of ways to reach each city at each second, updates the table based on the roads, and finally checks the conditions to count the valid paths. The results are printed for each test case.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues that caused it to fail the tests.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Ryan can move between cities connected by roads or stay in the same city.
   - We need to count the number of valid paths Ryan can take over K seconds while satisfying specific conditions about where he must be at certain times.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - The `dp` table is initialized correctly, where `dp[time][city]` represents the number of ways to be in `city` at `time`.
   - The base case `dp[0][1] = 1` is also correct, indicating that Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - The nested loops for filling the `dp` table are not correctly implemented. The logic for updating the number of ways to reach each city based on its neighbors is flawed. Specifically, the code does not correctly account for the fact that Ryan can also stay in the same city.
   - The adjacency list is created correctly, but the way we update the `dp` values does not consider the staying option.

4. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The logic for checking the conditions is correct, but if the `dp` table is not filled correctly, the results will be incorrect.

5. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The main mistake is in the way the `dp` table is updated. We need to ensure that for each city, we consider both moving to adjacent cities and staying in the same city.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Update the DP Table**:
   - For each city, we need to add the number of ways to stay in the same city from the previous time step.
   - We also need to ensure that we are correctly iterating through all cities and their neighbors.

2. **Revised Pseudocode**:
   ```
   function count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
       initialize dp array of size (K+1) x (N+1) with all zeros
       dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

       for time from 1 to K:
           for each city from 1 to N:
               dp[time][city] += dp[time-1][city]  # Stay in the same city
               for each neighbor in adj[city]:
                   dp[time][neighbor] += dp[time-1][city]  # Move to neighbor
                   dp[time][neighbor] %= MOD  # Ensure we take modulo

       # Check conditions
       valid_paths = 1
       for each condition (a_i, b_i):
           valid_paths *= dp[b_i][a_i]
           valid_paths %= MOD

       return valid_paths
   ```

3. **Final Python Code**:
```python
def count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    # Initialize the dp array
    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]
    dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

    # Create adjacency list for roads
    adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for u, v in roads:
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)

    # Fill the dp array
    for time in range(1, K + 1):
        for city in range(1, N + 1):
            dp[time][city] = dp[time - 1][city]  # Stay in the same city
            for neighbor in adj[city]:
                dp[time][neighbor] = (dp[time][neighbor] + dp[time - 1][city]) % MOD

    # Check conditions
    valid_paths = 1
    for a_i, b_i in conditions:
        valid_paths = (valid_paths * dp[b_i][a_i]) % MOD

    return valid_paths

def main():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N, M, K = map(int, input().split())
        roads = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(M)]
        Q = int(input())

        result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)
        print(result)

main()
```

### Summary of Changes:
- The `dp` table is now updated to include the option of staying in the same city.
- The modulo operation is applied correctly to prevent overflow.
- The overall structure remains the same, but the logic for filling the `dp` table is corrected. 

This should resolve the issues and allow the code to pass all tests.

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Staying in the Same City**: The `dp` table now correctly accounts for the option of Ryan staying in the same city at each time step.
2. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is applied consistently to ensure that we do not encounter overflow issues.
3. **Input Handling**: The input handling remains the same, ensuring that we read the number of test cases, cities, roads, and conditions correctly.

This code should now correctly compute the number of valid paths Ryan can take while satisfying the given conditions.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues that caused it to fail the tests again.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Ryan can move between cities connected by roads or stay in the same city.
   - We need to count the number of valid paths Ryan can take over K seconds while satisfying specific conditions about where he must be at certain times.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - The `dp` table is initialized correctly, where `dp[time][city]` represents the number of ways to be in `city` at `time`.
   - The base case `dp[0][1] = 1` is also correct, indicating that Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - The logic for filling the `dp` table is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly propagate the number of ways to reach each city from its neighbors. Specifically, the way we are updating the `dp` values does not ensure that all paths are counted correctly.
   - The update for staying in the same city is correct, but the update for moving to adjacent cities needs to be revised.

4. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The logic for checking the conditions is correct, but if the `dp` table is not filled correctly, the results will be incorrect.

5. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The main mistake is in the way the `dp` table is updated. We need to ensure that for each city, we consider both moving to adjacent cities and staying in the same city correctly.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Update the DP Table**:
   - For each city, we need to add the number of ways to stay in the same city from the previous time step.
   - We also need to ensure that we are correctly iterating through all cities and their neighbors.

2. **Revised Pseudocode**:
   ```
   function count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
       initialize dp array of size (K+1) x (N+1) with all zeros
       dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

       for time from 1 to K:
           for each city from 1 to N:
               dp[time][city] += dp[time-1][city]  # Stay in the same city
               for each neighbor in adj[city]:
                   dp[time][neighbor] += dp[time-1][city]  # Move to neighbor
                   dp[time][neighbor] %= MOD  # Ensure we take modulo

       # Check conditions
       valid_paths = 1
       for each condition (a_i, b_i):
           valid_paths *= dp[b_i][a_i]
           valid_paths %= MOD

       return valid_paths
   ```

3. **Final Python Code**:

def count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7

    [Task]:
        Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
        number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
        The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


        -----Input:-----
        - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
        - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
        - Next Q line contains two number I and K.

        -----Output:-----
        For each test case print required answer.

        -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=1000000
        Subtask 3: 5 points
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=16
        - 1<=Q<=1000
        Subtask 1: 25 points
        - T=1
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=100000
        Subtask 2: 70 points
        - Original Constraints.

        -----Example:-----
        Input:

        1

        3 3

        1 2

        2 1

        3 2

        Output:

        0

        2

        2

        -----Explanation:-----
        For N=3

        total subsets are:

        {1}

        {2}

        {3}

        {1,2}

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
           The task is to determine how many subsets can be formed from the numbers 1 to N such that a specific number I appears in the K-th position of the subset when sorted. The output should be the count of such subsets for multiple queries, and since the result can be large, it should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
           To solve this problem, we need to:
           - Understand that for a number I to be in the K-th position of a subset, there must be exactly \(K-1\) numbers less than I in the subset.
           - The remaining numbers in the subset can be chosen from the numbers greater than I.
           - We can use combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of ways to choose \(K-1\) numbers from the \(I-1\) numbers less than I and any number of numbers from the \(N-I\) numbers greater than I.
           - The total number of valid subsets can be calculated using combinations and powers of 2.

        3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
           ```
           function calculate_combinations(n, k):
               if k > n or k < 0:
                   return 0
               return factorial(n) / (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))

           function count_subsets(N, I, K):
               if K > I or K < 1:
                   return 0
               count_less_than_I = calculate_combinations(I - 1, K - 1)
               count_greater_than_I = 2^(N - I)
               return (count_less_than_I * count_greater_than_I) % (10^9 + 7)

           function main():
               read T
               for each test case:
                   read N, Q
                   for each query:
                       read I, K
                       result = count_subsets(N, I, K)
                       print(result)
           ```

            if n == 0 or n == 1:

            result = 1
            for i in range(2, n + 1):
                result = (result * i) % (10**9 + 7)
            return result

        def calculate_combinations(n, k):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return (factorial(n) * pow(factorial(k), -1, 10**9 + 7) * pow(factorial(n - k), -1, 10**9 + 7)) % (10**9 + 7)

        def count_subsets(N, I, K):
            if K > I or K < 1:
                return 0
            count_less_than_I = calculate_combinations(I - 1, K - 1)
            count_greater_than_I = pow(2, N - I, 10**9 + 7)
            return (count_less_than_I * count_greater_than_I) % (10**9 + 7)

        def main():

                    result = count_subsets(N, I, K)
                    print(result)

        main()
        ``` 

        This code reads the number of test cases and queries, processes each query to calculate the number of valid subsets, and prints the results. The use of modular arithmetic ensures that we handle large numbers appropriately.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money (K) to N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money, such that he ends up with exactly zero. The key insights were that if the total demand from all minions exceeds K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and if the total demand equals K, he can distribute the money exactly.

    Initially, I implemented a solution that simply checked if the total demand was greater than, equal to, or less than K. However, this approach failed to account for the scenario where the total demand was less than K but could still be distributed in a way that Gru ends up with zero. The logic needed to ensure that Gru could fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.

    The correct approach involves:
    1. Calculating the total demand.
    2. Checking if the total demand exceeds K (output "NO").
    3. If the total demand equals K, output "YES".
    4. If the total demand is less than K, output "NO" since Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.

    The final code snippet that captures this logic is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, input().split())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
            total_demand = sum(A)
        
            if total_demand > K:
                print("NO")
            elif total_demand == K:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    can_distribute_money(T)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the conditions under which money can be distributed and ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly.

[Reflection]:
    The official solution provides a more efficient and straightforward approach to solving the problem of counting subsets with specific conditions. Here are the key insights and steps distilled from the official solution:

    1. **Understanding the Conditions**: The official solution correctly identifies that if \( K > I \), the count of valid subsets is zero since there cannot be \( K \) elements in a subset if \( I \) is the \( K \)-th element.

    2. **Efficient Calculation of Combinations**: Instead of using factorials directly, the official solution calculates combinations using a loop to avoid large intermediate values. This is done by iteratively multiplying and dividing to compute \( C(I-1, K-1) \) without explicitly calculating factorials, which can be computationally expensive.

    3. **Power of Two for Remaining Elements**: The solution efficiently calculates the number of ways to choose any subset from the remaining elements greater than \( I \) using \( 2^{(N-I)} \). This is a direct application of the power set concept.

    4. **Modular Arithmetic**: The final result is computed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers, ensuring that the solution remains within the bounds of typical integer operations in programming.

    5. **Iterative Approach**: The solution processes each query in a loop, maintaining clarity and efficiency. It avoids unnecessary function calls and keeps the logic straightforward.

    Overall, the official solution is effective due to its use of iterative calculations for combinations, direct handling of edge cases, and efficient power calculations. This approach minimizes the risk of overflow and optimizes performance, especially given the constraints of the problem. 

    In future implementations, I will consider using similar iterative methods for combinations and powers to enhance efficiency and clarity in my solutions.

 Based on the previous analysis and the insights gained, I will revise the solution to ensure it correctly counts the number of valid paths Ryan can take while satisfying the given conditions. The key points to address are:

1. **Correctly Update the DP Table**: Ensure that the number of ways to stay in the same city and move to adjacent cities is accurately reflected in the DP table.
2. **Handle Edge Cases**: Ensure that the conditions are checked properly and that the results are computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    # Initialize the dp array
    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]
    dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

    # Create adjacency list for roads
    adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for u, v in roads:
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)

    # Fill the dp array
    for time in range(1, K + 1):
        for city in range(1, N + 1):
            dp[time][city] = dp[time - 1][city]  # Stay in the same city
            for neighbor in adj[city]:
                dp[time][city] = (dp[time][city] + dp[time - 1][neighbor]) % MOD  # Move to neighbor

    # Check conditions
    valid_paths = 1
    for a_i, b_i in conditions:
        valid_paths = (valid_paths * dp[b_i][a_i]) % MOD

    return valid_paths

def main():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N, M, K = map(int, input().split())
        roads = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(M)]
        Q = int(input())
        conditions = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(Q)]
        result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)
        print(result)

main()
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Staying in the Same City**: The `dp` table now correctly accounts for the option of Ryan staying in the same city at each time step.
2. **Correct Neighbor Updates**: The update for moving to neighbors is now correctly implemented, ensuring that all paths are counted.
3. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is applied consistently to prevent overflow issues.

This code should now correctly compute the number of valid paths Ryan can take while satisfying the given conditions.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Nadaca is a country with N$N$ cities. These cities are numbered 1$1$ through N$N$ and connected by M$M$ bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.
Initially, Ryan is in city 1$1$. At each of the following K$K$ seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has Q$Q$ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),â€¦,(aQ,bQ)$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots, (a_Q, b_Q)$ meaning that during this K$K$-second trip, for each valid i$i$, he wants to be in city ai$a_i$ after exactly bi$b_i$ seconds.
Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,â€¦,K$1, 2, \ldots, K$ seconds.

-----Input-----

- Each of the next M$M$ lines contains two space-separated integers u$u$ and v$v$ denoting a road between cities u$u$ and v$v$.
- The next line contains a single integer Q$Q$.
- Q$Q$ lines follow. For each i$i$ (1â‰¤iâ‰¤Q$1 \le i \le Q$), the i$i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers ai$a_i$ and bi$b_i$.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] 1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
   The problem involves determining how many different paths Ryan can take through a network of cities connected by roads, given specific conditions about where he must be at certain times. Ryan starts in city 1 and can move to adjacent cities or stay in his current city. We need to count the number of valid paths that satisfy all given conditions after a specified number of seconds.

2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways Ryan can be in each city at each second. We will maintain a 2D array where the rows represent the time (from 0 to K) and the columns represent the cities (from 1 to N). For each second, we will update the number of ways to reach each city based on the number of ways to reach adjacent cities in the previous second. After processing all seconds, we will check the conditions to ensure Ryan is in the required cities at the specified times and count the valid paths.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
       initialize dp array of size (K+1) x (N+1) with all zeros
       dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

       for time from 1 to K:
           for each city from 1 to N:
               for each road (u, v):
                   if city is u:
                       dp[time][v] += dp[time-1][u]
                   if city is v:
                       dp[time][u] += dp[time-1][v]

       # Check conditions
       valid_paths = 1
       for each condition (a_i, b_i):
           valid_paths *= dp[b_i][a_i]
           valid_paths %= (10^9 + 7)

       return valid_paths

   function main():
       read T
       for each test case:
           read N, M, K
           read roads
           read Q
           read conditions
           result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)
           print(result)
   ```

4. **Final Python Code**:
```python

    dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

    # Create adjacency list for roads
    adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for u, v in roads:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues that caused it to fail the tests.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Ryan can move between cities connected by roads or stay in the same city.
   - We need to count the number of valid paths Ryan can take over K seconds while satisfying specific conditions about where he must be at certain times.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - The `dp` table is initialized correctly, where `dp[time][city]` represents the number of ways to be in `city` at `time`.
   - The base case `dp[0][1] = 1` is also correct, indicating that Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - The nested loops for filling the `dp` table are not correctly implemented. The logic for updating the number of ways to reach each city based on its neighbors is flawed. Specifically, the code does not correctly account for the fact that Ryan can also stay in the same city.
   - The adjacency list is created correctly, but the way we update the `dp` values does not consider the staying option.

4. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The logic for checking the conditions is correct, but if the `dp` table is not filled correctly, the results will be incorrect.

5. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The main mistake is in the way the `dp` table is updated. We need to ensure that for each city, we consider both moving to adjacent cities and staying in the same city.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Update the DP Table**:
   - For each city, we need to add the number of ways to stay in the same city from the previous time step.
   - We also need to ensure that we are correctly iterating through all cities and their neighbors.

2. **Revised Pseudocode**:
   ```
   function count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
       initialize dp array of size (K+1) x (N+1) with all zeros
       dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

       for time from 1 to K:
           for each city from 1 to N:
               dp[time][city] += dp[time-1][city]  # Stay in the same city
               for each neighbor in adj[city]:
                   dp[time][neighbor] += dp[time-1][city]  # Move to neighbor
                   dp[time][neighbor] %= MOD  # Ensure we take modulo

       # Check conditions
       valid_paths = 1
       for each condition (a_i, b_i):
           valid_paths *= dp[b_i][a_i]
           valid_paths %= MOD

       return valid_paths
   ```

3. **Final Python Code**:
```python
def count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    # Initialize the dp array
    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]
    dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

    # Create adjacency list for roads
    adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for u, v in roads:
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)

    # Fill the dp array
    for time in range(1, K + 1):
        for city in range(1, N + 1):
            dp[time][city] = dp[time - 1][city]  # Stay in the same city
            for neighbor in adj[city]:
                dp[time][neighbor] = (dp[time][neighbor] + dp[time - 1][city]) % MOD

    # Check conditions
    valid_paths = 1
    for a_i, b_i in conditions:
        valid_paths = (valid_paths * dp[b_i][a_i]) % MOD

    return valid_paths

def main():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N, M, K = map(int, input().split())
        roads = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(M)]
        Q = int(input())
        conditions = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(Q)]
        result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)
        print(result)

main()
```

### Summary of Changes:
- The `dp` table is now updated to include the option of staying in the same city.
- The modulo operation is applied correctly to prevent overflow.
- The overall structure remains the same, but the logic for filling the `dp` table is corrected. 

This should resolve the issues and allow the code to pass all tests.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues that caused it to fail the tests again.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Ryan can move between cities connected by roads or stay in the same city.
   - We need to count the number of valid paths Ryan can take over K seconds while satisfying specific conditions about where he must be at certain times.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - The `dp` table is initialized correctly, where `dp[time][city]` represents the number of ways to be in `city` at `time`.
   - The base case `dp[0][1] = 1` is also correct, indicating that Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - The logic for filling the `dp` table is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly propagate the number of ways to reach each city from its neighbors. Specifically, the way we are updating the `dp` values does not ensure that all paths are counted correctly.
   - The update for staying in the same city is correct, but the update for moving to adjacent cities needs to be revised.

4. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The logic for checking the conditions is correct, but if the `dp` table is not filled correctly, the results will be incorrect.

5. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The main mistake is in the way the `dp` table is updated. We need to ensure that for each city, we consider both moving to adjacent cities and staying in the same city correctly.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Update the DP Table**:
   - For each city, we need to add the number of ways to stay in the same city from the previous time step.
   - We also need to ensure that we are correctly iterating through all cities and their neighbors.

2. **Revised Pseudocode**:
   ```
   function count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
       initialize dp array of size (K+1) x (N+1) with all zeros
       dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

       for time from 1 to K:
           for each city from 1 to N:
               dp[time][city] += dp[time-1][city]  # Stay in the same city
               for each neighbor in adj[city]:
                   dp[time][neighbor] += dp[time-1][city]  # Move to neighbor
                   dp[time][neighbor] %= MOD  # Ensure we take modulo

       # Check conditions
       valid_paths = 1
       for each condition (a_i, b_i):
           valid_paths *= dp[b_i][a_i]
           valid_paths %= MOD

       return valid_paths
   ```

3. **Final Python Code**:
```python
def count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    # Initialize the dp array
    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]
    dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

    # Create adjacency list for roads
    adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for u, v in roads:
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)

    # Fill the dp array
    for time in range(1, K + 1):
        for city in range(1, N + 1):
            dp[time][city] = dp[time - 1][city]  # Stay in the same city
            for neighbor in adj[city]:
                dp[time][city] = (dp[time][city] + dp[time - 1][neighbor]) % MOD  # Move to neighbor

    # Check conditions
    valid_paths = 1
    for a_i, b_i in conditions:
        valid_paths = (valid_paths * dp[b_i][a_i]) % MOD

    return valid_paths

def main():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N, M, K = map(int, input().split())
        roads = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(M)]
        Q = int(input())

        result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine the number of valid paths Ryan can take through a network of cities connected by roads, given specific conditions about where he must be at certain times. The approach involved using dynamic programming to track the number of ways to reach each city at each second.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Dynamic Programming**: The solution required maintaining a 2D DP table where `dp[time][city]` represents the number of ways to be in `city` at `time`. The base case was initialized with `dp[0][1] = 1`, indicating Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0.

2. **Adjacency List**: An adjacency list was created to represent the roads between cities, allowing for efficient traversal of connected cities.

3. **Path Counting**: The DP table was updated to account for both staying in the same city and moving to adjacent cities. This was a crucial step that needed careful implementation to ensure all paths were counted correctly.

### Issues Encountered:
- The initial implementations failed to correctly propagate the number of ways to reach each city, particularly in how the DP table was updated. The logic for moving to neighbors was not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect results.
- The conditions checking at the end of the computation were also not yielding the expected results due to the incorrect state of the DP table.

### Lessons Learned:
- It is essential to ensure that all possible transitions (staying and moving) are accurately reflected in the DP updates.
- Testing edge cases and ensuring that the DP table is filled correctly is crucial for the final output to be accurate.
- The importance of modular arithmetic in preventing overflow issues when dealing with large numbers in combinatorial problems.

### Final Code Snippet:
```python
def count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]
    dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

    adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for u, v in roads:
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)

    for time in range(1, K + 1):
        for city in range(1, N + 1):
            dp[time][city] = dp[time - 1][city]  # Stay in the same city
            for neighbor in adj[city]:
                dp[time][city] = (dp[time][city] + dp[time - 1][neighbor]) % MOD  # Move to neighbor

    valid_paths = 1
    for a_i, b_i in conditions:
        valid_paths = (valid_paths * dp[b_i][a_i]) % MOD

    return valid_paths
```

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Nadaca is a country with N$N$ cities. These cities are numbered 1$1$ through N$N$ and connected by M$M$ bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.
Initially, Ryan is in city 1$1$. At each of the following K$K$ seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has Q$Q$ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),â€¦,(aQ,bQ)$(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots, (a_Q, b_Q)$ meaning that during this K$K$-second trip, for each valid i$i$, he wants to be in city ai$a_i$ after exactly bi$b_i$ seconds.
Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7$10^9 + 7$. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,â€¦,K$1, 2, \ldots, K$ seconds.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T$T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N$N$, M$M$ and K$K$.
- Each of the next M$M$ lines contains two space-separated integers u$u$ and v$v$ denoting a road between cities u$u$ and v$v$.
- The next line contains a single integer Q$Q$.
- Q$Q$ lines follow. For each i$i$ (1â‰¤iâ‰¤Q$1 \le i \le Q$), the i$i$-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers ai$a_i$ and bi$b_i$.

Ryan starts in city 1 and can move to adjacent cities or stay in his current city. We need to count the number of valid paths that satisfy all given conditions after a specified number of seconds.

2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways Ryan can be in each city at each second. We will maintain a 2D array where the rows represent the time (from 0 to K) and the columns represent the cities (from 1 to N). For each second, we will update the number of ways to reach each city based on the number of ways to reach adjacent cities in the previous second. After processing all seconds, we will check the conditions to ensure Ryan is in the required cities at the specified times and count the valid paths.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
       initialize dp array of size (K+1) x (N+1) with all zeros
       dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

       for time from 1 to K:
           for each city from 1 to N:
               for each road (u, v):
                   if city is u:
                       dp[time][v] += dp[time-1][u]
                   if city is v:
                       dp[time][u] += dp[time-1][v]

       # Check conditions
       valid_paths = 1
       for each condition (a_i, b_i):
           valid_paths *= dp[b_i][a_i]
           valid_paths %= (10^9 + 7)

       return valid_paths

   function main():
       read T
       for each test case:
           read N, M, K
           read roads
           read Q
           read conditions
           result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)
           print(result)
   ```

4. **Final Python Code**:
```python
def count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    # Initialize the dp array
    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]
    dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

    # Create adjacency list for roads
    adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for u, v in roads:
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)

    # Fill the dp array
    for time in range(1, K + 1):
        for city in range(1, N + 1):
            for neighbor in adj[city]:
                dp[time][neighbor] = (dp[time][neighbor] + dp[time - 1][city]) % MOD

    # Check conditions
    valid_paths = 1
    for a_i, b_i in conditions:
        valid_paths = (valid_paths * dp[b_i][a_i]) % MOD

    return valid_paths

def main():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N, M, K = map(int, input().split())
        roads = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(M)]
        Q = int(input())
        conditions = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(Q)]
        result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)
        print(result)

main()
```

This code initializes a dynamic programming table to track the number of ways to reach each city at each second, updates the table based on the roads, and finally checks the conditions to count the valid paths. The results are printed for each test case.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues that caused it to fail the tests.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Ryan can move between cities connected by roads or stay in the same city.
   - We need to count the number of valid paths Ryan can take over K seconds while satisfying specific conditions about where he must be at certain times.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - The `dp` table is initialized correctly, where `dp[time][city]` represents the number of ways to be in `city` at `time`.
   - The base case `dp[0][1] = 1` is also correct, indicating that Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - The nested loops for filling the `dp` table are not correctly implemented. The logic for updating the number of ways to reach each city based on its neighbors is flawed. Specifically, the code does not correctly account for the fact that Ryan can also stay in the same city.
   - The adjacency list is created correctly, but the way we update the `dp` values does not consider the staying option.

4. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The logic for checking the conditions is correct, but if the `dp` table is not filled correctly, the results will be incorrect.

5. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The main mistake is in the way the `dp` table is updated. We need to ensure that for each city, we consider both moving to adjacent cities and staying in the same city.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Update the DP Table**:
   - For each city, we need to add the number of ways to stay in the same city from the previous time step.
   - We also need to ensure that we are correctly iterating through all cities and their neighbors.

2. **Revised Pseudocode**:
   ```
   function count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
       initialize dp array of size (K+1) x (N+1) with all zeros
       dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

       for time from 1 to K:
           for each city from 1 to N:
               dp[time][city] += dp[time-1][city]  # Stay in the same city
               for each neighbor in adj[city]:
                   dp[time][neighbor] += dp[time-1][city]  # Move to neighbor
                   dp[time][neighbor] %= MOD  # Ensure we take modulo

       # Check conditions
       valid_paths = 1
       for each condition (a_i, b_i):
           valid_paths *= dp[b_i][a_i]
           valid_paths %= MOD

       return valid_paths
   ```

3. **Final Python Code**:
```python
def count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    # Initialize the dp array
    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]
    dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

    # Create adjacency list for roads
    adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for u, v in roads:
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)

    # Fill the dp array
    for time in range(1, K + 1):
        for city in range(1, N + 1):
            dp[time][city] = dp[time - 1][city]  # Stay in the same city
            for neighbor in adj[city]:
                dp[time][neighbor] = (dp[time][neighbor] + dp[time - 1][city]) % MOD

    # Check conditions
    valid_paths = 1
    for a_i, b_i in conditions:
        valid_paths = (valid_paths * dp[b_i][a_i]) % MOD

    return valid_paths

def main():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N, M, K = map(int, input().split())
        roads = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(M)]
        Q = int(input())
        conditions = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(Q)]
        result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)
        print(result)

main()
```

### Summary of Changes:
- The `dp` table is now updated to include the option of staying in the same city.
- The modulo operation is applied correctly to prevent overflow.
- The overall structure remains the same, but the logic for filling the `dp` table is corrected. 

This should resolve the issues and allow the code to pass all tests.

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Staying in the Same City**: The `dp` table now correctly accounts for the option of Ryan staying in the same city at each time step.
2. **Correct Neighbor Updates**: The update for moving to neighbors is now correctly implemented, ensuring that all paths are counted.
3. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is applied consistently to prevent overflow issues.

This code should now correctly compute the number of valid paths Ryan can take while satisfying the given conditions.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [prompt] Based on the previous analysis and the insights gained, I will revise the solution to ensure it correctly counts the number of valid paths Ryan can take while satisfying the given conditions. The key points to address are:

1. **Correctly Update the DP Table**: Ensure that the number of ways to stay in the same city and move to adjacent cities is accurately reflected in the DP table.
2. **Handle Edge Cases**: Ensure that the conditions are checked properly and that the results are computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    # Initialize the dp array
    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]
    dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

    # Create adjacency list for roads
    adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
    for u, v in roads:
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)

    # Fill the dp array
    for time in range(1, K + 1):
        for city in range(1, N + 1):
            dp[time][city] = dp[time - 1][city]  # Stay in the same city
            for neighbor in adj[city]:
                dp[time][city] = (dp[time][city] + dp[time - 1][neighbor]) % MOD  # Move to neighbor

    # Check conditions
    valid_paths = 1
    for a_i, b_i in conditions:
        valid_paths = (valid_paths * dp[b_i][a_i]) % MOD

    return valid_paths

def main():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N, M, K = map(int, input().split())
        roads = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(M)]
        Q = int(input())
        conditions = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(Q)]
        result = count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions)
        print(result)

main()
```

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 669 [generation text] In reflecting on my attempts to solve the problem, I realized that my approach to filling the dynamic programming (DP) table was flawed, particularly in how I handled the transitions between states. The official solution provided a more effective method for managing the adjacency of cities and the conditions Ryan needed to meet.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:
1. **Adjacency List Creation**: The official solution constructs an adjacency list `X` to represent the connections between cities. This allows for efficient traversal of neighboring cities when updating the DP states.

2. **Initialization of DP Table**: The DP table `A` is initialized such that `A[0][0]` is set to 1, indicating that Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0. The subsequent rows are updated based on the conditions provided, ensuring that only valid states are considered.

3. **Backward Iteration**: The official solution iterates backward through time (from K-1 to 0), updating the DP table based on the possible transitions from neighboring cities. This approach ensures that all paths leading to a city at a given time are accounted for before moving to the next time step.

4. **Condition Handling**: The conditions are directly applied to the DP table, allowing for a straightforward check of where Ryan must be at specific times.

### Reasons for My Approach's Failure:
- **Incorrect State Updates**: My implementation did not correctly propagate the number of ways to reach each city from its neighbors. I mistakenly updated the DP table without properly considering all possible transitions.
- **Lack of Backward Iteration**: I did not utilize a backward iteration approach, which is crucial for ensuring that all paths are counted correctly before moving to the next time step.
- **Condition Application**: My handling of conditions was not integrated effectively into the DP updates, leading to incorrect results.

Overall, the official solution's method of managing adjacency, initializing the DP table, and iterating backward through time provided a clearer and more effective approach to solving the problem. This experience highlights the importance of carefully structuring state transitions in dynamic programming problems and the value of leveraging adjacency lists for graph-related challenges.
