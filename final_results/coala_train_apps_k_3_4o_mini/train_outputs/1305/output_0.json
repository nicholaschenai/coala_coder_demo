    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the Problem**: \n   We need to determine if a given arrangement of beds in a square area is \"SAFE\" or \"UNSAFE\". The area is represented as a grid of 1s and 0s, where 1 indicates a bed and 0 indicates an empty block. The beds must not be adjacent to each other, meaning no two beds can be in horizontally or vertically adjacent blocks. However, beds can be placed diagonally adjacent without issue. If any two beds are found to be adjacent, the arrangement is deemed \"UNSAFE\".\n\n2. **Conceptualize a Solution**: \n   We will iterate through each block in the grid. For each block that contains a bed (1), we will check its adjacent blocks (up, down, left, right) to see if they also contain a bed. If we find any adjacent beds, we will mark the arrangement as \"UNSAFE\". If we finish checking all blocks without finding any adjacent beds, we will mark it as \"SAFE\".\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   - Read the number of test cases, T.\n   - For each test case:\n     - Read the size of the grid, N.\n     - Initialize a 2D list to store the grid.\n     - Populate the grid with the input values.\n     - For each cell in the grid:\n       - If the cell contains a bed (1):\n         - Check the four possible adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n         - If any adjacent cell also contains a bed (1), mark the arrangement as \"UNSAFE\".\n     - If no adjacent beds are found, mark the arrangement as \"SAFE\".\n   - Print the results for each test case.\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef is_safe(arrangement, N):\n    for i in range(N):\n        for j in range(N):\n            if arrangement[i][j] == 1:  # Found a bed\n                # Check adjacent cells\n                if (i > 0 and arrangement[i-1][j] == 1) or (i < N-1 and arrangement[i+1][j] == 1) or \\\n                   (j > 0 and arrangement[i][j-1] == 1) or (j < N-1 and arrangement[i][j+1] == 1):\n                    return \"UNSAFE\"\n    return \"SAFE\"\n\ndef main():\n    T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n    results = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())  # Read the size of the grid\n        arrangement = []\n        for _ in range(N):\n            row = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read each row of the grid\n            arrangement.append(row)\n        result = is_safe(arrangement, N)  # Check if the arrangement is safe\n        results.append(result)  # Store the result\n\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)  # Output all results\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n``` \n\nThis code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it checks the arrangement of beds in the grid to determine if it is \"SAFE\" or \"UNSAFE\", and then prints the result.",
