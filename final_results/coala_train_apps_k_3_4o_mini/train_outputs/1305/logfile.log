## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to check if a given arrangement of beds in a square area is safe. The area is represented as a grid of 1s and 0s, where 1 indicates a bed is present and 0 indicates it is not. The beds must not be adjacent to each other, meaning no two beds can be in horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent blocks. If any two beds are adjacent, we will classify the arrangement as "UNSAFE"; otherwise, it will be "SAFE".

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   We will iterate through each test case and for each grid, we will check every cell. If we find a bed (1), we will check its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) to see if any of them also contain a bed. If we find any adjacent beds, we will mark the arrangement as "UNSAFE". If we finish checking the entire grid without finding any adjacent beds, we will mark it as "SAFE".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function check_beds_safety(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N

                       if any adjacent cell is also 1:
                           is_safe = False
                           break

               print "SAFE"
           else:
               print "UNSAFE"
   ```

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine how many rooms in two houses can be completely tiled using tiles from boxes, where the i-th box contains i tiles and each room has an area of \(i^2\). The key insight was that only even-numbered boxes could be used to tile two rooms completely, as the tiles need to be split evenly between the two rooms.

    Initially, I miscalculated the total number of rooms that could be tiled by simply counting all even boxes and multiplying by 2, which led to incorrect outputs. The correct approach required understanding that for each even box \(i\), it could tile two rooms of size \((i/2)^2\) only if \(i\) was less than or equal to \(N\).

    The final solution should have focused on counting how many even numbers exist up to \(N\) and then determining how many rooms could be tiled based on those even numbers. The correct formula for the number of rooms that can be tiled is \(N // 2\), as each even number contributes exactly 2 rooms.

    Here’s the corrected code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(N):
        return (N // 2) * 2  # Each even number contributes 2 rooms

    def main():
        T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N
            result = count_tiled_rooms(N)  # Calculate the total tiled rooms
            print(result)  # Output the result

    main()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing the problem requirements and ensuring that the logic aligns with the constraints provided.

[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of determining the maximum number of magnets that can attract pieces of iron, I learned the importance of carefully managing the conditions for attraction, particularly the influence of distance, conducting sheets, and blocked cells. The initial approach failed primarily due to incorrect handling of the attraction power calculation and the management of magnets and irons when blocked cells were encountered.

    Key strategies that worked included:
    - Iterating through the string to collect indices of magnets and irons, and processing them in segments separated by blocked cells.
    - Using a set to track which irons had already been attracted, ensuring that each could only be used once.

    The final solution involved a clear structure where the attraction power was calculated based on the distance and the number of conducting sheets between magnets and irons. The code snippet below represents the final working solution:

    ```python
    def max_magnets(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, input().split())
            S = input().strip()
        
            magnets = []
            irons = []
            count = 0
        
            for i in range(N):
                if S[i] == 'M':
                    magnets.append(i)
                elif S[i] == 'I':
                    irons.append(i)
                elif S[i] == 'X':
                    count += process_attractions(magnets, irons, K, S)
                    magnets.clear()
                    irons.clear()
        
            count += process_attractions(magnets, irons, K, S)
            print(count)

    def process_attractions(magnets, irons, K, S):
        count = 0
        used_irons = set()
        for m in magnets:
            for i in irons:
                if i not in used_irons:
                    distance = abs(m - i)
                    sheets = count_sheets_between(S, m, i)
                    power = K + 1 - distance - sheets
                    if power > 0:
                        count += 1
                        used_irons.add(i)
                        break
        return count

    def count_sheets_between(S, m, i):
        return S[min(m, i) + 1:max(m, i)].count(':')
    ```

    This experience reinforced the need for careful condition checking and the management of state (used magnets and irons) in problems involving pairing or matching elements based on specific criteria.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        The  Chef  has bought $N$ boxes of Tiles. The number of tiles present in  $i^{th}$ box is  $i$  ($i   $ varies from $1$ to $N$) . The Chef  has two houses  with  $N$  rooms  each, whose  floors  is a square with area $(i*i)$ ,i varies from $(1....N)$. He want to distribute equal number of tiles from $i^{th}$ box to any two rooms (each room must belong to one house ) such that all tiles  of $i^ { th}$  box is used and floor of  both rooms of different houses are tiled completely.
        Since chef is busy doing some other works so he wants your help to count the total number of rooms of both houses that will be tiled completely.
        Note $:$ size of  each tile present in boxes has length and breadth equal to $1$. It is not mandatory to use all the boxes.
        A room should be tilled completely from a single box.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the Problem**: 
           The Chef has bought N boxes of tiles, where the i-th box contains i tiles. He has two houses, each with N rooms, and the area of the i-th room is i*i. The goal is to determine how many rooms in both houses can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes, ensuring that each room is tiled with tiles from a single box and that the same number of tiles is used in two rooms (one from each house).

        2. **Conceptualize a Solution**: 
           For each box i, the number of tiles is i. To tile two rooms completely, we need to check if the number of tiles in the box can be evenly divided between the two rooms. This means that the area of the rooms (i*i) must be equal to the number of tiles used from the box. Therefore, we need to find pairs of rooms (one from each house) that can be tiled using the tiles from the boxes. The maximum room number that can be tiled completely is determined by the largest box that can tile the rooms.

        3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
           - Initialize a counter for the total number of rooms tiled.
           - For each box from 1 to N:
             - Check if the box can tile two rooms (i.e., if i is even).
             - If it can, increment the counter by 2 (for the two rooms).
           - Output the total count of rooms tiled for each test case.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] 1. **Restate the Problem**: 
   We need to determine if a given arrangement of beds in a square area is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". The area is represented as a grid of 1s and 0s, where 1 indicates a bed and 0 indicates an empty block. The beds must not be adjacent to each other, meaning no two beds can be in horizontally or vertically adjacent blocks. However, beds can be placed diagonally adjacent without issue. If any two beds are found to be adjacent, the arrangement is deemed "UNSAFE".

2. **Conceptualize a Solution**: 
   We will iterate through each block in the grid. For each block that contains a bed (1), we will check its adjacent blocks (up, down, left, right) to see if they also contain a bed. If we find any adjacent beds, we will mark the arrangement as "UNSAFE". If we finish checking all blocks without finding any adjacent beds, we will mark it as "SAFE".

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   - Read the number of test cases, T.
   - For each test case:
     - Read the size of the grid, N.
     - Initialize a 2D list to store the grid.
     - Populate the grid with the input values.
     - For each cell in the grid:
       - If the cell contains a bed (1):
         - Check the four possible adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).
         - If any adjacent cell also contains a bed (1), mark the arrangement as "UNSAFE".
     - If no adjacent beds are found, mark the arrangement as "SAFE".
   - Print the results for each test case.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine if a grid arrangement of beds (represented by 1s) was "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" based on the adjacency of beds. The key concept was to check for adjacent beds in the grid, specifically in the up, down, left, and right directions, while allowing diagonal placements.

The solution involved iterating through each cell in the grid and checking the four possible adjacent cells for any beds. If any adjacent cell contained a bed, the arrangement was marked as "UNSAFE". If no adjacent beds were found after checking the entire grid, it was marked as "SAFE". 

The implementation was straightforward and effective, utilizing a nested loop to traverse the grid and simple conditional checks to determine adjacency. The final code successfully handled multiple test cases and produced the correct output for the provided examples.

Key takeaways include the importance of understanding grid traversal and adjacency checks, which are common patterns in similar problems. The solution was efficient given the constraints, and no unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] The official solution effectively checks for adjacent beds in a grid by iterating through the rows and columns separately. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of test cases and initializing a list to store results.

2. **Grid Construction**: For each test case, it constructs a 2D list (grid) to represent the arrangement of beds.

3. **Row Check**: The solution first checks each row for adjacent beds by comparing each element with the next one in the same row. If two adjacent beds are found, it marks the arrangement as "UNSAFE" and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Column Check**: After checking rows, it checks each column for adjacent beds by comparing each element with the one directly below it. Again, if adjacent beds are found, it marks the arrangement as "UNSAFE".

5. **Final Result**: If no adjacent beds are found after both checks, it appends "SAFE" to the results list.

6. **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Key Takeaways:
- The official solution is efficient in that it checks for adjacency in a straightforward manner, ensuring that it only traverses the grid a minimal number of times.
- It uses a flag to indicate if an unsafe condition has been found, which allows for early termination of checks, improving performance.
- The separation of row and column checks simplifies the logic and makes it easier to understand.

### Reflection:
My initial approach was similar in concept but could have been optimized by directly checking for adjacent beds in both dimensions in a single pass. The official solution's method of using flags and breaking out of loops upon finding an unsafe condition is a good practice for improving efficiency. This experience highlights the importance of considering both time complexity and clarity in code structure when solving grid-based problems.

[Problem]
    Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
    The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
    The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
    This is a SAFE example:
    1 0
    0 1
    This is an UNSAFE example:
    0 1 1
    0 0 0
    1 0 0
    To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
    Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

    -----Input:-----
    - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
    - Next line contains $N$.
    - Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

    -----Output:-----
    For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 100$
    - $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
    - $2 \leq N \leq 100$

    -----Subtasks-----
    - 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$
    - 70 points : Original constraints

    -----Sample Input:-----
    2
    4
    1 0 1 0
    0 0 0 1
    0 1 0 0
    1 0 0 1
    4
    1 0 1 0
    0 0 0 0
    1 0 1 1
    0 1 0 0

    -----Sample Output:-----
    SAFE
    UNSAFE

    -----EXPLANATION:-----
    Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.
