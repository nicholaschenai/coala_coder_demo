[BEGIN PROBLEM]
On Miu's smart phone, there is a search feature which lets her search for a contact name by typing digits on the keypad where each digit may correspond to any of the characters given below it. For example, to search for TOM, she can type 866 and for MAX she can type 629.

Miu typed a random string of digits $S$ on the keypad while playing around, where each digit is between 2 and 9 inclusive. Now she wants to know the number of possible strings which would map to $S$. 
Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007)

-----Input:-----
- 
The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
- 
Each test case consists of a string $S$.

-----Output:-----
- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the count of all possible strings mod 1,000,000,007

-----Constraints-----
- 
1 <= $T$ <= 10
- 
1 <= $|S|$ <= 105

-----EXPLANATION:-----
- 
Example Case 1:

On the key 5, we have the character set JKL.

Hence the possible strings are J,K,L.

Hence the answer is 3 % (1000000007) = 3.  
- 
Example Case 2:
On key 7, we have the character set PQRS.

On key 2, we have the character set ABC.

Hence the possible strings are PA,PB,PC,QA,QB,QC,RA,RB,RC,SA,SB,SC.

Hence the answer is 12 % (1000000007) = 12.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Miu has a smartphone keypad where each digit from 2 to 9 corresponds to a set of letters. Given a string of digits, we need to determine how many different combinations of letters can be formed using those digits. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Each digit corresponds to a specific number of letters:
     - 2 -> ABC (3 letters)
     - 3 -> DEF (3 letters)
     - 4 -> GHI (3 letters)
     - 5 -> JKL (3 letters)
     - 6 -> MNO (3 letters)
     - 7 -> PQRS (4 letters)
     - 8 -> TUV (3 letters)
     - 9 -> WXYZ (4 letters)
   - For each digit in the input string, we can find out how many letters it corresponds to.
   - The total number of combinations can be calculated by multiplying the number of letters for each digit together.
   - Since the result can be large, we will take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define a function count_combinations(S):
       Initialize a dictionary mapping digits to their letter counts
       Initialize result to 1
       For each character in S:
           Convert character to integer
           Multiply result by the number of letters corresponding to that digit
           Take result modulo 1000000007
       Return result

   Read integer T from input
   For i from 0 to T-1:
       Read string S from input
       Print count_combinations(S)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def count_combinations(S):
    # Mapping of digits to the number of corresponding letters
    digit_to_count = {
        '2': 3,  # ABC
        '3': 3,  # DEF
        '4': 3,  # GHI

        '8': 3,  # TUV
        '9': 4   # WXYZ
    }
    
    result = 1
    MOD = 1000000007
    
    # Calculate the total combinations
    for char in S:
        result = (result * digit_to_count[char]) % MOD
    
    return result

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())

    S = input().strip()  # Read the string of digits

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

    [Previous Critique]:
        None
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
           The task is to determine how many subsets can be formed from the numbers 1 to N such that a specific number I appears in the K-th position of the subset when sorted. The output should be the count of such subsets for multiple queries, and since the result can be large, it should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
           To solve this problem, we need to:
           - Understand that for a number I to be in the K-th position of a subset, there must be exactly \(K-1\) numbers less than I in the subset.
           - The remaining numbers in the subset can be chosen from the numbers greater than I.
           - We can use combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of ways to choose \(K-1\) numbers from the \(I-1\) numbers less than I and any number of numbers from the \(N-I\) numbers greater than I.
           - The total number of valid subsets can be calculated using combinations and powers of 2.

        3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
           ```
           function calculate_combinations(n, k):
               if k > n or k < 0:
                   return 0
               return factorial(n) / (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))

           function count_subsets(N, I, K):
               if K > I or K < 1:
                   return 0
               count_less_than_I = calculate_combinations(I - 1, K - 1)
               count_greater_than_I = 2^(N - I)
               return (count_less_than_I * count_greater_than_I) % (10^9 + 7)

           function main():
               read T
               for each test case:
                   read N, Q
                   for each query:
                       read I, K
                       result = count_subsets(N, I, K)
                       print(result)
           ```

        4. **Final Python Code**:
        ```python
        def factorial(n):
            if n == 0 or n == 1:
                return 1
            result = 1
            for i in range(2, n + 1):
                result = (result * i) % (10**9 + 7)
            return result

        def calculate_combinations(n, k):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return (factorial(n) * pow(factorial(k), -1, 10**9 + 7) * pow(factorial(n - k), -1, 10**9 + 7)) % (10**9 + 7)

        def count_subsets(N, I, K):
            if K > I or K < 1:
                return 0
            count_less_than_I = calculate_combinations(I - 1, K - 1)
            count_greater_than_I = pow(2, N - I, 10**9 + 7)
            return (count_less_than_I * count_greater_than_I) % (10**9 + 7)

        def main():
            MOD = 10**9 + 7
            T = int(input())
            for _ in range(T):
                N, Q = map(int, input().split())
                for __ in range(Q):
                    I, K = map(int, input().split())
                    result = count_subsets(N, I, K)
                    print(result)

        main()
        ``` 

        This code reads the number of test cases and queries, processes each query to calculate the number of valid subsets, and prints the results. The use of modular arithmetic ensures that we handle large numbers appropriately.

        Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
        - N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
        - Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
        - The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
        He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
        You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where i≤j$i \leq j$.

        -----Input:-----
        - The first line contains string S$S$ — consisting of lowercase English letters.
        - The second line contains string T$T$ — consisting of lowercase English letters.
        - Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ — the number of queries.
        - Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

        -----Output:-----
        - Print Q$Q$ lines. The i$i$-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
           The task is to create a pyramid of strings based on a given string \( S \). Each row \( N \) of the pyramid contains \( N \) characters, starting with the first character of \( S \) and continuing in a cyclic manner through \( S \) until the row is filled. We need to answer multiple queries about how many times a smaller string \( T \) appears as a substring in the specified row of the pyramid.

        2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
           - For each query, we need to determine the string that corresponds to row \( N \) of the pyramid.
           - The string for row \( N \) can be constructed by taking the first character of \( S \) and then appending characters from \( S \) in a cyclic manner until we reach \( N \) characters.
           - Once we have the string for row \( N \), we can count the occurrences of string \( T \) within it. This can be done by sliding through the string and checking for matches.

        3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
           ```
           function get_row_string(S, N):
               length_S = length of S
               row_string = ""
               for i from 0 to N-1:
                   row_string += S[i % length_S]
               return row_string

           function count_occurrences(row_string, T):
               count = 0
               length_T = length of T
               for i from 0 to length of row_string - length_T:
                   if row_string[i:i+length_T] == T:
                       count += 1
               return count

           function main():
               read S
               read T
               read Q
               for each query:
                   read N
                   row_string = get_row_string(S, N)
                   result = count_occurrences(row_string, T)
                   print(result)
           ```

        4. **Final Python Code**:
        ```python
        def get_row_string(S, N):
            length_S = len(S)
            row_string = ""
            for i in range(N):
                row_string += S[i % length_S]
            return row_string

        def count_occurrences(row_string, T):
            count = 0
            length_T = len(T)
            for i in range(len(row_string) - length_T + 1):
                if row_string[i:i + length_T] == T:
                    count += 1
            return count

        def main():
            S = input().strip()  # Read the string S
            T = input().strip()  # Read the string T
            Q = int(input().strip())  # Read the number of queries
            for _ in range(Q):
                N = int(input().strip())  # Read each query N
                row_string = get_row_string(S, N)  # Get the row string for N
                result = count_occurrences(row_string, T)  # Count occurrences of T
                print(result)  # Print the result

        main()
        ``` 

        This code reads the input strings and the number of queries, constructs the appropriate row string for each query, counts the occurrences of \( T \) in that string, and prints the results.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to calculate the number of valid schedules for Chef's restaurant, where dishes must be served over \(N\) days with specific constraints: consecutive days must have different dishes, and the first and last dishes must also be different.

    ### Key Insights:
    1. **Understanding the Combinatorial Nature**: The problem required a combinatorial approach to count valid arrangements based on the number of days. The choices for each day depended on the previous day's choice, leading to a recursive pattern.

    2. **Formulating the Correct Logic**:
       - For \(N = 2\): The valid combinations are \(4 \times 3\).
       - For \(N = 3\): The valid combinations are \(4 \times 3 \times 2\).
       - For \(N \geq 4\): The correct formula should be \(4 \times 3^{(N-1)}\) because:
         - The first day has 4 choices.
         - The second day has 3 choices.
         - Each of the next \(N-2\) days has 3 choices.
         - The last day must be different from the first dish, which is already accounted for in the choices.

    ### Errors and Fixes:
    - Initially, I miscalculated the formula for \(N \geq 4\) by incorrectly considering the last dish's constraints. The correct approach was to ensure that the last dish is different from the first while maintaining the choices for the middle days.
    - The final formula for \(N \geq 4\) was adjusted to correctly reflect the choices available.

    ### Final Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def calculate_schedules(N):
        if N == 2:
            return (4 * 3) % (10**9 + 7)
        elif N == 3:
            return (4 * 3 * 2) % (10**9 + 7)
        else:
            return (4 * 3 * (3 ** (N - 2))) % (10**9 + 7)

    def main():
        T = int(input())
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            result = calculate_schedules(N)
            print(result)

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering constraints in combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accurately reflected in the formulas used.

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] 1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
   Miu has a smartphone keypad where each digit corresponds to a set of letters. When she types a string of digits, we need to determine how many possible letter combinations can be formed from that string. Each digit from 2 to 9 corresponds to a specific number of letters, and the result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
   - Each digit corresponds to a specific number of letters:
     - 2 -> 3 letters (A, B, C)
     - 3 -> 3 letters (D, E, F)
     - 4 -> 3 letters (G, H, I)
     - 5 -> 3 letters (J, K, L)
     - 6 -> 3 letters (M, N, O)
     - 7 -> 4 letters (P, Q, R, S)
     - 8 -> 3 letters (T, U, V)
     - 9 -> 4 letters (W, X, Y, Z)
   - For each digit in the input string, we can determine the number of letters it can represent.
   - The total number of combinations for the entire string is the product of the number of letters for each digit.
   - Since the result can be large, we will take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
On Miu's smart phone, there is a search feature which lets her search for a contact name by typing digits on the keypad where each digit may correspond to any of the characters given below it. For example, to search for TOM, she can type 866 and for MAX she can type 629.

| PQRS | TUV | WXYZ |
+------+-----+------+
|      |  0  |      |
+------+-----+------+

Miu typed a random string of digits $S$ on the keypad while playing around, where each digit is between 2 and 9 inclusive. Now she wants to know the number of possible strings which would map to $S$. 
Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007)

-----Input:-----
- 
The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
- 
Each test case consists of a string $S$.

-----Output:-----
- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the count of all possible strings mod 1,000,000,007

-----Constraints-----
- 
1 <= $T$ <= 10
- 
1 <= $|S|$ <= 105

-----Subtasks-----

- 1 <= $|S|$ <= 10
Subtask #2 (90 points):

-----Sample Output:-----

12  

-----EXPLANATION:-----
- 
Example Case 1:

On the key 5, we have the character set JKL.

Hence the possible strings are J,K,L.

Hence the answer is 3 % (1000000007) = 3.  
- 
Example Case 2:
On key 7, we have the character set PQRS.

On key 2, we have the character set ABC.

Hence the possible strings are PA,PB,PC,QA,QB,QC,RA,RB,RC,SA,SB,SC.

Hence the answer is 12 % (1000000007) = 12.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] In this task, I was required to determine the number of possible letter combinations that can be formed from a string of digits typed on a smartphone keypad. Each digit corresponds to a specific set of letters, and the challenge was to compute the total combinations efficiently, especially given the constraints where the length of the string could be up to 100,000.

The core concept involved mapping each digit (from 2 to 9) to its respective number of letters. The solution required calculating the product of the number of letters for each digit in the input string, while also applying modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging a dictionary for quick lookups of letter counts.

The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was sound, as evidenced by passing the provided test cases. The code structure was clear, with a main function to handle input and a separate function for the combination calculation. This separation of concerns made the code easy to read and maintain. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding mappings and modular arithmetic in combinatorial problems.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
On Miu's smart phone, there is a search feature which lets her search for a contact name by typing digits on the keypad where each digit may correspond to any of the characters given below it. For example, to search for TOM, she can type 866 and for MAX she can type 629.
+------+-----+------+
|   1  |  2  |   3  |
|      | ABC |  DEF |
+------+-----+------+
|   4  |  5  |   6  |
|  GHI | JKL |  MNO |
+------+-----+------+
|   7  |  8  |   9  |
| PQRS | TUV | WXYZ |
+------+-----+------+
|      |  0  |      |
+------+-----+------+

Miu typed a random string of digits $S$ on the keypad while playing around, where each digit is between 2 and 9 inclusive. Now she wants to know the number of possible strings which would map to $S$. 
Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007)

-----Input:-----
- 
The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
- 
Each test case consists of a string $S$.

-----Output:-----
- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the count of all possible strings mod 1,000,000,007

-----Constraints-----
- 
1 <= $T$ <= 10
- 
1 <= $|S|$ <= 105

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (10 points):
- 1 <= $|S|$ <= 10
Subtask #2 (90 points):
- Original Constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
2

5

72  

-----Sample Output:-----
3

12  

-----EXPLANATION:-----
- 
Example Case 1:

On the key 5, we have the character set JKL.

Hence the possible strings are J,K,L.

Hence the answer is 3 % (1000000007) = 3.  
- 
Example Case 2:
On key 7, we have the character set PQRS.

On key 2, we have the character set ABC.

Hence the possible strings are PA,PB,PC,QA,QB,QC,RA,RB,RC,SA,SB,SC.

Hence the answer is 12 % (1000000007) = 12.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [prompt] 1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
   Miu has a smartphone keypad where each digit corresponds to a set of letters. When she types a string of digits, we need to determine how many possible letter combinations can be formed from that string. Each digit from 2 to 9 corresponds to a specific number of letters, and the result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
   - Each digit corresponds to a specific number of letters:
     - 2 -> 3 letters (A, B, C)
     - 3 -> 3 letters (D, E, F)
     - 4 -> 3 letters (G, H, I)
     - 5 -> 3 letters (J, K, L)
     - 6 -> 3 letters (M, N, O)
     - 7 -> 4 letters (P, Q, R, S)
     - 8 -> 3 letters (T, U, V)
     - 9 -> 4 letters (W, X, Y, Z)
   - For each digit in the input string, we can determine the number of letters it can represent.
   - The total number of combinations for the entire string is the product of the number of letters for each digit.
   - Since the result can be large, we will take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function count_combinations(S):
       MOD = 10^9 + 7
       letter_count = {
           '2': 3,

           S = read string of digits
           result = count_combinations(S)
           print(result)

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution

   n/=10
 if(ans==1):
  print("0")
 else:
  print(ans %(1000000007))


INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem by iterating through each digit of the input number and calculating the number of possible letter combinations based on the digit's mapping on a phone keypad. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Digit Mapping**: The solution uses a simple conditional structure to determine the number of letters corresponding to each digit:
   - Digits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 map to 3 letters.
   - Digits 7 and 9 map to 4 letters.
   - Digit 1 maps to 1 letter.
   - Digit 0 is ignored.

2. **Iterative Calculation**: The solution processes the input number digit by digit, using a while loop. It extracts the last digit using modulo operation and updates the total combinations (`ans`) by multiplying the current count of combinations with the number of letters for that digit.

3. **Modular Arithmetic**: The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures that the result remains manageable and prevents overflow, which is crucial given the constraints.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution checks if the final answer is 1, which indicates that no valid combinations were found (e.g., if the input was only zeros). It then prints "0" in such cases.

5. **Efficiency**: The solution operates in linear time relative to the number of digits, making it efficient for the upper limit of input size.

In contrast, my initial approach was similar in logic but could have been more concise in handling the digit extraction and combination calculation. The official solution's use of integer division and modulo operations directly on the number instead of converting it to a string could also be more efficient in terms of space. 

Overall, the official solution is effective and efficient, and it highlights the importance of considering edge cases and using modular arithmetic in problems involving large numbers.
