    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   You start with one stick and want to craft a certain number of torches. Each torch requires one stick and one coal. You can trade sticks for more sticks or trade sticks for coal. The goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft the required number of torches.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals. Since you start with one stick, you need to acquire `k - 1` additional sticks. To get `k` coals, you need `k * y` sticks (since each coal requires `y` sticks). Therefore, the total number of sticks you need is `k - 1 + k * y`. After calculating the total sticks needed, you can determine how many trades are required to get that number of sticks, considering that each trade allows you to exchange one stick for `x` sticks.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function min_trades(t):\n       for each test case:\n           read x, y, k\n           total_sticks_needed = (k - 1) + (k * y)\n           total_trades_needed = total_sticks_needed // (x - 1)\n           if total_sticks_needed % (x - 1) != 0:\n               total_trades_needed += 1\n           total_trades_needed += k  // for k coals\n           print total_trades_needed\n\n   read t\n   min_trades(t)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef min_trades(t):\n    for _ in range(t):\n        # Read the values of x, y, and k\n        x, y, k = map(int, input().split())\n        \n        # Calculate the total number of sticks needed\n        total_sticks_needed = (k - 1) + (k * y)\n        \n        # Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required sticks\n        total_trades_needed = total_sticks_needed // (x - 1)\n        \n        # If there's a remainder, we need one more trade\n        if total_sticks_needed % (x - 1) != 0:\n            total_trades_needed += 1\n        \n        # Add the trades needed to get k coals\n        total_trades_needed += k\n        \n        # Print the result for the current test case\n        print(total_trades_needed)\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nt = int(input())\nmin_trades(t)\n```",
