Initially, you have one stick and want to craft $k$ torches. One torch can be crafted using one stick and one coal.\n\nHopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:  exchange $1$ stick for $x$ sticks (you lose $1$ stick and gain $x$ sticks).  exchange $y$ sticks for $1$ coal (you lose $y$ sticks and gain $1$ coal). \n\nDuring one trade, you can use only one of these two trade offers. You can use each trade offer any number of times you want to, in any order.\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches.

You can trade one stick to get a certain number of sticks (x) or trade a certain number of sticks (y) to get one coal. The goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft the required number of torches.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals. Since you start with one stick, you need to acquire `k - 1` additional sticks. For the coals, you need to trade `k * y` sticks to get `k` coals. Therefore, the total number of sticks needed is `k - 1 + k * y`. After trading for the required sticks, you can then trade for the coals. The number of trades can be calculated based on how many sticks you can get from each trade and how many trades you need to perform to reach the required number of sticks.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function minimum_trades(t, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           x, y, k = test_case\n           total_sticks_needed = k - 1 + k * y\n           trades_for_sticks = ceil(total_sticks_needed / (x - 1))\n           total_trades = trades_for_sticks + k\n           print(total_trades)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef minimum_trades(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for i in range(t):\n        x, y, k = test_cases[i]\n        \n        # Calculate the total number of sticks needed\n        total_sticks_needed = k - 1 + k * y\n        \n        # Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required sticks\n        # Each trade gives (x - 1) additional sticks\n        trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)  # Using integer division to round up\n        \n        # Total trades is the trades for sticks plus the trades for k coals\n        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + k\n        \n        # Store the result for this test case\n        results.append(total_trades)\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Read input\nt = int(input())\ntest_cases = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(t)]\n\n# Call the function with the input\nminimum_trades(t, test_cases)\n```"

The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the available days to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging simple loops and arithmetic.\n\n    The final implementation was clean and efficient, successfully passing all provided test cases. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all edge cases (like having fewer problems than needed for a single contest) are considered. The solution was implemented without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints given. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_contests(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    max_contests(T)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of clear problem understanding and systematic solution development.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to minimize the total uncompleted tasks Chef has after using buttons from a Time Machine over several days. The key concepts involved understanding how to optimally use two types of buttons: white buttons that reduce planned tasks and black buttons that increase completed tasks.\n\n    Throughout the attempts, the main issues revolved around the logic for using black and white buttons. The initial implementations failed to correctly manage the constraints of not exceeding planned tasks when using black buttons and not allowing negative uncompleted tasks. The calculation of remaining tasks and the application of button effects were not handled correctly, leading to incorrect outputs.\n\n    The strategies that seemed to work included sorting the button values in descending order to maximize their effects. However, the implementation of the logic for applying these buttons was flawed. The final calculation of uncompleted tasks needed to ensure that it only counted non-negative values.\n\n    The most significant learning point was the importance of carefully managing the conditions under which tasks can be completed or reduced, ensuring that the constraints of the problem are respected at all times. Future implementations should focus on clearly defining the conditions for using each button type and ensuring that the calculations reflect the intended logic accurately.\n\n    Here is the last attempted code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def min_uncompleted_tasks(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K, M = map(int, input().split())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            B = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            C = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            D = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n            C.sort(reverse=True)\n            D.sort(reverse=True)\n        \n            total_uncompleted = 0\n        \n            for day in range(N):\n                remaining_tasks = A[day] - B[day]\n            \n                for button in D:\n                    if remaining_tasks > 0 and B[day] < A[day]:\n                        can_add = min(button, A[day] - B[day])\n                        B[day] += can_add\n                        remaining_tasks -= can_add\n            \n                for button in C:\n                    if A[day] > 0:\n                        can_reduce = min(button, A[day])\n                        A[day] -= can_reduce\n            \n                total_uncompleted += max(0, A[day] - B[day])\n        \n            print(total_uncompleted)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    min_uncompleted_tasks(T)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience highlighted the need for careful attention to detail in problem constraints and the importance of thorough testing to ensure all edge cases are handled correctly.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution effectively simplifies the problem by directly calculating the total number of problems and determining how many contests can be formed in a straightforward manner. The key steps are:\n\n    1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it captures the number of setters (N), the number of problems required for a contest (K), and the number of days available (D).\n    2. **Problem Summation**: It computes the total number of problems created by summing the list of problems from each setter.\n    3. **Contest Calculation**: It calculates the maximum number of contests that can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required for each contest.\n    4. **Final Output**: It prints the minimum of the contests possible and the days available, ensuring that the output respects the constraints of the problem.\n\n    The official solution is concise and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for input and summation, which keeps the code clean and readable. \n\n    One insight from this experience is the importance of directly addressing the problem constraints in a clear manner. The official solution does this effectively by using a single line to compute the number of contests and another to print the result, which is both efficient and easy to understand. \n\n    Overall, the approach I took was similar, but the official solution's brevity and clarity highlight the effectiveness of straightforward calculations in competitive programming.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

Each torch requires one stick and one coal, and the player can trade sticks for more sticks or for coal. The key insight was to calculate the total number of sticks needed based on the number of torches and the requirements for coal.\n\nThe solution involved calculating the total sticks required as `(k - 1) + (k * y)`, where `k` is the number of torches and `y` is the number of sticks needed for one coal. The number of trades to acquire the necessary sticks was determined by dividing the total sticks needed by the effective gain from trading (which is `x - 1` sticks per trade). If there was a remainder, an additional trade was needed. Finally, the number of trades to acquire the coals was simply `k`.\n\nThe implementation was straightforward and passed all test cases, demonstrating that the approach was effective. The code was structured to read multiple test cases and output the results accordingly.

This means you need a total of `k - 1` additional sticks (since you start with one) and `k * y` sticks to acquire the required coals.\n\n2. **Combining Calculations**: The official solution cleverly combines the calculations for the total number of trades needed into one expression:\n   - It calculates the total number of sticks needed as `k + (y * k + k - 1 + x - 2) // (x - 1)`. This expression accounts for the additional sticks needed and the trades required to acquire them in a single step.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The use of integer division and the way the formula is structured allows for a direct calculation of the number of trades without needing to check for remainders separately, which simplifies the logic and improves readability.\n\n### Reflection on My Approach:\nMy initial approach was more verbose and involved multiple steps, which could lead to potential errors in logic or calculations.
