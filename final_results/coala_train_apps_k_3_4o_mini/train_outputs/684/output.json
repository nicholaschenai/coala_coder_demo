    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The problem involves a game played between two players, you and the Grinch, where you take turns making moves with a number \\( N \\). The moves allowed are either dividing \\( N \\) by any of its odd divisors greater than 1 or subtracting 1 from \\( N \\) if \\( N \\) is greater than 1. The player who cannot make a move loses the game. You start first, and the goal is to determine who will win for multiple test cases.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To determine the winner, we can analyze the game using a strategy based on the value of \\( N \\). If \\( N \\) is 1, the Grinch wins because you cannot make a move. For other values of \\( N \\), we can use a recursive approach to simulate the game. If you can make a move that forces the Grinch into a losing position, you win. We can use memoization to store results for previously computed values of \\( N \\) to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function can_win(N):\n       if N == 1:\n           return False  // Grinch wins\n       if N is already computed:\n           return stored result\n       \n       // Check if subtracting 1 leads to a losing position for Grinch\n       if not can_win(N - 1):\n           store result as True\n           return True\n       \n       // Check all odd divisors greater than 1\n       for each odd divisor d of N:\n           if not can_win(N / d):\n               store result as True\n               return True\n       \n       store result as False\n       return False\n\n   function main():\n       read T\n       for each test case:\n           read N\n           if can_win(N):\n               print \"Me\"\n           else:\n               print \"Grinch\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef can_win(N, memo):\n    # Base case: if N is 1, the current player loses\n    if N == 1:\n        return False\n    # Check if the result for this N is already computed\n    if N in memo:\n        return memo[N]\n    \n    # Check if subtracting 1 leads to a losing position for Grinch\n    if not can_win(N - 1, memo):\n        memo[N] = True\n        return True\n    \n    # Check all odd divisors greater than 1\n    for d in range(3, N + 1, 2):  # Iterate through odd numbers\n        if N % d == 0:  # d is an odd divisor of N\n            if not can_win(N // d, memo):\n                memo[N] = True\n                return True\n    \n    # If no winning move is found, the current player loses\n    memo[N] = False\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N\n        memo = {}  # Dictionary to store computed results\n        if can_win(N, memo):\n            print(\"Me\")  # You win\n        else:\n            print(\"Grinch\")  # Grinch wins\n\nmain()\n```",
