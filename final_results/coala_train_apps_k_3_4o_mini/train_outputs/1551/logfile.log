Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem requires us to classify quotes based on the presence of the word "not". If a quote contains the word "not", it is classified as "Real Fancy". If it does not contain the word "not", it is classified as "regularly fancy". We need to process multiple quotes as input and provide the classification for each.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   We will read the number of quotes (test cases) and then for each quote, we will check if the word "not" is present. To do this, we can split the quote into words and check if "not" is one of those words. Based on this check, we will print "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Read the integer T (number of test cases)
   For each test case from 1 to T:
       Read the quote S
       Split S into words
       If "not" is in the list of words:
           Print "Real Fancy"
       Else:
           Print "regularly fancy"
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
# Function to classify quotes as Real Fancy or regularly fancy
def classify_quotes():
    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    
    # Iterate over each test case

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money (K) to N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money, such that he ends up with exactly zero. The key insights were that if the total demand from all minions exceeds K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and if the total demand equals K, he can distribute the money exactly.

    Initially, I implemented a solution that simply checked if the total demand was greater than, equal to, or less than K. However, this approach failed to account for the scenario where the total demand was less than K but could still be distributed in a way that Gru ends up with zero. The logic needed to ensure that Gru could fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.

    The correct approach involves:
    1. Calculating the total demand.
    2. Checking if the total demand exceeds K (output "NO").
    3. If the total demand equals K, output "YES".
    4. If the total demand is less than K, output "NO" since Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.

    The final code snippet that captures this logic is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, input().split())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
            total_demand = sum(A)
        
            if total_demand > K:
                print("NO")
            elif total_demand == K:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    can_distribute_money(T)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the conditions under which money can be distributed and ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such substring remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate strings and utilize loops for repeated operations. The solution successfully handled multiple test cases by reading input, processing each string, and outputting the final result after all removals.

    The implemented code used a while loop to check for "abc" and the `replace` method to remove it. This method was efficient for the problem's constraints, as it ensured that the string was modified in place until no "abc" substrings were left. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def remove_abc_pairs(test_cases):
        for s in test_cases:
            while "abc" in s:
                s = s.replace("abc", "", 1)
            print(s)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]
    remove_abc_pairs(test_cases)
    ```

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding string operations and iterative processes in programming.

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to construct a pyramid of strings based on a given string \( S \) and answer multiple queries about the occurrences of a smaller string \( T \) within specific rows of the pyramid. The core concepts involved string manipulation, cyclic indexing, and substring counting.

    The solution involved two main functions: one to generate the string for a given row \( N \) by cycling through \( S \), and another to count the occurrences of \( T \) in that generated string. The approach was straightforward, leveraging basic string operations and loops.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. The key takeaway was the importance of efficiently constructing the row string and accurately counting substrings, especially given the constraints where \( N \) could be as large as \( 10^9 \). 

    The code snippet for generating the row string and counting occurrences is as follows:

    ```python
    def get_row_string(S, N):
        length_S = len(S)
        row_string = ""
        for i in range(N):
            row_string += S[i % length_S]
        return row_string

    def count_occurrences(row_string, T):
        count = 0
        length_T = len(T)
        for i in range(len(row_string) - length_T + 1):
            if row_string[i:i + length_T] == T:
                count += 1
        return count
    ```

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding string manipulation techniques and the efficiency of operations when dealing with potentially large inputs.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple quotes, and we need to determine if each quote contains the word "not".
   - The expected output is "Real Fancy" if the quote contains "not" as a standalone word, and "regularly fancy" if it does not.

2. **Identifying the Issue**:
   - The previous solution checks if the substring "not" is present in the quote. However, this does not ensure that "not" is treated as a standalone word. For example, in the quote "nothing", the substring "not" is present, but it should not classify as "Real Fancy".
   - The check should be for the word "not" surrounded by spaces or at the beginning/end of the string.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - I used the `in` operator to check for the presence of "not" without ensuring it is a separate word. This led to incorrect classifications when "not" was part of another word (like "nothing").

### Revised Approach:
To fix the issue, I need to:
- Split the quote into words.
- Check if "not" is one of the words in the list of words from the quote.

### Updated Pseudocode:
```
function classify_quotes():
    read integer T (number of test cases)
    for each test case from 1 to T:
        read string S (the quote)
        split S into words
        if "not" is in the list of words:
            print "Real Fancy"
        else:
            print "regularly fancy"

main:
    call classify_quotes()
```

### Final Python 3 Solution:

def classify_quotes():
    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    # Loop through each test case

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such substring remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate strings and utilize loops for repeated operations. The solution successfully handled multiple test cases by reading input, processing each string, and outputting the final result after all removals.

    The implemented code used a while loop to check for "abc" and the `replace` method to remove it. This method was efficient for the problem's constraints, as it ensured that the string was modified in place until no "abc" substrings were left. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def remove_abc_pairs(test_cases):
        for s in test_cases:
            while "abc" in s:
                s = s.replace("abc", "", 1)
            print(s)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]
    remove_abc_pairs(test_cases)
    ```

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding string operations and iterative processes in programming.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by moving one character from any position in a given string to any other position. The solution required iterating through each character, removing it, and inserting it at every possible position in the remaining string to find the smallest possible arrangement.

    Throughout the attempts, the main issues revolved around correctly handling the input and output formats. Initially, the output was printed directly as strings, which did not match the expected format of a list of dictionaries. The expected output was to be structured as `[{smallest_string}]` for each test case, but the implementation was returning a list of strings instead.

    The final solution involved collecting results in a list and ensuring that the output was printed in the correct format. The key takeaway was the importance of adhering to the specified output format, as it can lead to confusion and failed tests if not followed precisely.

    Here’s the final code snippet that was intended to solve the problem:

    ```python
    def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(test_cases):
        results = []  # To collect results for each test case
        for s in test_cases:
            smallest_string = s
            n = len(s)
        
            for i in range(n):
                char = s[i]
                new_string = s[:i] + s[i+1:]
            
                for j in range(n - 1):
                    candidate_string = new_string[:j] + char + new_string[j:]
                    if candidate_string < smallest_string:
                        smallest_string = candidate_string
        
            results.append({smallest_string})  # Collect the smallest string for the test case in a dictionary

        print(results)  # Print the results as a list of dictionaries

    # Read number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]
    find_lexicographically_smallest_string(test_cases)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly, especially regarding input and output formats, to ensure successful implementation.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money (K) to N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money, such that he ends up with exactly zero. The key insights were that if the total demand from all minions exceeds K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and if the total demand equals K, he can distribute the money exactly.

    Initially, I implemented a solution that simply checked if the total demand was greater than, equal to, or less than K. However, this approach failed to account for the scenario where the total demand was less than K but could still be distributed in a way that Gru ends up with zero. The logic needed to ensure that Gru could fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.

    The correct approach involves:
    1. Calculating the total demand.
    2. Checking if the total demand exceeds K (output "NO").
    3. If the total demand equals K, output "YES".
    4. If the total demand is less than K, output "NO" since Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.

    The final code snippet that captures this logic is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, input().split())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
            total_demand = sum(A)
        
            if total_demand > K:
                print("NO")
            elif total_demand == K:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    can_distribute_money(T)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the conditions under which money can be distributed and ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
"I don't have any fancy quotes." - vijju123
Chef was reading some quotes by great people. Now, he is interested in classifying all the fancy quotes he knows. He thinks that all fancy quotes which contain the word "not" are Real Fancy; quotes that do not contain it are regularly fancy.
You are given some quotes. For each quote, you need to tell Chef if it is Real Fancy or just regularly fancy.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$ denoting a quote.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy" (without quotes).

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 50$
- $1 \le |S| \le 100$
- each character of $S$ is either a lowercase English letter or a space

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to classify quotes based on the presence of the word "not". If a quote contains the word "not", it is classified as "Real Fancy". If it does not contain the word "not", it is classified as "regularly fancy". We need to process multiple quotes and provide the classification for each.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - Read the number of quotes (test cases).
   - For each quote, check if the word "not" is present.
   - If "not" is found, classify the quote as "Real Fancy".
   - If "not" is not found, classify it as "regularly fancy".
   - Print the classification for each quote.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function classify_quotes():
       read integer T (number of test cases)
       for each test case from 1 to T:
           read string S (the quote)
           if "not" is in S:
               print "Real Fancy"
           else:
               print "regularly fancy"

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple quotes, and we need to determine if each quote contains the word "not".
   - The expected output is "Real Fancy" if the quote contains "not" as a standalone word, and "regularly fancy" if it does not.

2. **Identifying the Issue**:
   - The previous solution checks if the substring "not" is present in the quote. However, this does not ensure that "not" is treated as a standalone word. For example, in the quote "nothing", the substring "not" is present, but it should not classify as "Real Fancy".
   - The check should be for the word "not" surrounded by spaces or at the beginning/end of the string.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - I used the `in` operator to check for the presence of "not" without ensuring it is a separate word. This led to incorrect classifications when "not" was part of another word (like "nothing").

### Revised Approach:
To fix the issue, I need to:
- Split the quote into words.
- Check if "not" is one of the words in the list of words from the quote.

### Updated Pseudocode:
```
function classify_quotes():
    read integer T (number of test cases)
    for each test case from 1 to T:
        read string S (the quote)
        split S into words
        if "not" is in the list of words:
            print "Real Fancy"
        else:
            print "regularly fancy"

main:
    call classify_quotes()
```

### Final Python 3 Solution:
```python
def classify_quotes():
    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    # Loop through each test case
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the quote

    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to classify quotes based on the presence of the word "not". Initially, I incorrectly checked for the substring "not" within the quotes, which led to misclassifications when "not" was part of other words (e.g., "nothing"). This highlighted the importance of ensuring that the word is treated as a standalone entity.

The correct approach involved splitting the quote into individual words and checking if "not" was present in that list. This method effectively addressed the problem requirements and ensured accurate classifications. 

The final solution used the following code:

```python
def classify_quotes():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = input().strip()
        words = S.split()
        if "not" in words:

        else:
            print("regularly fancy")

classify_quotes()
```

This experience reinforced the importance of understanding word boundaries in string processing and the need to validate assumptions about input data.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] In reflecting on my attempts to solve the problem, I realized that my initial approach was flawed due to the way I checked for the presence of the word "not". I used the `in` operator directly on the string, which could lead to false positives when "not" was part of another word (e.g., "nothing"). The official solution correctly splits the input string into words using `split(' ')`, which ensures that "not" is treated as a standalone word.

The official solution also employs a simple loop to process each test case, which is efficient and straightforward. It checks for the presence of "not" in the list of words and prints the appropriate classification. This method is effective because it directly addresses the problem requirements without unnecessary complexity.

Key insights from the official solution:
- Use `split()` to break the string into words, ensuring accurate word boundaries.
- Check for the presence of "not" in the resulting list of words.
- Maintain a simple loop structure to handle multiple test cases efficiently.

Overall, the official solution is concise and effectively meets the problem's requirements, while my initial solution failed to account for word boundaries, leading to incorrect classifications. This experience reinforces the importance of carefully considering how to handle string operations in programming challenges.

    For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy" (without quotes).

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le T \le 50$
    - $1 \le |S| \le 100$
    - each character of $S$ is either a lowercase English letter or a space
