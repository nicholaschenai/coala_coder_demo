Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.\n\n\nYou may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.\n\nFurthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].\n\n\nExamples:\n\ns = \"3[a]2[bc]\", return \"aaabcbc\".\ns = \"3[a2[c]]\", return \"accaccacc\".\ns = \"2[abc]3[cd]ef\", return \"abcabccdcdcdef\".\n\nThe output code needs to use the provided function signature\n\nThe final python function should begin with: \n```python\n\nclass Solution:\n    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:\n        \n```\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to decode a string that contains encoded patterns. The encoding format is `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times to repeat the `encoded_string` that follows it inside square brackets. Our task is to return the fully decoded string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To decode the string, we can use a stack to keep track of the characters and numbers as we parse through the string. When we encounter a digit, we build the number until we hit a `[`, at which point we push the number and the current string onto the stack. When we encounter a `]`, we pop from the stack to get the last number and string, repeat the string that many times, and append it to the string we are currently building. This process continues until we have processed the entire input string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Initialize an empty stack\n   Initialize an empty current_string\n   Initialize a number variable to 0\n\n   For each character in the input string:\n       If the character is a digit:\n           Update the number (build the complete number)\n       Else if the character is '[':\n           Push the current_string and the number onto the stack\n           Reset current_string and number\n       Else if the character is ']':\n           Pop the number and the last string from the stack\n           Repeat current_string the number of times and append to the last string\n           Update current_string to this new string\n       Else:\n           Append the character to current_string\n\n   Return current_string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:\n        # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of numbers and strings\n        stack = []\n        current_string = \"\"\n        number = 0\n        \n        # Iterate through each character in the input string\n        for char in s:\n            if char.isdigit():\n                # Build the number (could be more than one digit)\n                number = number * 10 + int(char)\n            elif char == '[':\n                # Push the current string and number onto the stack\n                stack.append((current_string, number))\n                # Reset current_string and number for the new segment\n                current_string = \"\"\n                number = 0\n            elif char == ']':\n                # Pop the last string and number from the stack\n                last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()\n                # Repeat the current_string and append to the last string\n                current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count\n            else:\n                # Append the character to the current_string\n                current_string += char\n        \n        # Return the fully decoded string\n        return current_string\n```"

For example, for \\( K = 3 \\), the output should be:\n           ```\n           101\n           101\n           101\n           ```\n           This means that for each line, we need to alternate between 1s and 0s, starting with 1.\n\n        2. **Identifying the Mistakes**:\n           - The previous implementation incorrectly generated the pattern. Instead of alternating between 1s and 0s, it generated a sequence of numbers that increased and then decreased, which is not what the problem requires.\n           - The output format was also incorrect. Each line should consist of a repeated pattern of \"10\" up to the length specified by \\( K \\).\n\n        3. **Correcting the Logic**:\n           - For each test case with a given \\( K \\):\n             - We need to print \\( K \\) lines.\n             - Each line should consist of the string \"10\" repeated \\( K \\) times, but truncated to \\( K \\) characters.\n           - The output for each test case should be separated by a blank line, except for the last test case.\n\n        4. **Revising the Pseudocode**:\n           ```\n           function print_pattern(T):\n               for each test case in T:\n                   read K\n                   pattern = \"10\" * K  # Create a long enough pattern\n                   for i from 0 to K-1:\n                       print the first K characters of pattern\n                   if not the last test case:\n                       print a blank line\n\n           read T\n           print_pattern(T)\n           ```\n\n        5. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n        ```python\n        def print_pattern(T):\n            # Loop through each test case\n            for t in range(T):\n                K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case\n                pattern = \"10\" * K  # Create a long enough pattern\n                # Print K lines of the pattern\n                for i in range(K):\n                    print(pattern[:K])  # Print the first K characters of the pattern\n                # Print a blank line after each test case except the last one\n                if t < T - 1:\n                    print()\n\n        # Read the number of test cases\n        T = int(input())\n        print_pattern(T)  # Call the function to print the patterns for all test cases\n        ``` \n\n        This revised solution should now correctly generate the desired output for each test case.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Based on the analysis and insights from previous attempts, I will correct the code to ensure it generates the desired pattern according to the specifications.

Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Stack Initialization**: The stack is initialized with a base case of an empty string and a multiplier of 1. This allows for easy concatenation of strings as we decode.\n\n2. **Building Numbers**: Instead of maintaining a separate variable for the current number, the official solution builds the number as a string (`num`) and converts it to an integer only when needed. This is a more efficient way to handle multi-digit numbers.\n\n3. **Handling Brackets**: When encountering an opening bracket `[`, the current string and the number are pushed onto the stack. This allows for nested structures to be handled correctly.\n\n4. **Decoding Logic**: Upon encountering a closing bracket `]`, the solution pops the last string and multiplier from the stack and appends the repeated string to the last string in the stack. This ensures that the most recent context is preserved.\n\n5. **Final Output**: The final decoded string is simply the first element of the stack after processing all characters, which is a clean and straightforward way to retrieve the result.\n\nThe official solution is concise and effectively handles the problem's requirements without unnecessary complexity. My initial approach was similar but could have been improved by directly managing the number as a string and simplifying the stack operations. Overall, the official solution serves as a solid reference for handling similar decoding problems in the future."

        "content": "\n[description]\nThis function decodes a string that contains encoded patterns of the form \"k[string]\", where \"k\" is a positive integer indicating how many times the \"string\" should be repeated. It uses a stack to keep track of the current string and the number of repetitions as it processes each character in the input. When a digit is encountered, it builds the current number, and when an opening bracket is found, it saves the current string and number onto the stack. Upon encountering a closing bracket, it pops the last string and repeat count from the stack, repeats the current string accordingly, and appends it to the last string. Regular characters are simply added to the current string being built. Finally, the fully decoded string is returned.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to decode strings that follow a specific encoding pattern, such as in data compression, parsing encoded messages, or handling input formats in programming contests. It can also be applied in situations where you need to manipulate strings based on certain rules, such as in text processing applications or when implementing custom serialization/deserialization logic."
