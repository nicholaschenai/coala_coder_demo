- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.


The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.


You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].


Examples:

s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        
```

2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to decode a string that contains encoded patterns. The encoding format is `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times to repeat the `encoded_string` that follows it inside square brackets. Our task is to return the fully decoded string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To decode the string, we can use a stack to keep track of the characters and numbers as we parse through the string. When we encounter a digit, we build the number until we hit a `[`, at which point we push the number and the current string onto the stack. When we encounter a `]`, we pop from the stack to get the last number and string, repeat the string that many times, and append it to the string we are currently building. This process continues until we have processed the entire input string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize an empty stack
   Initialize an empty current_string
   Initialize a number variable to 0

   For each character in the input string:
       If the character is a digit:
           Update the number (build the complete number)
       Else if the character is '[':
           Push the current_string and the number onto the stack
           Reset current_string and number
       Else if the character is ']':
           Pop the number and the last string from the stack
           Repeat current_string the number of times and append to the last string
           Update current_string to this new string
       Else:
           Append the character to current_string

   Return current_string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of numbers and strings

        for char in s:
            if char.isdigit():
                # Build the number (could be more than one digit)
                number = number * 10 + int(char)
            elif char == '[':
                # Push the current string and number onto the stack
                stack.append((current_string, number))
                # Reset current_string and number for the new segment
                current_string = ""
                number = 0
            elif char == ']':
                # Pop the last string and number from the stack
                last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()
                # Repeat the current_string and append to the last string
                current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count
            else:
                # Append the character to the current_string
                current_string += char

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
           The task is to generate a specific pattern based on an integer input \( K \). For each test case, we need to print a pattern of numbers that starts from 0 and goes up to \( K-1 \) in a specific arrangement. The output for each test case should consist of \( K \) lines, where each line contains a sequence of numbers that decreases from the current line number down to 0, and then increases back up to the current line number.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           - Read the number of test cases \( T \).
           - For each test case, read the integer \( K \).
           - For each integer \( K \), generate \( K \) lines of output.
           - For each line \( i \) (where \( i \) ranges from 0 to \( K-1 \)):
             - Print numbers starting from 0 up to \( i \) (inclusive).
             - Then print numbers starting from \( i-1 \) down to 0 (inclusive).
           - Print the results for each test case.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function print_pattern(T):
               for each test case in T:
                   read K
                   for i from 0 to K-1:
                       line = []
                       for j from 0 to i:
                           append j to line
                       for j from i-1 down to 0:
                           append j to line
                       print line as a string

    [Task]:
        The chef is trying to decode some pattern problems, Chef wants your help to code it. Chef has one number K to form a new pattern. Help the chef to code this pattern problem.

        -----Input:-----
        - First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
        - Each test case contains a single line of input, one integer $K$. 

        -----Output:-----
        For each test case, output as the pattern.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \leq T \leq 100$
        - $1 \leq K \leq 100$

        -----Sample Input:-----
        4
        1
        2
        3
        4

        -----Sample Output:-----
        1
        10
        10
        101
        101
        101
        1010
        1010
        1010
        1010

        -----EXPLANATION:-----
        No need, else pattern can be decode easily.
    [/Task]

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

        1. **Understanding the Expected Output**:
           The expected output for each test case is a specific pattern of numbers. For example, for \( K = 3 \), the output should be:
           ```
           101
           101
           101
           ```
           This means that for each line, we need to alternate between 1s and 0s, starting with 1.

        2. **Identifying the Mistakes**:
           - The previous implementation incorrectly generated the pattern. Instead of alternating between 1s and 0s, it generated a sequence of numbers that increased and then decreased, which is not what the problem requires.
           - The output format was also incorrect. Each line should consist of a repeated pattern of "10" up to the length specified by \( K \).

        3. **Correcting the Logic**:
           - For each test case with a given \( K \):
             - We need to print \( K \) lines.
             - Each line should consist of the string "10" repeated \( K \) times, but truncated to \( K \) characters.
           - The output for each test case should be separated by a blank line, except for the last test case.

        4. **Revising the Pseudocode**:
           ```
           function print_pattern(T):
               for each test case in T:
                   read K
                   pattern = "10" * K  # Create a long enough pattern
                   for i from 0 to K-1:
                       print the first K characters of pattern
                   if not the last test case:
                       print a blank line

           read T
           print_pattern(T)
           ```

        5. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
        ```python
        def print_pattern(T):
            # Loop through each test case
            for t in range(T):
                K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case
                pattern = "10" * K  # Create a long enough pattern
                # Print K lines of the pattern
                for i in range(K):
                    print(pattern[:K])  # Print the first K characters of the pattern
                # Print a blank line after each test case except the last one
                if t < T - 1:
                    print()

        # Read the number of test cases
        T = int(input())
        print_pattern(T)  # Call the function to print the patterns for all test cases
        ``` 

        This revised solution should now correctly generate the desired output for each test case.
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Based on the analysis and insights from previous attempts, I will correct the code to ensure it generates the desired pattern according to the specifications. The key points to address are:

        1. Each test case should print \( K \) lines.
        2. Each line \( i \) should consist of numbers starting from 0 up to \( i \) and then back down to 0.
        3. The output for each test case should be printed consecutively without any extra blank lines in between.

        Here is the corrected Python code:

        ```python
        def print_pattern(T):
            # Loop through each test case
            for t in range(T):
                K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case
                # Loop to generate each line of the pattern
                for i in range(K):
                    line = []  # Initialize an empty list to hold the current line's numbers
                    # Append numbers from 0 to i
                    for j in range(i + 1):
                        line.append(str(j))
                    # Append numbers from i-1 down to 0
                    for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
                        line.append(str(j))
                    # Print the current line as a string
                    print(''.join(line))

        # Read the number of test cases
        T = int(input())
        print_pattern(T)  # Call the function to print the patterns for all test cases
        ```

        ### Key Changes Made:
        - The logic for generating the pattern remains intact.
        - The output is printed directly without any additional formatting or blank lines between test cases.

        This code should now correctly generate the desired output format for each test case as specified in the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to decode a string that follows a specific encoding format. The format is `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer that indicates how many times the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets should be repeated. The goal is to return the fully decoded string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - We need to iterate through the input string character by character.
   - When we encounter a digit, we need to determine the full number (which could be more than one digit).
   - When we encounter an opening bracket `[`, we need to push the current number and the current decoded string onto a stack.
   - When we encounter a closing bracket `]`, we pop from the stack to get the last number and the last decoded string, then repeat the current decoded string that many times and append it to the last decoded string.
   - Finally, we return the fully decoded string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function decodeString(s):
       stack = []  # Initialize a stack to keep track of numbers and strings
       current_num = 0  # To build the current number
       current_string = ""  # To build the current decoded string

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.


The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.


You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].


Examples:

s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] The task involved decoding a string formatted as `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times the `encoded_string` should be repeated. The solution required iterating through the string, handling digits to form numbers, and using a stack to manage nested structures created by brackets.

Key concepts included:
- Building numbers from digits, which could be more than one digit long.
- Using a stack to keep track of the current string and repeat counts when encountering opening brackets.
- Repeating the current string and appending it to the last string when encountering closing brackets.

The implemented solution effectively handled these requirements by maintaining a `current_string` and `current_num`, and using a stack to manage nested encodings. The final code successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was sound and efficient.

The final code snippet is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        current_num = 0
        current_string = ""

        for char in s:
            if char.isdigit():
                current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)
            elif char == '[':
                stack.append((current_string, current_num))
                current_string = ""
                current_num = 0
            elif char == ']':
                last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()
                current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count
            else:
                current_string += char

        return current_string
```

This experience reinforced the importance of using stacks for managing nested structures and highlighted the need to carefully handle string and number manipulations in such encoding problems.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.


The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.


You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].


Examples:

s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        
```

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 146 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to decode a string that follows a specific encoding format. The format is `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer that indicates how many times the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets should be repeated. The goal is to return the fully decoded string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - We need to iterate through the input string character by character.
   - When we encounter a digit, we need to determine the full number (which could be more than one digit).
   - When we encounter an opening bracket `[`, we need to push the current number and the current decoded string onto a stack.
   - When we encounter a closing bracket `]`, we pop from the stack to get the last number and the last decoded string, then repeat the current decoded string that many times and append it to the last decoded string.
   - Finally, we return the fully decoded string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function decodeString(s):
       stack = []  # Initialize a stack to keep track of numbers and strings
       current_num = 0  # To build the current number
       current_string = ""  # To build the current decoded string

       for char in s:
           if char is a digit:
               current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)  # Build the number
           elif char is '[':
               stack.append((current_string, current_num))  # Push current string and number onto stack
               current_string = ""  # Reset current string
               current_num = 0  # Reset current number
           elif char is ']':
               last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()  # Pop from stack
               current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count  # Repeat the string
           else:
               current_string += char  # Append the character to the current string

       return current_string  # Return the fully decoded string
   ```

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] The official solution effectively utilizes a stack to manage the decoding process, which is a common approach for problems involving nested structures like brackets. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Stack Initialization**: The stack is initialized with a base case of an empty string and a multiplier of 1. This allows for easy concatenation of strings as we decode.

2. **Building Numbers**: Instead of maintaining a separate variable for the current number, the official solution builds the number as a string (`num`) and converts it to an integer only when needed. This is a more efficient way to handle multi-digit numbers.

3. **Handling Brackets**: When encountering an opening bracket `[`, the current string and the number are pushed onto the stack. This allows for nested structures to be handled correctly.

4. **Decoding Logic**: Upon encountering a closing bracket `]`, the solution pops the last string and multiplier from the stack and appends the repeated string to the last string in the stack. This ensures that the most recent context is preserved.

5. **Final Output**: The final decoded string is simply the first element of the stack after processing all characters, which is a clean and straightforward way to retrieve the result.

The official solution is concise and effectively handles the problem's requirements without unnecessary complexity. My initial approach was similar but could have been improved by directly managing the number as a string and simplifying the stack operations. Overall, the official solution serves as a solid reference for handling similar decoding problems in the future.

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] This function decodes a string that contains encoded patterns of the form "k[string]", where "k" is a positive integer indicating how many times the "string" should be repeated. It uses a stack to keep track of the current string and the number of repetitions as it processes each character in the input. When a digit is encountered, it builds the current number, and when an opening bracket is found, it saves the current string and number onto the stack. Upon encountering a closing bracket, it pops the last string and repeat count from the stack, repeats the current string accordingly, and appends it to the last string. Regular characters are simply added to the current string being built. Finally, the fully decoded string is returned.
