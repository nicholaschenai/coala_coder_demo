    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The task is to decode a string that follows a specific encoding format. The format is `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer that indicates how many times the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets should be repeated. The goal is to return the fully decoded string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   - We need to iterate through the input string character by character.\n   - When we encounter a digit, we need to determine the full number (which could be more than one digit).\n   - When we encounter an opening bracket `[`, we need to push the current number and the current decoded string onto a stack.\n   - When we encounter a closing bracket `]`, we pop from the stack to get the last number and the last decoded string, then repeat the current decoded string that many times and append it to the last decoded string.\n   - Finally, we return the fully decoded string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function decodeString(s):\n       stack = []  # Initialize a stack to keep track of numbers and strings\n       current_num = 0  # To build the current number\n       current_string = \"\"  # To build the current decoded string\n\n       for char in s:\n           if char is a digit:\n               current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)  # Build the number\n           elif char is '[':\n               stack.append((current_string, current_num))  # Push current string and number onto stack\n               current_string = \"\"  # Reset current string\n               current_num = 0  # Reset current number\n           elif char is ']':\n               last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()  # Pop from stack\n               current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count  # Repeat the string\n           else:\n               current_string += char  # Append the character to the current string\n\n       return current_string  # Return the fully decoded string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:\n        # Initialize a stack to keep track of numbers and strings\n        stack = []\n        current_num = 0  # To build the current number\n        current_string = \"\"  # To build the current decoded string\n\n        # Iterate through each character in the input string\n        for char in s:\n            if char.isdigit():  # Check if the character is a digit\n                current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)  # Build the number\n            elif char == '[':  # Check for opening bracket\n                # Push the current string and number onto the stack\n                stack.append((current_string, current_num))\n                current_string = \"\"  # Reset current string\n                current_num = 0  # Reset current number\n            elif char == ']':  # Check for closing bracket\n                # Pop from the stack to get the last string and repeat count\n                last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()\n                # Repeat the current string and append to the last string\n                current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count\n            else:  # If it's a regular character\n                current_string += char  # Append the character to the current string\n\n        return current_string  # Return the fully decoded string\n```",
