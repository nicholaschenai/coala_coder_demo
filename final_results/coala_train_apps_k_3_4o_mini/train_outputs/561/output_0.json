    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   We need to determine if Gru can distribute his money to a number of minions such that he spends exactly all the money he has. Each minion demands a certain amount of money, and Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount they demand is less than or equal to the amount Gru has left.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   For each test case, we will sum up the total amount of money demanded by all minions. If this total is equal to the amount of money Gru has, then he can distribute the money exactly as needed, and we will output \"YES\". If the total is less than or greater than the amount Gru has, we will output \"NO\".\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function can_distribute_money(T):\n       for each test case:\n           read N and K\n           read the list of demands A\n           total_demand = sum(A)\n           \n           if total_demand == K:\n               print \"YES\"\n           else:\n               print \"NO\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef can_distribute_money(T):\n    # Iterate through each test case\n    for _ in range(T):\n        # Read the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        # Read the demands of each minion\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions\n        total_demand = sum(A)\n        \n        # Check if the total demand is equal to the money Gru has\n        if total_demand == K:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\n# Call the function to process the test cases\ncan_distribute_money(T)\n``` \n\nThis code reads the number of test cases, processes each case by reading the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has, calculates the total demand, and checks if it matches Gru's available money, printing \"YES\" or \"NO\" accordingly.",
