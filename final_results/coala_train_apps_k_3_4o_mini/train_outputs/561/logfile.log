## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
This time minions are celebrating Diwali Festival. There are N minions in total. Each of them owns a house. On this Festival, Each of them wants to decorate their house. But none of them have enough money to do that. One of the minion, Kevin, requested Gru for money. Gru agreed for money distribution but he will be giving money to a minion if and only if demanded money is less than or equal to the money Gru have. Now Gru wonders if he can spend all the money or not.

-----Input-----
First line have number of test cases T. Each test case consist of Two Lines. First line contains two space separated integers N and K i.e. Number of minions and Amount of Money Gru have. Next line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,A3,.....,AN representing amount of money demanded by ith minion.

-----Output-----
Output YES if Gru can spend his all of the money on minions i.e. after distribution Gru have zero amount of money else NO.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 102
- 1 â‰¤ K,Ai â‰¤ 109

-----Example-----
Input:
2 
4 9
5 2 2 4
4 9
5 2 18 3

Output:
YES
NO


-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to first minion then remaining 4 Rs. can be given to 2nd and 3rd minion or to the 4th minion. Which will leave zero amount of money in the hands of Gru.
Example case 2.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to the first minion then from remaining 4 Rs. either he can give 2 Rs. to the 2nd minion or 3 Rs. to the fourth minion. Which will leave either 2 Rs. or 1 Rs. in the hands of Gru.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a number of test cases where each test case consists of a number of minions and the total amount of money Gru has. Each minion demands a certain amount of money to decorate their house. Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount they demand is less than or equal to the money he has. The goal is to determine if Gru can distribute all of his money exactly to the minions without any leftover.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   For each test case, we need to check if the total amount of money demanded by all minions is equal to the amount of money Gru has. If the sum of the demands is equal to Gru's total money, then he can distribute it all without any leftover. If the sum is less than or greater than Gru's money, then it is not possible to distribute it exactly.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Read the number of test cases T
   For each test case:
       Read N (number of minions) and K (amount of money Gru has)
       Read the list of demands from the minions
       Calculate the total demand by summing the list of demands
       If total demand equals K:
           Print "YES"
       Else:
           Print "NO"
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def can_gru_spend_all_money():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
    results = []
    
    index = 1
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and K
        demands = list(map(int, data[index + 1].split()))  # Read demands
        total_demand = sum(demands)  # Calculate total demand
        
        # Check if total demand equals the money Gru has
        if total_demand == K:
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
        
        index += 2  # Move to the next test case
    
    # Print all results for each test case
    print("\n".join(results))

# The function can_gru_spend_all_money will be called to execute the solution.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element by its index any number of times. The key insight was that the total sum of the sequence must be less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, and it must also be non-negative to reach zero.

    Initially, the solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it could always be made zero. This was a flawed assumption because it did not account for the possibility of the total sum being negative, which would make it impossible to reach zero.

    The corrected approach involved:
    1. Calculating the total sum of the sequence.
    2. Calculating the maximum reduction possible using the formula for the sum of the first `N` natural numbers.
    3. Checking both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction and must be non-negative.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
            total_sum = sum(A)
            max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))
        
            if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    can_make_good_sequence(T)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all conditions that affect the outcome, especially when dealing with sums and reductions.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
           We need to determine if we can modify a sequence of integers such that the sum of all its elements becomes zero. The modification allowed is to decrease any element at index `i` by `i` any number of times.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           To solve this problem, we can calculate the total sum of the sequence. If the sum is already zero, we can immediately return "YES". If the sum is positive, we need to check if we can reduce it to zero by using the allowed operations. Each element can be decreased by its index, which means we can reduce the total sum by a maximum of `i` for each element at index `i`. We can calculate the maximum possible reduction and see if it is sufficient to bring the total sum to zero.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function can_make_good_sequence(T):
               for each test case:
                   read N
                   read array A
                   total_sum = sum(A)
                   max_reduction = sum of indices from 1 to N (which is N * (N + 1) / 2)
           
                   if total_sum <= max_reduction:
                       print "YES"
                   else:
                       print "NO"

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

        1. **Understanding the Problem**:
           We need to determine if we can make the sum of a sequence of integers equal to zero by performing operations that allow us to decrease each element `A[i]` by its index `i` any number of times.

        2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
           The previous solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum of the sequence is less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, we can always achieve a sum of zero. However, this is not necessarily true. The operations we can perform are limited by the indices, and we need to ensure that we can actually reach zero from the current sum, considering the specific values of the elements.

        3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
           - The logic to check if `total_sum <= max_reduction` is not sufficient. We need to consider the actual values of the elements and how much we can reduce each one based on its index.
           - We should also consider the case where the total sum is negative. If the sum is negative, we cannot make it zero since we can only decrease the values.

        4. **Revised Approach**:
           - Calculate the total sum of the sequence.
           - Calculate the maximum reduction possible.
           - If the total sum is positive, check if it can be reduced to zero using the maximum reduction.
           - If the total sum is negative, we cannot make it zero, so the answer should be "NO".

        Now, let's implement the corrected logic in the code.

        ```python
        def can_make_good_sequence(T):
            # Iterate through each test case

        In this revised code, we ensure that we check both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction, and it must also be non-negative to be able to reach zero.
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will correct the solution to ensure it accurately determines whether the sequence can be made good (i.e., the sum can be made zero) by applying the allowed operations.

        Hereâ€™s the revised code:

        ```python
        def can_make_good_sequence(T):
            # Iterate through each test case
            for _ in range(T):
                # Read the number of elements in the sequence
                N = int(input())
                # Read the sequence of integers
                A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
                # Calculate the total sum of the sequence
                total_sum = sum(A)
        
                # Calculate the maximum possible reduction
                max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))  # This is the same as N * (N + 1) // 2
        
                # Check if we can make the sequence good
                # We can only reduce the total sum, so if total_sum is negative, we cannot make it zero
                if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:
                    print("YES")
                else:
                    print("NO")

        # Read the number of test cases
        T = int(input())
        # Call the function to process the test cases
        can_make_good_sequence(T)
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code:
        1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of elements and the sequence itself.
        2. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the total sum of the sequence.
        3. **Maximum Reduction Calculation**: It computes the maximum reduction possible, which is the sum of the first `N` natural numbers (i.e., `1 + 2 + ... + N`).
        4. **Condition Check**: It checks if the total sum can be reduced to zero:
           - The total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction.
           - The total sum must also be non-negative, as we cannot increase the sum.
        5. **Output**: It prints "YES" if the sequence can be made good, otherwise "NO".

        This code should now correctly handle the problem as specified.

   We need to determine if Gru can distribute his money to a number of minions such that he spends exactly all the money he has. Each minion demands a certain amount of money, and Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount they demand is less than or equal to the amount Gru has left.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   For each test case, we will sum up the total amount of money demanded by all minions. If this total is equal to the amount of money Gru has, then he can distribute the money exactly as needed, and we will output "YES". If the total is less than or greater than the amount Gru has, we will output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
This time minions are celebrating Diwali Festival. There are N minions in total. Each of them owns a house. On this Festival, Each of them wants to decorate their house. But none of them have enough money to do that. One of the minion, Kevin, requested Gru for money. Gru agreed for money distribution but he will be giving money to a minion if and only if demanded money is less than or equal to the money Gru have. Now Gru wonders if he can spend all the money or not.

-----Input-----
First line have number of test cases T. Each test case consist of Two Lines. First line contains two space separated integers N and K i.e. Number of minions and Amount of Money Gru have. Next line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,A3,.....,AN representing amount of money demanded by ith minion.

-----Output-----
Output YES if Gru can spend his all of the money on minions i.e. after distribution Gru have zero amount of money else NO.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 102
- 1 â‰¤ K,Ai â‰¤ 109

-----Example-----
Input:
2 
4 9
5 2 2 4
4 9
5 2 18 3

Output:
YES
NO


-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to first minion then remaining 4 Rs. can be given to 2nd and 3rd minion or to the 4th minion. Which will leave zero amount of money in the hands of Gru.
Example case 2.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to the first minion then from remaining 4 Rs. either he can give 2 Rs. to the 2nd minion or 3 Rs. to the fourth minion. Which will leave either 2 Rs. or 1 Rs. in the hands of Gru.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Gru has a certain amount of money (K) and there are N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money.
   - The goal is to determine if Gru can distribute exactly K amount of money to the minions based on their demands.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The initial solution simply checks if the total demand from all minions equals K. However, this does not account for the fact that Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount they demand is less than or equal to the amount he has at that moment.
   - The solution should also ensure that Gru can distribute the money in such a way that he ends up with exactly zero after fulfilling the demands.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The code only checks if the sum of demands equals K, but it does not consider the individual demands and whether they can be satisfied sequentially without exceeding the available amount of money at any point.
   - The logic should involve checking if Gru can fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.

4. **Revising the Approach**:
   - We need to check if the total demand is less than or equal to K, and also ensure that the distribution can be done in a way that Gru can satisfy each minion's demand without exceeding his available money at any point.

### Revised Plan:
1. For each test case, read N and K.
2. Read the list of demands.
3. Calculate the total demand.
4. If the total demand is greater than K, output "NO".
5. If the total demand is less than or equal to K, check if Gru can satisfy each demand in a way that he does not run out of money.

### Updated Code:
```python
def can_distribute_money(T):
    # Iterate through each test case
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the demands of each minion
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions
        total_demand = sum(A)
        
        # Check if the total demand is greater than K
        if total_demand > K:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # If total demand is less than or equal to K, check if we can distribute it
        current_money = K
        possible = True
        
        for demand in A:
            if demand <= current_money:
                current_money -= demand
            else:
                possible = False
                break
        
        if possible and current_money == 0:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
# Call the function to process the test cases
can_distribute_money(T)
```

This updated code checks if Gru can distribute the money correctly by ensuring that he does not run out of money while fulfilling each minion's demand. It also checks if he ends up with exactly zero after all distributions.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
This time minions are celebrating Diwali Festival. There are N minions in total. Each of them owns a house. On this Festival, Each of them wants to decorate their house. But none of them have enough money to do that. One of the minion, Kevin, requested Gru for money. Gru agreed for money distribution but he will be giving money to a minion if and only if demanded money is less than or equal to the money Gru have. Now Gru wonders if he can spend all the money or not.

-----Input-----
First line have number of test cases T. Each test case consist of Two Lines. First line contains two space separated integers N and K i.e. Number of minions and Amount of Money Gru have. Next line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,A3,.....,AN representing amount of money demanded by ith minion.

-----Output-----
Output YES if Gru can spend his all of the money on minions i.e. after distribution Gru have zero amount of money else NO.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 102
- 1 â‰¤ K,Ai â‰¤ 109

-----Example-----
Input:
2 
4 9
5 2 2 4
4 9
5 2 18 3

Output:
YES
NO


-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to first minion then remaining 4 Rs. can be given to 2nd and 3rd minion or to the 4th minion. Which will leave zero amount of money in the hands of Gru.
Example case 2.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to the first minion then from remaining 4 Rs. either he can give 2 Rs. to the 2nd minion or 3 Rs. to the fourth minion. Which will leave either 2 Rs. or 1 Rs. in the hands of Gru.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine if Gru can distribute his money to a number of minions such that he spends exactly all the money he has. Each minion demands a certain amount of money, and Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount they demand is less than or equal to the amount Gru has left.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   For each test case, we will sum up the total amount of money demanded by all minions. If this total is equal to the amount of money Gru has, then he can distribute the money exactly as needed, and we will output "YES". If the total is less than or greater than the amount Gru has, we will output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_distribute_money(T):
       for each test case:
           read N and K
           read the list of demands A
           total_demand = sum(A)
           
           if total_demand == K:
               print "YES"
           else:
               print "NO"
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def can_distribute_money(T):
    # Iterate through each test case
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the demands of each minion
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions
        total_demand = sum(A)
        
        # Check if the total demand is equal to the money Gru has
        if total_demand == K:
            print("YES")

            print("NO")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
# Call the function to process the test cases
can_distribute_money(T)
``` 

This code reads the number of test cases, processes each case by reading the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has, calculates the total demand, and checks if it matches Gru's available money, printing "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Gru has a certain amount of money (K) and there are N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money.
   - The goal is to determine if Gru can distribute exactly K amount of money to the minions based on their demands.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The initial solution simply checks if the total demand from all minions equals K. However, this does not account for the fact that Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount they demand is less than or equal to the amount he has at that moment.
   - The solution should also ensure that Gru can distribute the money in such a way that he ends up with exactly zero after fulfilling the demands.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The code only checks if the sum of demands equals K, but it does not consider the individual demands and whether they can be satisfied sequentially without exceeding the available amount of money at any point.
   - The logic should involve checking if Gru can fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.

4. **Revising the Approach**:
   - We need to check if the total demand is less than or equal to K, and also ensure that the distribution can be done in a way that Gru can satisfy each minion's demand without exceeding his available money at any point.

### Revised Plan:
1. For each test case, read N and K.
2. Read the list of demands.
3. Calculate the total demand.
4. If the total demand is greater than K, output "NO".
5. If the total demand is less than or equal to K, check if Gru can satisfy each demand in a way that he does not run out of money.

### Updated Code:
```python
def can_distribute_money(T):
    # Iterate through each test case
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the demands of each minion
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions
        total_demand = sum(A)
        
        # Check if the total demand is greater than K
        if total_demand > K:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # If total demand is less than or equal to K, check if we can distribute it
        current_money = K
        possible = True
        
        for demand in A:
            if demand <= current_money:
                current_money -= demand
            else:
                possible = False
                break
        
        if possible and current_money == 0:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
# Call the function to process the test cases
can_distribute_money(T)
```

This updated code checks if Gru can distribute the money correctly by ensuring that he does not run out of money while fulfilling each minion's demand. It also checks if he ends up with exactly zero after all distributions.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element by its index any number of times. The key insight was that the total sum of the sequence must be less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, and it must also be non-negative to reach zero.

    Initially, the solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it could always be made zero. This was a flawed assumption because it did not account for the possibility of the total sum being negative, which would make it impossible to reach zero.

    The corrected approach involved:
    1. Calculating the total sum of the sequence.
    2. Calculating the maximum reduction possible using the formula for the sum of the first `N` natural numbers.
    3. Checking both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction and must be non-negative.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
            total_sum = sum(A)
            max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))
        
            if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    can_make_good_sequence(T)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all conditions that affect the outcome, especially when dealing with sums and reductions.

    [Task]:
        Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is $0$.
        You have a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. You may perform any number of operations on this sequence (including zero). In one operation, you should choose a valid index $i$ and decrease $A_i$ by $i$. Can you make the sequence good using these operations?

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
        - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
        - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

        -----Output-----

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

        1. **Understanding the Problem**:
           We need to determine if we can make the sum of a sequence of integers equal to zero by performing operations that allow us to decrease each element `A[i]` by its index `i` any number of times.

        2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
           The previous solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum of the sequence is less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, we can always achieve a sum of zero. However, this is not necessarily true. The operations we can perform are limited by the indices, and we need to ensure that we can actually reach zero from the current sum, considering the specific values of the elements.

        3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
           - The logic to check if `total_sum <= max_reduction` is not sufficient. We need to consider the actual values of the elements and how much we can reduce each one based on its index.
           - We should also consider the case where the total sum is negative. If the sum is negative, we cannot make it zero since we can only decrease the values.

        4. **Revised Approach**:
           - Calculate the total sum of the sequence.
           - Calculate the maximum reduction possible.
           - If the total sum is positive, check if it can be reduced to zero using the maximum reduction.
           - If the total sum is negative, we cannot make it zero, so the answer should be "NO".

        Now, let's implement the corrected logic in the code.

        ```python
        def can_make_good_sequence(T):
            # Iterate through each test case
            for _ in range(T):
                # Read the number of elements in the sequence
                N = int(input())
                # Read the sequence of integers
                A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
                # Calculate the total sum of the sequence
                total_sum = sum(A)
        
                # Calculate the maximum possible reduction
                max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))  # This is the same as N * (N + 1) // 2
        
                # Check if we can make the sequence good
                if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:
                    print("YES")
                else:
                    print("NO")

        # Read the number of test cases
        T = int(input())
        # Call the function to process the test cases
        can_make_good_sequence(T)
        ``` 

        In this revised code, we ensure that we check both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction, and it must also be non-negative to be able to reach zero.
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will correct the solution to ensure it accurately determines whether the sequence can be made good (i.e., the sum can be made zero) by applying the allowed operations.

        Hereâ€™s the revised code:

        ```python
        def can_make_good_sequence(T):
            # Iterate through each test case
            for _ in range(T):
                # Read the number of elements in the sequence
                N = int(input())
                # Read the sequence of integers
                A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
                # Calculate the total sum of the sequence
                total_sum = sum(A)
        
                # Calculate the maximum possible reduction
                max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))  # This is the same as N * (N + 1) // 2
        
                # Check if we can make the sequence good
                # We can only reduce the total sum, so if total_sum is negative, we cannot make it zero
                if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:
                    print("YES")
                else:
                    print("NO")

        # Read the number of test cases
        T = int(input())
        # Call the function to process the test cases
        can_make_good_sequence(T)
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code:
        1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of elements and the sequence itself.
        2. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the total sum of the sequence.
        3. **Maximum Reduction Calculation**: It computes the maximum reduction possible, which is the sum of the first `N` natural numbers (i.e., `1 + 2 + ... + N`).
        4. **Condition Check**: It checks if the total sum can be reduced to zero:
           - The total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction.
           - The total sum must also be non-negative, as we cannot increase the sum.
        5. **Output**: It prints "YES" if the sequence can be made good, otherwise "NO".

        This code should now correctly handle the problem as specified.

        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
           We need to determine if we can modify a sequence of integers such that the sum of all its elements becomes zero. The modification allowed is to decrease any element at index `i` by `i` any number of times.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           To solve this problem, we can calculate the total sum of the sequence. If the sum is already zero, we can immediately return "YES". If the sum is positive, we need to check if we can reduce it to zero by using the allowed operations. Each element can be decreased by its index, which means we can reduce the total sum by a maximum of `i` for each element at index `i`. We can calculate the maximum possible reduction and see if it is sufficient to bring the total sum to zero.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [generation text] Based on the insights and analysis from previous attempts, I will revise the solution to ensure it accurately determines whether Gru can distribute his money to the minions such that he spends exactly all the money he has.

### Revised Approach:
1. For each test case, read the number of minions (N) and the amount of money Gru has (K).
2. Read the list of demands from the minions.
3. Calculate the total demand from all minions.
4. If the total demand is greater than K, output "NO" because Gru cannot fulfill all demands.
5. If the total demand is less than or equal to K, check if Gru can distribute the money in such a way that he ends up with exactly zero after fulfilling the demands.

### Updated Code:
```python
def can_distribute_money(T):
    # Iterate through each test case
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the demands of each minion
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions
        total_demand = sum(A)
        
        # Check if the total demand is greater than K
        if total_demand > K:

        # If total demand is less than or equal to K, check if we can distribute it
        current_money = K
        
        # Sort the demands to try to fulfill the smallest demands first
        A.sort()
        
        possible = True
        
        for demand in A:
            if demand <= current_money:
                current_money -= demand
            else:
                possible = False
                break
        
        # Check if Gru has exactly zero money left after distribution
        if possible and current_money == 0:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
# Call the function to process the test cases
can_distribute_money(T)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has.
2. **Demand Calculation**: It calculates the total demand from all minions.
3. **Demand Check**: If the total demand exceeds the amount of money Gru has, it prints "NO".
4. **Distribution Logic**: It sorts the demands and attempts to fulfill them in ascending order, checking if Gru can satisfy each demand without running out of money.
5. **Final Check**: It checks if Gru has exactly zero money left after fulfilling the demands and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

This code should now correctly handle the problem as specified.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
This time minions are celebrating Diwali Festival. There are N minions in total. Each of them owns a house. On this Festival, Each of them wants to decorate their house. But none of them have enough money to do that. One of the minion, Kevin, requested Gru for money. Gru agreed for money distribution but he will be giving money to a minion if and only if demanded money is less than or equal to the money Gru have. Now Gru wonders if he can spend all the money or not.

-----Input-----
First line have number of test cases T. Each test case consist of Two Lines. First line contains two space separated integers N and K i.e. Number of minions and Amount of Money Gru have. Next line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,A3,.....,AN representing amount of money demanded by ith minion.

-----Output-----
Output YES if Gru can spend his all of the money on minions i.e. after distribution Gru have zero amount of money else NO.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 102
- 1 â‰¤ K,Ai â‰¤ 109

-----Example-----
Input:
2 
4 9
5 2 2 4
4 9
5 2 18 3

Output:
YES
NO


-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to first minion then remaining 4 Rs. can be given to 2nd and 3rd minion or to the 4th minion. Which will leave zero amount of money in the hands of Gru.
Example case 2.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to the first minion then from remaining 4 Rs. either he can give 2 Rs. to the 2nd minion or 3 Rs. to the fourth minion. Which will leave either 2 Rs. or 1 Rs. in the hands of Gru.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine if Gru can distribute his money to a number of minions such that he spends exactly all the money he has. Each minion demands a certain amount of money, and Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount they demand is less than or equal to the amount Gru has left.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   For each test case, we will sum up the total amount of money demanded by all minions. If this total is equal to the amount of money Gru has, then he can distribute the money exactly as needed, and we will output "YES". If the total is less than or greater than the amount Gru has, we will output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_distribute_money(T):
       for each test case:
           read N and K
           read the list of demands A
           total_demand = sum(A)
           
           if total_demand == K:
               print "YES"
           else:
               print "NO"
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def can_distribute_money(T):
    # Iterate through each test case
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the demands of each minion
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions
        total_demand = sum(A)
        
        # Check if the total demand is equal to the money Gru has
        if total_demand == K:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
# Call the function to process the test cases
can_distribute_money(T)
``` 

This code reads the number of test cases, processes each case by reading the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has, calculates the total demand, and checks if it matches Gru's available money, printing "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Gru has a certain amount of money (K) and there are N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money.
   - The goal is to determine if Gru can distribute exactly K amount of money to the minions based on their demands.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The initial solution simply checks if the total demand from all minions equals K. However, this does not account for the fact that Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount they demand is less than or equal to the amount he has at that moment.
   - The solution should also ensure that Gru can distribute the money in such a way that he ends up with exactly zero after fulfilling the demands.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The code only checks if the sum of demands equals K, but it does not consider the individual demands and whether they can be satisfied sequentially without exceeding the available amount of money at any point.
   - The logic should involve checking if Gru can fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.

4. **Revising the Approach**:
   - We need to check if the total demand is less than or equal to K, and also ensure that the distribution can be done in a way that Gru can satisfy each minion's demand without exceeding his available money at any point.

### Revised Plan:
1. For each test case, read N and K.
2. Read the list of demands.
3. Calculate the total demand.
4. If the total demand is greater than K, output "NO".
5. If the total demand is less than or equal to K, check if Gru can satisfy each demand in a way that he does not run out of money.

### Updated Code:
```python
def can_distribute_money(T):
    # Iterate through each test case

        # Read the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has

            continue
        
        # If total demand is less than or equal to K, check if we can distribute it
        current_money = K
        possible = True

## Instructions

   - Gru has a certain amount of money (K) and there are N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money.
   - The goal is to determine if Gru can distribute exactly K amount of money to the minions based on their demands.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The previous solution incorrectly assumes that sorting the demands and fulfilling them in ascending order is necessary. However, the order of fulfilling demands does not affect whether Gru can spend exactly K. The key is whether the total demand matches K and whether Gru can fulfill each demand without exceeding his available money at any point.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The code checks if the total demand is greater than K, which is correct. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the total demand is less than or equal to K. The logic should ensure that Gru can fulfill all demands without running out of money at any point, but it should also check if the total demand equals K at the end.

4. **Revising the Approach**:
   - We need to check if the total demand is equal to K. If it is, we can output "YES". If the total demand is less than K, we need to ensure that Gru can still fulfill all demands without running out of money.

### Updated Plan:
1. For each test case, read N and K.
2. Read the list of demands.
3. Calculate the total demand.

5. If the total demand is less than or equal to K, check if Gru can fulfill all demands without exceeding K at any point.

### Updated Code:
```python
def can_distribute_money(T):
    # Iterate through each test case
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the demands of each minion
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions
        total_demand = sum(A)
        
        # Check if the total demand is greater than K
        if total_demand > K:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # If total demand is less than or equal to K, check if we can distribute it
        current_money = K
        
        # Check if Gru can fulfill all demands without running out of money
        possible = True
        
        for demand in A:
            if demand <= current_money:
                current_money -= demand
            else:
                possible = False
                break
        
        # Check if Gru has exactly zero money left after distribution
        if possible and current_money == 0:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
# Call the function to process the test cases
can_distribute_money(T)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has.
2. **Demand Calculation**: It calculates the total demand from all minions.
3. **Demand Check**: If the total demand exceeds the amount of money Gru has, it prints "NO".
4. **Distribution Logic**: It checks if Gru can satisfy each demand without running out of money.
5. **Final Check**: It checks if Gru has exactly zero money left after fulfilling the demands and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

This code should now correctly handle the problem as specified.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
This time minions are celebrating Diwali Festival. There are N minions in total. Each of them owns a house. On this Festival, Each of them wants to decorate their house. But none of them have enough money to do that. One of the minion, Kevin, requested Gru for money. Gru agreed for money distribution but he will be giving money to a minion if and only if demanded money is less than or equal to the money Gru have. Now Gru wonders if he can spend all the money or not.

-----Input-----
First line have number of test cases T. Each test case consist of Two Lines. First line contains two space separated integers N and K i.e. Number of minions and Amount of Money Gru have. Next line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,A3,.....,AN representing amount of money demanded by ith minion.

-----Output-----
Output YES if Gru can spend his all of the money on minions i.e. after distribution Gru have zero amount of money else NO.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 102
- 1 â‰¤ K,Ai â‰¤ 109

-----Example-----
Input:
2 
4 9
5 2 2 4
4 9
5 2 18 3

Output:
YES
NO


-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to first minion then remaining 4 Rs. can be given to 2nd and 3rd minion or to the 4th minion. Which will leave zero amount of money in the hands of Gru.
Example case 2.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to the first minion then from remaining 4 Rs. either he can give 2 Rs. to the 2nd minion or 3 Rs. to the fourth minion. Which will leave either 2 Rs. or 1 Rs. in the hands of Gru.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine if Gru can distribute his money to a number of minions such that he spends exactly all the money he has. Each minion demands a certain amount of money, and Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount they demand is less than or equal to the amount Gru has left.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   For each test case, we will sum up the total amount of money demanded by all minions. If this total is equal to the amount of money Gru has, then he can distribute the money exactly as needed, and we will output "YES". If the total is less than or greater than the amount Gru has, we will output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_distribute_money(T):
       for each test case:
           read N and K
           read the list of demands A
           total_demand = sum(A)
           
           if total_demand == K:
               print "YES"
           else:
               print "NO"
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def can_distribute_money(T):
    # Iterate through each test case
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has
        N, K = map(int, input().split())

        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions
        total_demand = sum(A)

            print("NO")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
# Call the function to process the test cases
can_distribute_money(T)
``` 

This code reads the number of test cases, processes each case by reading the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has, calculates the total demand, and checks if it matches Gru's available money, printing "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Gru has a certain amount of money (K) and there are N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money.
   - The goal is to determine if Gru can distribute exactly K amount of money to the minions based on their demands.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The initial solution simply checks if the total demand from all minions equals K. However, this does not account for the fact that Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount they demand is less than or equal to the amount he has at that moment.
   - The solution should also ensure that Gru can distribute the money in such a way that he ends up with exactly zero after fulfilling the demands.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The code only checks if the sum of demands equals K, but it does not consider the individual demands and whether they can be satisfied sequentially without exceeding the available amount of money at any point.
   - The logic should involve checking if Gru can fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.

4. **Revising the Approach**:
   - We need to check if the total demand is less than or equal to K, and also ensure that the distribution can be done in a way that Gru can satisfy each minion's demand without exceeding his available money at any point.

### Revised Plan:
1. For each test case, read N and K.
2. Read the list of demands.
3. Calculate the total demand.
4. If the total demand is greater than K, output "NO".
5. If the total demand is less than or equal to K, check if Gru can satisfy each demand in a way that he does not run out of money.

### Updated Code:
```python
def can_distribute_money(T):
    # Iterate through each test case
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the demands of each minion
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions
        total_demand = sum(A)
        
        # Check if the total demand is greater than K
        if total_demand > K:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # If total demand is less than or equal to K, check if we can distribute it
        current_money = K
        possible = True
        
        for demand in A:
            if demand <= current_money:
                current_money -= demand
            else:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] Let's analyze the situation step-by-step to identify the issues in the latest solution.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Gru has a certain amount of money (K) and there are N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money.
   - The goal is to determine if Gru can distribute exactly K amount of money to the minions based on their demands.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The previous solution incorrectly assumes that sorting the demands and fulfilling them in ascending order is necessary. However, the order of fulfilling demands does not affect whether Gru can spend exactly K. The key is whether the total demand matches K and whether Gru can fulfill each demand without exceeding his available money at any point.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The code checks if the total demand is greater than K, which is correct. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the total demand is less than or equal to K. The logic should ensure that Gru can fulfill all demands without running out of money at any point, but it should also check if the total demand equals K at the end.

4. **Revising the Approach**:
   - We need to check if the total demand is equal to K. If it is, we can output "YES". If the total demand is less than K, we need to ensure that Gru can still fulfill all demands without running out of money.

### Updated Plan:
1. For each test case, read N and K.
2. Read the list of demands.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element by its index any number of times. The key insight was that the total sum of the sequence must be less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, and it must also be non-negative to reach zero.

    Initially, the solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it could always be made zero. This was a flawed assumption because it did not account for the possibility of the total sum being negative, which would make it impossible to reach zero.

    The corrected approach involved:
    1. Calculating the total sum of the sequence.
    2. Calculating the maximum reduction possible using the formula for the sum of the first `N` natural numbers.
    3. Checking both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction and must be non-negative.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
            total_sum = sum(A)
            max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))
        
            if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    can_make_good_sequence(T)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all conditions that affect the outcome, especially when dealing with sums and reductions.
[/Summary]


[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is $0$.
        You have a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. You may perform any number of operations on this sequence (including zero). In one operation, you should choose a valid index $i$ and decrease $A_i$ by $i$. Can you make the sequence good using these operations?

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
        - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
        - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to make the given sequence good or "NO" if it is impossible.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \le T \le 1,000$
        - $1 \le N \le 10$
        - $|A_i| \le 100$ for each valid $i$

        -----Subtasks-----
        Subtask #1 (10 points): $N = 1$
        Subtask #2 (30 points): $N \le 2$
        Subtask #3 (60 points): original constraints

        -----Example Input-----
        2
        1
        -1
        2
        1 2

        -----Example Output-----
        NO
        YES

        -----Explanation-----
        Example case 2: We can perform two operations â€• subtract $1$ from $A_1$ and $2$ from $A_2$.
    [/Task]

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

        1. **Understanding the Problem**:
           We need to determine if we can make the sum of a sequence of integers equal to zero by performing operations that allow us to decrease each element `A[i]` by its index `i` any number of times.

        2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
           The previous solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum of the sequence is less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, we can always achieve a sum of zero. However, this is not necessarily true. The operations we can perform are limited by the indices, and we need to ensure that we can actually reach zero from the current sum, considering the specific values of the elements.

        3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
           - The logic to check if `total_sum <= max_reduction` is not sufficient. We need to consider the actual values of the elements and how much we can reduce each one based on its index.
           - We should also consider the case where the total sum is negative. If the sum is negative, we cannot make it zero since we can only decrease the values.

        4. **Revised Approach**:
           - Calculate the total sum of the sequence.
           - Calculate the maximum reduction possible.
           - If the total sum is positive, check if it can be reduced to zero using the maximum reduction.
           - If the total sum is negative, we cannot make it zero, so the answer should be "NO".

        Now, let's implement the corrected logic in the code.

        ```python
        def can_make_good_sequence(T):
            # Iterate through each test case
            for _ in range(T):
                # Read the number of elements in the sequence
                N = int(input())
                # Read the sequence of integers
                A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
                # Calculate the total sum of the sequence
                total_sum = sum(A)
        
                # Calculate the maximum possible reduction
                max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))  # This is the same as N * (N + 1) // 2
        
                # Check if we can make the sequence good
                if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:
                    print("YES")
                else:
                    print("NO")

        # Read the number of test cases
        T = int(input())
        # Call the function to process the test cases
        can_make_good_sequence(T)
        ``` 

        In this revised code, we ensure that we check both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction, and it must also be non-negative to be able to reach zero.
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will correct the solution to ensure it accurately determines whether the sequence can be made good (i.e., the sum can be made zero) by applying the allowed operations.

        Hereâ€™s the revised code:

        ```python
        def can_make_good_sequence(T):
            # Iterate through each test case
            for _ in range(T):
                # Read the number of elements in the sequence
                N = int(input())
                # Read the sequence of integers
                A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
                # Calculate the total sum of the sequence
                total_sum = sum(A)
        
                # Calculate the maximum possible reduction
                max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))  # This is the same as N * (N + 1) // 2
        
                # Check if we can make the sequence good
                # We can only reduce the total sum, so if total_sum is negative, we cannot make it zero
                if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:
                    print("YES")
                else:
                    print("NO")

        # Read the number of test cases
        T = int(input())
        # Call the function to process the test cases
        can_make_good_sequence(T)
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code:
        1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of elements and the sequence itself.
        2. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the total sum of the sequence.
        3. **Maximum Reduction Calculation**: It computes the maximum reduction possible, which is the sum of the first `N` natural numbers (i.e., `1 + 2 + ... + N`).
        4. **Condition Check**: It checks if the total sum can be reduced to zero:
           - The total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction.
           - The total sum must also be non-negative, as we cannot increase the sum.
        5. **Output**: It prints "YES" if the sequence can be made good, otherwise "NO".

        This code should now correctly handle the problem as specified.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
           We need to determine if we can modify a sequence of integers such that the sum of all its elements becomes zero. The modification allowed is to decrease any element at index `i` by `i` any number of times.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           To solve this problem, we can calculate the total sum of the sequence. If the sum is already zero, we can immediately return "YES". If the sum is positive, we need to check if we can reduce it to zero by using the allowed operations. Each element can be decreased by its index, which means we can reduce the total sum by a maximum of `i` for each element at index `i`. We can calculate the maximum possible reduction and see if it is sufficient to bring the total sum to zero.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function can_make_good_sequence(T):
               for each test case:
                   read N
                   read array A
                   total_sum = sum(A)
                   max_reduction = sum of indices from 1 to N (which is N * (N + 1) / 2)
           
                   if total_sum <= max_reduction:
                       print "YES"
                   else:
                       print "NO"
           ```

INFO - [Task id] 561 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem again and identify the correct approach to ensure that we can determine if Gru can distribute his money to the minions such that he spends exactly all the money he has.

### Problem Restatement:
We need to determine if Gru can distribute his money (K) to N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money. The goal is to check if the total amount demanded by the minions equals K, and if Gru can fulfill each demand without exceeding the amount he has at any point.

### Key Insights:
1. **Total Demand Check**: If the total demand from all minions is greater than K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and we should output "NO".
2. **Exact Distribution**: If the total demand equals K, then Gru can distribute the money exactly, and we should output "YES".
3. **Handling Excess Demand**: If the total demand is less than K, we need to ensure that Gru can still fulfill all demands without running out of money. However, if the total demand is less than K, it does not guarantee that he can distribute the money exactly to reach zero.

### Revised Approach:
1. For each test case, read N and K.
2. Read the list of demands.
3. Calculate the total demand.
4. If the total demand is greater than K, output "NO".
5. If the total demand equals K, output "YES".
6. If the total demand is less than K, output "NO" because Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.

        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions
        total_demand = sum(A)
        
        # Check if the total demand is greater than K

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
This time minions are celebrating Diwali Festival. There are N minions in total. Each of them owns a house. On this Festival, Each of them wants to decorate their house. But none of them have enough money to do that. One of the minion, Kevin, requested Gru for money. Gru agreed for money distribution but he will be giving money to a minion if and only if demanded money is less than or equal to the money Gru have. Now Gru wonders if he can spend all the money or not.

-----Input-----
First line have number of test cases T. Each test case consist of Two Lines. First line contains two space separated integers N and K i.e. Number of minions and Amount of Money Gru have. Next line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,A3,.....,AN representing amount of money demanded by ith minion.

-----Output-----
Output YES if Gru can spend his all of the money on minions i.e. after distribution Gru have zero amount of money else NO.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 102
- 1 â‰¤ K,Ai â‰¤ 109

-----Example-----
Input:
2 
4 9
5 2 2 4
4 9
5 2 18 3

Output:
YES
NO


-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to first minion then remaining 4 Rs. can be given to 2nd and 3rd minion or to the 4th minion. Which will leave zero amount of money in the hands of Gru.
Example case 2.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to the first minion then from remaining 4 Rs. either he can give 2 Rs. to the 2nd minion or 3 Rs. to the fourth minion. Which will leave either 2 Rs. or 1 Rs. in the hands of Gru.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine if Gru can distribute his money to a number of minions such that he spends exactly all the money he has. Each minion demands a certain amount of money, and Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount they demand is less than or equal to the amount Gru has left.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   For each test case, we will sum up the total amount of money demanded by all minions. If this total is equal to the amount of money Gru has, then he can distribute the money exactly as needed, and we will output "YES". If the total is less than or greater than the amount Gru has, we will output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_distribute_money(T):
       for each test case:
           read N and K
           read the list of demands A
           total_demand = sum(A)
           
           if total_demand == K:
               print "YES"
           else:
               print "NO"
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def can_distribute_money(T):
    # Iterate through each test case
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the demands of each minion
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions
        total_demand = sum(A)
        
        # Check if the total demand is equal to the money Gru has
        if total_demand == K:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
# Call the function to process the test cases
can_distribute_money(T)
``` 

This code reads the number of test cases, processes each case by reading the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has, calculates the total demand, and checks if it matches Gru's available money, printing "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Gru has a certain amount of money (K) and there are N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money.
   - The goal is to determine if Gru can distribute exactly K amount of money to the minions based on their demands.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The initial solution simply checks if the total demand from all minions equals K. However, this does not account for the fact that Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount they demand is less than or equal to the amount he has at that moment.
   - The solution should also ensure that Gru can distribute the money in such a way that he ends up with exactly zero after fulfilling the demands.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The code only checks if the sum of demands equals K, but it does not consider the individual demands and whether they can be satisfied sequentially without exceeding the available amount of money at any point.
   - The logic should involve checking if Gru can fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.

4. **Revising the Approach**:
   - We need to check if the total demand is less than or equal to K, and also ensure that the distribution can be done in a way that Gru can satisfy each minion's demand without exceeding his available money at any point.

### Revised Plan:
1. For each test case, read N and K.
2. Read the list of demands.
3. Calculate the total demand.
4. If the total demand is greater than K, output "NO".
5. If the total demand is less than or equal to K, check if Gru can satisfy each demand in a way that he does not run out of money.

### Updated Code:
```python
def can_distribute_money(T):
    # Iterate through each test case
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the demands of each minion
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions
        total_demand = sum(A)
        
        # Check if the total demand is greater than K
        if total_demand > K:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # If total demand is less than or equal to K, check if we can distribute it
        current_money = K
        possible = True
        
        for demand in A:
            if demand <= current_money:
                current_money -= demand
            else:
                possible = False
                break
        
        if possible and current_money == 0:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
# Call the function to process the test cases
can_distribute_money(T)
```

This updated code checks if Gru can distribute the money correctly by ensuring that he does not run out of money while fulfilling each minion's demand. It also checks if he ends up with exactly zero after all distributions.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] Based on the insights and analysis from previous attempts, I will revise the solution to ensure it accurately determines whether Gru can distribute his money to the minions such that he spends exactly all the money he has.

### Revised Approach:
1. For each test case, read the number of minions (N) and the amount of money Gru has (K).
2. Read the list of demands from the minions.
3. Calculate the total demand from all minions.
4. If the total demand is greater than K, output "NO" because Gru cannot fulfill all demands.
5. If the total demand is less than or equal to K, check if Gru can distribute the money in such a way that he ends up with exactly zero after fulfilling the demands.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has.
2. **Demand Calculation**: It calculates the total demand from all minions.
3. **Demand Check**: If the total demand exceeds the amount of money Gru has, it prints "NO".
4. **Distribution Logic**: It sorts the demands and attempts to fulfill them in ascending order, checking if Gru can satisfy each demand without running out of money.
5. **Final Check**: It checks if Gru has exactly zero money left after fulfilling the demands and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

This code should now correctly handle the problem as specified.

   - The goal is to determine if Gru can distribute exactly K amount of money to the minions based on their demands.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The previous solution incorrectly assumes that sorting the demands and fulfilling them in ascending order is necessary. However, the order of fulfilling demands does not affect whether Gru can spend exactly K. The key is whether the total demand matches K and whether Gru can fulfill each demand without exceeding his available money at any point.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The code checks if the total demand is greater than K, which is correct. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the total demand is less than or equal to K. The logic should ensure that Gru can fulfill all demands without running out of money at any point, but it should also check if the total demand equals K at the end.

4. **Revising the Approach**:
   - We need to check if the total demand is equal to K. If it is, we can output "YES". If the total demand is less than K, we need to ensure that Gru can still fulfill all demands without running out of money.

### Updated Plan:
1. For each test case, read N and K.
2. Read the list of demands.

### Problem Restatement:
We need to determine if Gru can distribute his money (K) to N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money. The goal is to check if the total amount demanded by the minions equals K, and if Gru can fulfill each demand without exceeding the amount he has at any point.

### Key Insights:

2. **Exact Distribution**: If the total demand equals K, then Gru can distribute the money exactly, and we should output "YES".
3. **Handling Excess Demand**: If the total demand is less than K, we need to ensure that Gru can still fulfill all demands without running out of money. However, if the total demand is less than K, it does not guarantee that he can distribute the money exactly to reach zero.

### Revised Approach:
1. For each test case, read N and K.
2. Read the list of demands.
3. Calculate the total demand.
4. If the total demand is greater than K, output "NO".
5. If the total demand equals K, output "YES".

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
This time minions are celebrating Diwali Festival. There are N minions in total. Each of them owns a house. On this Festival, Each of them wants to decorate their house. But none of them have enough money to do that. One of the minion, Kevin, requested Gru for money. Gru agreed for money distribution but he will be giving money to a minion if and only if demanded money is less than or equal to the money Gru have. Now Gru wonders if he can spend all the money or not.

-----Input-----
First line have number of test cases T. Each test case consist of Two Lines. First line contains two space separated integers N and K i.e. Number of minions and Amount of Money Gru have. Next line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,A3,.....,AN representing amount of money demanded by ith minion.

-----Output-----
Output YES if Gru can spend his all of the money on minions i.e. after distribution Gru have zero amount of money else NO.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 102
- 1 â‰¤ K,Ai â‰¤ 109

-----Example-----
Input:
2 
4 9
5 2 2 4
4 9
5 2 18 3

Output:
YES
NO


-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to first minion then remaining 4 Rs. can be given to 2nd and 3rd minion or to the 4th minion. Which will leave zero amount of money in the hands of Gru.
Example case 2.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to the first minion then from remaining 4 Rs. either he can give 2 Rs. to the 2nd minion or 3 Rs. to the fourth minion. Which will leave either 2 Rs. or 1 Rs. in the hands of Gru.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine if Gru can distribute his money to a number of minions such that he spends exactly all the money he has. Each minion demands a certain amount of money, and Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount they demand is less than or equal to the amount Gru has left.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   For each test case, we will sum up the total amount of money demanded by all minions. If this total is equal to the amount of money Gru has, then he can distribute the money exactly as needed, and we will output "YES". If the total is less than or greater than the amount Gru has, we will output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_distribute_money(T):
       for each test case:
           read N and K
           read the list of demands A
           total_demand = sum(A)
           
           if total_demand == K:
               print "YES"
           else:
               print "NO"
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def can_distribute_money(T):
    # Iterate through each test case
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the demands of each minion
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions
        total_demand = sum(A)
        
        # Check if the total demand is equal to the money Gru has
        if total_demand == K:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
# Call the function to process the test cases
can_distribute_money(T)
``` 

This code reads the number of test cases, processes each case by reading the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has, calculates the total demand, and checks if it matches Gru's available money, printing "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Gru has a certain amount of money (K) and there are N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money.
   - The goal is to determine if Gru can distribute exactly K amount of money to the minions based on their demands.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The initial solution simply checks if the total demand from all minions equals K. However, this does not account for the fact that Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount they demand is less than or equal to the amount he has at that moment.
   - The solution should also ensure that Gru can distribute the money in such a way that he ends up with exactly zero after fulfilling the demands.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The code only checks if the sum of demands equals K, but it does not consider the individual demands and whether they can be satisfied sequentially without exceeding the available amount of money at any point.
   - The logic should involve checking if Gru can fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.

4. **Revising the Approach**:
   - We need to check if the total demand is less than or equal to K, and also ensure that the distribution can be done in a way that Gru can satisfy each minion's demand without exceeding his available money at any point.

### Revised Plan:
1. For each test case, read N and K.
2. Read the list of demands.
3. Calculate the total demand.
4. If the total demand is greater than K, output "NO".
5. If the total demand is less than or equal to K, check if Gru can satisfy each demand in a way that he does not run out of money.

### Updated Code:
```python
def can_distribute_money(T):
    # Iterate through each test case
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the demands of each minion
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions
        total_demand = sum(A)
        
        # Check if the total demand is greater than K
        if total_demand > K:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # If total demand is less than or equal to K, check if we can distribute it
        current_money = K
        possible = True
        
        for demand in A:
            if demand <= current_money:
                current_money -= demand
            else:
                possible = False
                break
        
        if possible and current_money == 0:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
# Call the function to process the test cases
can_distribute_money(T)
```

This updated code checks if Gru can distribute the money correctly by ensuring that he does not run out of money while fulfilling each minion's demand. It also checks if he ends up with exactly zero after all distributions.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] Based on the insights and analysis from previous attempts, I will revise the solution to ensure it accurately determines whether Gru can distribute his money to the minions such that he spends exactly all the money he has.

### Revised Approach:
1. For each test case, read the number of minions (N) and the amount of money Gru has (K).
2. Read the list of demands from the minions.
3. Calculate the total demand from all minions.
4. If the total demand is greater than K, output "NO" because Gru cannot fulfill all demands.
5. If the total demand is less than or equal to K, check if Gru can distribute the money in such a way that he ends up with exactly zero after fulfilling the demands.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has.
2. **Demand Calculation**: It calculates the total demand from all minions.
3. **Demand Check**: If the total demand exceeds the amount of money Gru has, it prints "NO".
4. **Distribution Logic**: It sorts the demands and attempts to fulfill them in ascending order, checking if Gru can satisfy each demand without running out of money.
5. **Final Check**: It checks if Gru has exactly zero money left after fulfilling the demands and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

   - The goal is to determine if Gru can distribute exactly K amount of money to the minions based on their demands.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The previous solution incorrectly assumes that sorting the demands and fulfilling them in ascending order is necessary. However, the order of fulfilling demands does not affect whether Gru can spend exactly K. The key is whether the total demand matches K and whether Gru can fulfill each demand without exceeding his available money at any point.

4. **Revising the Approach**:
   - We need to check if the total demand is equal to K. If it is, we can output "YES". If the total demand is less than K, we need to ensure that Gru can still fulfill all demands without running out of money.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem again and identify the correct approach to ensure that we can determine if Gru can distribute his money to the minions such that he spends exactly all the money he has.

### Problem Restatement:
We need to determine if Gru can distribute his money (K) to N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money. The goal is to check if the total amount demanded by the minions equals K, and if Gru can fulfill each demand without exceeding the amount he has at any point.

### Key Insights:
1. **Total Demand Check**: If the total demand from all minions is greater than K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and we should output "NO".
2. **Exact Distribution**: If the total demand equals K, then Gru can distribute the money exactly, and we should output "YES".
3. **Handling Excess Demand**: If the total demand is less than K, we need to ensure that Gru can still fulfill all demands without running out of money. However, if the total demand is less than K, it does not guarantee that he can distribute the money exactly to reach zero.

### Revised Approach:
1. For each test case, read N and K.
2. Read the list of demands.
3. Calculate the total demand.
4. If the total demand is greater than K, output "NO".
5. If the total demand equals K, output "YES".

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element by its index any number of times. The key insight was that the total sum of the sequence must be less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, and it must also be non-negative to reach zero.

    Initially, the solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it could always be made zero. This was a flawed assumption because it did not account for the possibility of the total sum being negative, which would make it impossible to reach zero.

    The corrected approach involved:
    1. Calculating the total sum of the sequence.
    2. Calculating the maximum reduction possible using the formula for the sum of the first `N` natural numbers.
    3. Checking both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction and must be non-negative.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
            total_sum = sum(A)
            max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))
        
            if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    can_make_good_sequence(T)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all conditions that affect the outcome, especially when dealing with sums and reductions.

    [Task]:
        Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is $0$.
        You have a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$. You may perform any number of operations on this sequence (including zero). In one operation, you should choose a valid index $i$ and decrease $A_i$ by $i$. Can you make the sequence good using these operations?

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
        - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
        - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to make the given sequence good or "NO" if it is impossible.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \le T \le 1,000$
        - $1 \le N \le 10$
        - $|A_i| \le 100$ for each valid $i$

        -----Subtasks-----
        Subtask #1 (10 points): $N = 1$
        Subtask #2 (30 points): $N \le 2$
        Subtask #3 (60 points): original constraints

        -----Example Input-----
        2
        1
        -1
        2
        1 2

        -----Example Output-----
        NO
        YES

        -----Explanation-----
        Example case 2: We can perform two operations â€• subtract $1$ from $A_1$ and $2$ from $A_2$.
    [/Task]

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

        1. **Understanding the Problem**:
           We need to determine if we can make the sum of a sequence of integers equal to zero by performing operations that allow us to decrease each element `A[i]` by its index `i` any number of times.

        2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
           The previous solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum of the sequence is less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, we can always achieve a sum of zero. However, this is not necessarily true. The operations we can perform are limited by the indices, and we need to ensure that we can actually reach zero from the current sum, considering the specific values of the elements.

        3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
           - The logic to check if `total_sum <= max_reduction` is not sufficient. We need to consider the actual values of the elements and how much we can reduce each one based on its index.
           - We should also consider the case where the total sum is negative. If the sum is negative, we cannot make it zero since we can only decrease the values.

        4. **Revised Approach**:
           - Calculate the total sum of the sequence.
           - Calculate the maximum reduction possible.
           - If the total sum is positive, check if it can be reduced to zero using the maximum reduction.
           - If the total sum is negative, we cannot make it zero, so the answer should be "NO".

        Now, let's implement the corrected logic in the code.

        ```python
        def can_make_good_sequence(T):
            # Iterate through each test case
            for _ in range(T):
                # Read the number of elements in the sequence
                N = int(input())
                # Read the sequence of integers
                A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
                # Calculate the total sum of the sequence
                total_sum = sum(A)
        
                # Calculate the maximum possible reduction
                max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))  # This is the same as N * (N + 1) // 2
        
                # Check if we can make the sequence good
                if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:
                    print("YES")
                else:
                    print("NO")

        # Read the number of test cases
        T = int(input())
        # Call the function to process the test cases
        can_make_good_sequence(T)
        ``` 

        In this revised code, we ensure that we check both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction, and it must also be non-negative to be able to reach zero.
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will correct the solution to ensure it accurately determines whether the sequence can be made good (i.e., the sum can be made zero) by applying the allowed operations.

        Hereâ€™s the revised code:

        ```python
        def can_make_good_sequence(T):
            # Iterate through each test case
            for _ in range(T):
                # Read the number of elements in the sequence
                N = int(input())
                # Read the sequence of integers
                A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
                # Calculate the total sum of the sequence
                total_sum = sum(A)
        
                # Calculate the maximum possible reduction
                max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))  # This is the same as N * (N + 1) // 2
        
                # Check if we can make the sequence good
                # We can only reduce the total sum, so if total_sum is negative, we cannot make it zero
                if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:
                    print("YES")
                else:
                    print("NO")

        # Read the number of test cases
        T = int(input())
        # Call the function to process the test cases
        can_make_good_sequence(T)
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code:
        1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of elements and the sequence itself.
        2. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the total sum of the sequence.
        3. **Maximum Reduction Calculation**: It computes the maximum reduction possible, which is the sum of the first `N` natural numbers (i.e., `1 + 2 + ... + N`).
        4. **Condition Check**: It checks if the total sum can be reduced to zero:
           - The total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction.
           - The total sum must also be non-negative, as we cannot increase the sum.
        5. **Output**: It prints "YES" if the sequence can be made good, otherwise "NO".

        This code should now correctly handle the problem as specified.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
           We need to determine if we can modify a sequence of integers such that the sum of all its elements becomes zero. The modification allowed is to decrease any element at index `i` by `i` any number of times.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           To solve this problem, we can calculate the total sum of the sequence. If the sum is already zero, we can immediately return "YES". If the sum is positive, we need to check if we can reduce it to zero by using the allowed operations. Each element can be decreased by its index, which means we can reduce the total sum by a maximum of `i` for each element at index `i`. We can calculate the maximum possible reduction and see if it is sufficient to bring the total sum to zero.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function can_make_good_sequence(T):
               for each test case:
                   read N
                   read array A
                   total_sum = sum(A)
                   max_reduction = sum of indices from 1 to N (which is N * (N + 1) / 2)
           
                   if total_sum <= max_reduction:
                       print "YES"
                   else:
                       print "NO"
           ```

INFO - [Task id] 561 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem again and identify the correct approach to ensure that we can determine if Gru can distribute his money to the minions such that he spends exactly all the money he has.

### Problem Restatement:
We need to determine if Gru can distribute his money (K) to N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money. The goal is to check if the total amount demanded by the minions equals K, and if Gru can fulfill each demand without exceeding the amount he has at any point.

### Key Insights:
1. **Total Demand Check**: If the total demand from all minions is greater than K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and we should output "NO".
2. **Exact Distribution**: If the total demand equals K, then Gru can distribute the money exactly, and we should output "YES".
3. **Handling Excess Demand**: If the total demand is less than K, we need to ensure that Gru can still fulfill all demands without running out of money. However, if the total demand is less than K, it does not guarantee that he can distribute the money exactly to reach zero.

### Revised Approach:
1. For each test case, read N and K.
2. Read the list of demands.
3. Calculate the total demand.
4. If the total demand is greater than K, output "NO".
5. If the total demand equals K, output "YES".
6. If the total demand is less than K, output "NO" because Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.

### Updated Code:
```python
def can_distribute_money(T):
    # Iterate through each test case

        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions
        total_demand = sum(A)

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
This time minions are celebrating Diwali Festival. There are N minions in total. Each of them owns a house. On this Festival, Each of them wants to decorate their house. But none of them have enough money to do that. One of the minion, Kevin, requested Gru for money. Gru agreed for money distribution but he will be giving money to a minion if and only if demanded money is less than or equal to the money Gru have. Now Gru wonders if he can spend all the money or not.

-----Input-----
First line have number of test cases T. Each test case consist of Two Lines. First line contains two space separated integers N and K i.e. Number of minions and Amount of Money Gru have. Next line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,A3,.....,AN representing amount of money demanded by ith minion.

-----Output-----
Output YES if Gru can spend his all of the money on minions i.e. after distribution Gru have zero amount of money else NO.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 102
- 1 â‰¤ K,Ai â‰¤ 109

-----Example-----
Input:
2 
4 9
5 2 2 4
4 9
5 2 18 3

Output:
YES
NO


-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to first minion then remaining 4 Rs. can be given to 2nd and 3rd minion or to the 4th minion. Which will leave zero amount of money in the hands of Gru.
Example case 2.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to the first minion then from remaining 4 Rs. either he can give 2 Rs. to the 2nd minion or 3 Rs. to the fourth minion. Which will leave either 2 Rs. or 1 Rs. in the hands of Gru.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine if Gru can distribute his money to a number of minions such that he spends exactly all the money he has. Each minion demands a certain amount of money, and Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount they demand is less than or equal to the amount Gru has left.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   For each test case, we will sum up the total amount of money demanded by all minions. If this total is equal to the amount of money Gru has, then he can distribute the money exactly as needed, and we will output "YES". If the total is less than or greater than the amount Gru has, we will output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_distribute_money(T):
       for each test case:
           read N and K
           read the list of demands A
           total_demand = sum(A)
           
           if total_demand == K:
               print "YES"
           else:
               print "NO"
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def can_distribute_money(T):
    # Iterate through each test case
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the demands of each minion
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions
        total_demand = sum(A)
        
        # Check if the total demand is equal to the money Gru has
        if total_demand == K:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
# Call the function to process the test cases
can_distribute_money(T)
``` 

This code reads the number of test cases, processes each case by reading the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has, calculates the total demand, and checks if it matches Gru's available money, printing "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Gru has a certain amount of money (K) and there are N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money.
   - The goal is to determine if Gru can distribute exactly K amount of money to the minions based on their demands.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The initial solution simply checks if the total demand from all minions equals K. However, this does not account for the fact that Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount they demand is less than or equal to the amount he has at that moment.
   - The solution should also ensure that Gru can distribute the money in such a way that he ends up with exactly zero after fulfilling the demands.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The code only checks if the sum of demands equals K, but it does not consider the individual demands and whether they can be satisfied sequentially without exceeding the available amount of money at any point.
   - The logic should involve checking if Gru can fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.

4. **Revising the Approach**:
   - We need to check if the total demand is less than or equal to K, and also ensure that the distribution can be done in a way that Gru can satisfy each minion's demand without exceeding his available money at any point.

### Revised Plan:
1. For each test case, read N and K.
2. Read the list of demands.
3. Calculate the total demand.
4. If the total demand is greater than K, output "NO".
5. If the total demand is less than or equal to K, check if Gru can satisfy each demand in a way that he does not run out of money.

### Updated Code:
```python
def can_distribute_money(T):
    # Iterate through each test case
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the demands of each minion
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions
        total_demand = sum(A)
        
        # Check if the total demand is greater than K
        if total_demand > K:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # If total demand is less than or equal to K, check if we can distribute it
        current_money = K
        possible = True
        
        for demand in A:
            if demand <= current_money:
                current_money -= demand
            else:
                possible = False
                break
        
        if possible and current_money == 0:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
# Call the function to process the test cases
can_distribute_money(T)
```

This updated code checks if Gru can distribute the money correctly by ensuring that he does not run out of money while fulfilling each minion's demand. It also checks if he ends up with exactly zero after all distributions.

Output a block of correct python3 code to be executed and evaluated again. 

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] Based on the insights and analysis from previous attempts, I will revise the solution to ensure it accurately determines whether Gru can distribute his money to the minions such that he spends exactly all the money he has.

### Revised Approach:
1. For each test case, read the number of minions (N) and the amount of money Gru has (K).
2. Read the list of demands from the minions.
3. Calculate the total demand from all minions.
4. If the total demand is greater than K, output "NO" because Gru cannot fulfill all demands.
5. If the total demand is less than or equal to K, check if Gru can distribute the money in such a way that he ends up with exactly zero after fulfilling the demands.

### Updated Code:

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has.
2. **Demand Calculation**: It calculates the total demand from all minions.
3. **Demand Check**: If the total demand exceeds the amount of money Gru has, it prints "NO".
4. **Distribution Logic**: It sorts the demands and attempts to fulfill them in ascending order, checking if Gru can satisfy each demand without running out of money.
5. **Final Check**: It checks if Gru has exactly zero money left after fulfilling the demands and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

   - The goal is to determine if Gru can distribute exactly K amount of money to the minions based on their demands.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The previous solution incorrectly assumes that sorting the demands and fulfilling them in ascending order is necessary. However, the order of fulfilling demands does not affect whether Gru can spend exactly K. The key is whether the total demand matches K and whether Gru can fulfill each demand without exceeding his available money at any point.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The code checks if the total demand is greater than K, which is correct. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the total demand is less than or equal to K. The logic should ensure that Gru can fulfill all demands without running out of money at any point, but it should also check if the total demand equals K at the end.

4. **Revising the Approach**:
   - We need to check if the total demand is equal to K. If it is, we can output "YES". If the total demand is less than K, we need to ensure that Gru can still fulfill all demands without running out of money.

We need to determine if Gru can distribute his money (K) to N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money. The goal is to check if the total amount demanded by the minions equals K, and if Gru can fulfill each demand without exceeding the amount he has at any point.

### Key Insights:
1. **Total Demand Check**: If the total demand from all minions is greater than K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and we should output "NO".
2. **Exact Distribution**: If the total demand equals K, then Gru can distribute the money exactly, and we should output "YES".
3. **Handling Excess Demand**: If the total demand is less than K, we need to ensure that Gru can still fulfill all demands without running out of money. However, if the total demand is less than K, it does not guarantee that he can distribute the money exactly to reach zero.

### Revised Approach:
1. For each test case, read N and K.
2. Read the list of demands.
3. Calculate the total demand.
4. If the total demand is greater than K, output "NO".
5. If the total demand equals K, output "YES".
6. If the total demand is less than K, output "NO" because Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.

### Updated Code:
```python
def can_distribute_money(T):
    # Iterate through each test case
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the demands of each minion
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions
        total_demand = sum(A)
        
        # Check if the total demand is greater than K
        if total_demand > K:
            print("NO")
        elif total_demand == K:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
# Call the function to process the test cases
can_distribute_money(T)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has.
2. **Demand Calculation**: It calculates the total demand from all minions.
3. **Demand Check**: 
   - If the total demand exceeds K, it prints "NO".
   - If the total demand equals K, it prints "YES".
   - If the total demand is less than K, it prints "NO" because Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.

This code should now correctly handle the problem as specified and pass all tests.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money (K) to N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money, such that he ends up with exactly zero. The key insights were that if the total demand from all minions exceeds K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and if the total demand equals K, he can distribute the money exactly.

Initially, I implemented a solution that simply checked if the total demand was greater than, equal to, or less than K. However, this approach failed to account for the scenario where the total demand was less than K but could still be distributed in a way that Gru ends up with zero. The logic needed to ensure that Gru could fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.

The correct approach involves:
1. Calculating the total demand.
2. Checking if the total demand exceeds K (output "NO").
3. If the total demand equals K, output "YES".
4. If the total demand is less than K, output "NO" since Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.

The final code snippet that captures this logic is as follows:

```python
def can_distribute_money(T):
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        total_demand = sum(A)
        
        if total_demand > K:
            print("NO")
        elif total_demand == K:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

T = int(input())
can_distribute_money(T)
```

This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the conditions under which money can be distributed and ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
This time minions are celebrating Diwali Festival. There are N minions in total. Each of them owns a house. On this Festival, Each of them wants to decorate their house. But none of them have enough money to do that. One of the minion, Kevin, requested Gru for money. Gru agreed for money distribution but he will be giving money to a minion if and only if demanded money is less than or equal to the money Gru have. Now Gru wonders if he can spend all the money or not.

-----Input-----
First line have number of test cases T. Each test case consist of Two Lines. First line contains two space separated integers N and K i.e. Number of minions and Amount of Money Gru have. Next line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,A3,.....,AN representing amount of money demanded by ith minion.

-----Output-----
Output YES if Gru can spend his all of the money on minions i.e. after distribution Gru have zero amount of money else NO.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 102
- 1 â‰¤ K,Ai â‰¤ 109

-----Example-----
Input:
2 
4 9
5 2 2 4
4 9
5 2 18 3

Output:
YES
NO


-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to first minion then remaining 4 Rs. can be given to 2nd and 3rd minion or to the 4th minion. Which will leave zero amount of money in the hands of Gru.
Example case 2.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to the first minion then from remaining 4 Rs. either he can give 2 Rs. to the 2nd minion or 3 Rs. to the fourth minion. Which will leave either 2 Rs. or 1 Rs. in the hands of Gru.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine if Gru can distribute his money to a number of minions such that he spends exactly all the money he has. Each minion demands a certain amount of money, and Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount they demand is less than or equal to the amount Gru has left.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   For each test case, we will sum up the total amount of money demanded by all minions. If this total is equal to the amount of money Gru has, then he can distribute the money exactly as needed, and we will output "YES". If the total is less than or greater than the amount Gru has, we will output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_distribute_money(T):
       for each test case:
           read N and K
           read the list of demands A
           total_demand = sum(A)
           
           if total_demand == K:
               print "YES"
           else:
               print "NO"
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def can_distribute_money(T):

        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions
        total_demand = sum(A)

            print("NO")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
# Call the function to process the test cases
can_distribute_money(T)
``` 

This code reads the number of test cases, processes each case by reading the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has, calculates the total demand, and checks if it matches Gru's available money, printing "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Gru has a certain amount of money (K) and there are N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money.
   - The goal is to determine if Gru can distribute exactly K amount of money to the minions based on their demands.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The initial solution simply checks if the total demand from all minions equals K. However, this does not account for the fact that Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount they demand is less than or equal to the amount he has at that moment.
   - The solution should also ensure that Gru can distribute the money in such a way that he ends up with exactly zero after fulfilling the demands.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The code only checks if the sum of demands equals K, but it does not consider the individual demands and whether they can be satisfied sequentially without exceeding the available amount of money at any point.
   - The logic should involve checking if Gru can fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.

4. **Revising the Approach**:
   - We need to check if the total demand is less than or equal to K, and also ensure that the distribution can be done in a way that Gru can satisfy each minion's demand without exceeding his available money at any point.

### Revised Plan:
1. For each test case, read N and K.
2. Read the list of demands.
3. Calculate the total demand.
4. If the total demand is greater than K, output "NO".
5. If the total demand is less than or equal to K, check if Gru can satisfy each demand in a way that he does not run out of money.

### Updated Code:

        total_demand = sum(A)
        
        # Check if the total demand is greater than K
        if total_demand > K:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # If total demand is less than or equal to K, check if we can distribute it
        current_money = K
        possible = True
        
        for demand in A:
            if demand <= current_money:

   - The key point is that Gru can only give money to a minion if the amount they demand is less than or equal to the amount he has at that moment. 

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The logic should not only check if the total demand equals K but also ensure that Gru can fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point. The previous code incorrectly assumed that if the total demand is less than K, it should output "NO".

4. **Revising the Approach**:
   - We need to check if the total demand is equal to K. If it is, we can output "YES". If the total demand is less than K, we need to ensure that Gru can still fulfill all demands without running out of money.

### Updated Plan:
1. For each test case, read N and K.
2. Read the list of demands.
3. Calculate the total demand.
4. If the total demand is greater than K, output "NO".
5. If the total demand equals K, output "YES".
6. If the total demand is less than K, check if Gru can fulfill all demands without exceeding K at any point.

### Updated Code:
```python
def can_distribute_money(T):
    # Iterate through each test case
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the demands of each minion
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions
        total_demand = sum(A)
        
        # Check if the total demand is greater than K
        if total_demand > K:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # If total demand is less than or equal to K, check if we can distribute it
        current_money = K
        
        # Check if Gru can fulfill all demands without running out of money
        possible = True
        
        for demand in A:
            if demand <= current_money:
                current_money -= demand
            else:
                possible = False
                break
        
        # Check if Gru has exactly zero money left after distribution
        if possible and current_money == 0:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
# Call the function to process the test cases
can_distribute_money(T)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has.
2. **Demand Calculation**: It calculates the total demand from all minions.
3. **Demand Check**: If the total demand exceeds the amount of money Gru has, it prints "NO".
4. **Distribution Logic**: It checks if Gru can satisfy each demand without running out of money.
5. **Final Check**: It checks if Gru has exactly zero money left after fulfilling the demands and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

This code should now correctly handle the problem as specified and pass all tests.

INFO - [Task id] 561 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem again and identify the correct approach to ensure that we can determine if Gru can distribute his money to the minions such that he spends exactly all the money he has.

### Problem Restatement:
We need to determine if Gru can distribute his money (K) to N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money. The goal is to check if the total amount demanded by the minions equals K, and if Gru can fulfill each demand without exceeding the amount he has at any point.

### Key Insights:
1. **Total Demand Check**: If the total demand from all minions is greater than K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and we should output "NO".
2. **Exact Distribution**: If the total demand equals K, then Gru can distribute the money exactly, and we should output "YES".
3. **Handling Excess Demand**: If the total demand is less than K, we need to ensure that Gru can still fulfill all demands without running out of money. However, if the total demand is less than K, it does not guarantee that he can distribute the money exactly to reach zero.

### Revised Approach:
1. For each test case, read N and K.
2. Read the list of demands.
3. Calculate the total demand.
4. If the total demand is greater than K, output "NO".
5. If the total demand equals K, output "YES".
6. If the total demand is less than K, output "NO" because Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.

### Updated Code:
```python
def can_distribute_money(T):
    # Iterate through each test case
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the demands of each minion
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions
        total_demand = sum(A)
        
        # Check if the total demand is greater than K
        if total_demand > K:
            print("NO")
        elif total_demand == K:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
# Call the function to process the test cases
can_distribute_money(T)

INFO - [Task id] 561 [generation text] ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience

In my attempts to solve the problem of whether Gru can distribute his money to the minions such that he spends exactly all the money he has, I initially focused on checking the total demand against the available money (K). However, my approach failed to account for the nuances of the problem, particularly the need to explore combinations of demands that could sum up to K.

The official solution employs a recursive function, `find_combinations`, which explores all possible combinations of the demands to determine if any subset sums to K. This approach is more effective because it directly addresses the core requirement of the problem: finding a combination of demands that exactly matches the available money. My previous solutions only checked if the total demand was equal to K, which is insufficient since the demands could be distributed in various ways.

Key insights from the official solution:
1. **Recursive Exploration**: The use of recursion allows for a comprehensive exploration of all possible combinations of demands.
2. **Base Cases**: The function handles base cases effectively, returning an empty list when there are no demands left and checking if the remaining sum is zero.
3. **Combination Generation**: The solution constructs combinations by including or excluding each demand, which is crucial for solving the problem correctly.

In summary, my initial approach lacked the necessary depth to explore combinations, leading to incorrect conclusions. The official solution's recursive method provides a robust framework for addressing the problem, highlighting the importance of considering all possible subsets when dealing with sum-related problems.
