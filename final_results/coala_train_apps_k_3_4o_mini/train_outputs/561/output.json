    "raw_msg": "Let's analyze the problem again and identify the correct approach to ensure that we can determine if Gru can distribute his money to the minions such that he spends exactly all the money he has.\n\n### Problem Restatement:\nWe need to determine if Gru can distribute his money (K) to N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money. The goal is to check if the total amount demanded by the minions equals K, and if Gru can fulfill each demand without exceeding the amount he has at any point.\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Total Demand Check**: If the total demand from all minions is greater than K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and we should output \"NO\".\n2. **Exact Distribution**: If the total demand equals K, then Gru can distribute the money exactly, and we should output \"YES\".\n3. **Handling Excess Demand**: If the total demand is less than K, we need to ensure that Gru can still fulfill all demands without running out of money. However, if the total demand is less than K, it does not guarantee that he can distribute the money exactly to reach zero.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. For each test case, read N and K.\n2. Read the list of demands.\n3. Calculate the total demand.\n4. If the total demand is greater than K, output \"NO\".\n5. If the total demand equals K, output \"YES\".\n6. If the total demand is less than K, output \"NO\" because Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.\n\n### Updated Code:\n```python\ndef can_distribute_money(T):\n    # Iterate through each test case\n    for _ in range(T):\n        # Read the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        # Read the demands of each minion\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions\n        total_demand = sum(A)\n        \n        # Check if the total demand is greater than K\n        if total_demand > K:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        elif total_demand == K:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\n# Call the function to process the test cases\ncan_distribute_money(T)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of minions and the amount of money Gru has.\n2. **Demand Calculation**: It calculates the total demand from all minions.\n3. **Demand Check**: \n   - If the total demand exceeds K, it prints \"NO\".\n   - If the total demand equals K, it prints \"YES\".\n   - If the total demand is less than K, it prints \"NO\" because Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.\n\nThis code should now correctly handle the problem as specified and pass all tests.",
