There are N minions in total. Each of them owns a house. On this Festival, Each of them wants to decorate their house. But none of them have enough money to do that. One of the minion, Kevin, requested Gru for money. Gru agreed for money distribution but he will be giving money to a minion if and only if demanded money is less than or equal to the money Gru have. Now Gru wonders if he can spend all the money or not.\n\n-----Input-----\nFirst line have number of test cases T. Each test case consist of Two Lines. First line contains two space separated integers N and K i.e. Number of minions and Amount of Money Gru have. Next line contains N space separated integers A1,A2,A3,.....,AN representing amount of money demanded by ith minion.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput YES if Gru can spend his all of the money on minions i.e. after distribution Gru have zero amount of money else NO.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 105\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 102\n- 1 \u2264 K,Ai \u2264 109\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n2 \n4 9\n5 2 2 4\n4 9\n5 2 18 3\n\nOutput:\nYES\nNO\n\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to first minion then remaining 4 Rs. can be given to 2nd and 3rd minion or to the 4th minion. Which will leave zero amount of money in the hands of Gru.\nExample case 2.At first Gru is having 9 Rs. If he gives 5 Rs. to the first minion then from remaining 4 Rs. either he can give 2 Rs. to the 2nd minion or 3 Rs. to the fourth minion. Which will leave either 2 Rs. or 1 Rs. in the hands of Gru.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The key insight was that the total sum of the sequence must be less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, and it must also be non-negative to reach zero.\n\n    Initially, the solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it could always be made zero. This was a flawed assumption because it did not account for the possibility of the total sum being negative, which would make it impossible to reach zero.\n\n    The corrected approach involved:\n    1. Calculating the total sum of the sequence.\n    2. Calculating the maximum reduction possible using the formula for the sum of the first `N` natural numbers.\n    3. Checking both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction and must be non-negative.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total_sum = sum(A)\n            max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))\n        \n            if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    can_make_good_sequence(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all conditions that affect the outcome, especially when dealing with sums and reductions.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is $0$.\n        You have a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$.

However, this is not necessarily true. The operations we can perform are limited by the indices, and we need to ensure that we can actually reach zero from the current sum, considering the specific values of the elements.\n\n        3. **Where I Went Wrong**:\n           - The logic to check if `total_sum <= max_reduction` is not sufficient. We need to consider the actual values of the elements and how much we can reduce each one based on its index.\n           - We should also consider the case where the total sum is negative. If the sum is negative, we cannot make it zero since we can only decrease the values.\n\n        4. **Revised Approach**:\n           - Calculate the total sum of the sequence.\n           - Calculate the maximum reduction possible.\n           - If the total sum is positive, check if it can be reduced to zero using the maximum reduction.\n           - If the total sum is negative, we cannot make it zero, so the answer should be \"NO\".\n\n        Now, let's implement the corrected logic in the code.\n\n        ```python\n        def can_make_good_sequence(T):\n            # Iterate through each test case\n            for _ in range(T):\n                # Read the number of elements in the sequence\n                N = int(input())\n                # Read the sequence of integers\n                A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n                # Calculate the total sum of the sequence\n                total_sum = sum(A)\n        \n                # Calculate the maximum possible reduction\n                max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))  # This is the same as N * (N + 1) // 2\n        \n                # Check if we can make the sequence good\n                if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        # Read the number of test cases\n        T = int(input())\n        # Call the function to process the test cases\n        can_make_good_sequence(T)\n        ``` \n\n        In this revised code, we ensure that we check both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction, and it must also be non-negative to be able to reach zero.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will correct the solution to ensure it accurately determines whether the sequence can be made good (i.e., the sum can be made zero) by applying the allowed operations.\n\n        Here\u2019s the revised code:\n\n        ```python\n        def can_make_good_sequence(T):\n            # Iterate through each test case\n            for _ in range(T):\n                # Read the number of elements in the sequence\n                N = int(input())\n                # Read the sequence of integers\n                A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n                # Calculate the total sum of the sequence\n                total_sum = sum(A)\n        \n                # Calculate the maximum possible reduction\n                max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))  # This is the same as N * (N + 1) // 2\n        \n                # Check if we can make the sequence good\n                # We can only reduce the total sum, so if total_sum is negative, we cannot make it zero\n                if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        # Read the number of test cases\n        T = int(input())\n        # Call the function to process the test cases\n        can_make_good_sequence(T)\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Code:\n        1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of elements and the sequence itself.\n        2. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the total sum of the sequence.\n        3. **Maximum Reduction Calculation**: It computes the maximum reduction possible, which is the sum of the first `N` natural numbers (i.e., `1 + 2 + ... + N`).\n        4. **Condition Check**: It checks if the total sum can be reduced to zero:\n           - The total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction.\n           - The total sum must also be non-negative, as we cannot increase the sum.\n        5. **Output**: It prints \"YES\" if the sequence can be made good, otherwise \"NO\".\n\n        This code should now correctly handle the problem as specified.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['2', '1', '-1', '2', '1 2'] Output: NO\n        YES\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"

The key insight was that the total sum of the sequence must be less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, and it must also be non-negative to reach zero.\n\n    Initially, the solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it could always be made zero. This was a flawed assumption because it did not account for the possibility of the total sum being negative, which would make it impossible to reach zero.\n\n    The corrected approach involved:\n    1. Calculating the total sum of the sequence.\n    2. Calculating the maximum reduction possible using the formula for the sum of the first `N` natural numbers.\n    3. Checking both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction and must be non-negative.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total_sum = sum(A)\n            max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))\n        \n            if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    can_make_good_sequence(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all conditions that affect the outcome, especially when dealing with sums and reductions.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is $0$.\n        You have a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$.

However, this is not necessarily true. The operations we can perform are limited by the indices, and we need to ensure that we can actually reach zero from the current sum, considering the specific values of the elements.\n\n        3. **Where I Went Wrong**:\n           - The logic to check if `total_sum <= max_reduction` is not sufficient. We need to consider the actual values of the elements and how much we can reduce each one based on its index.\n           - We should also consider the case where the total sum is negative. If the sum is negative, we cannot make it zero since we can only decrease the values.\n\n        4. **Revised Approach**:\n           - Calculate the total sum of the sequence.\n           - Calculate the maximum reduction possible.\n           - If the total sum is positive, check if it can be reduced to zero using the maximum reduction.\n           - If the total sum is negative, we cannot make it zero, so the answer should be \"NO\".\n\n        Now, let's implement the corrected logic in the code.\n\n        ```python\n        def can_make_good_sequence(T):\n            # Iterate through each test case\n            for _ in range(T):\n                # Read the number of elements in the sequence\n                N = int(input())\n                # Read the sequence of integers\n                A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n                # Calculate the total sum of the sequence\n                total_sum = sum(A)\n        \n                # Calculate the maximum possible reduction\n                max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))  # This is the same as N * (N + 1) // 2\n        \n                # Check if we can make the sequence good\n                if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        # Read the number of test cases\n        T = int(input())\n        # Call the function to process the test cases\n        can_make_good_sequence(T)\n        ``` \n\n        In this revised code, we ensure that we check both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction, and it must also be non-negative to be able to reach zero.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will correct the solution to ensure it accurately determines whether the sequence can be made good (i.e., the sum can be made zero) by applying the allowed operations.\n\n        Here\u2019s the revised code:\n\n        ```python\n        def can_make_good_sequence(T):\n            # Iterate through each test case\n            for _ in range(T):\n                # Read the number of elements in the sequence\n                N = int(input())\n                # Read the sequence of integers\n                A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n                # Calculate the total sum of the sequence\n                total_sum = sum(A)\n        \n                # Calculate the maximum possible reduction\n                max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))  # This is the same as N * (N + 1) // 2\n        \n                # Check if we can make the sequence good\n                # We can only reduce the total sum, so if total_sum is negative, we cannot make it zero\n                if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        # Read the number of test cases\n        T = int(input())\n        # Call the function to process the test cases\n        can_make_good_sequence(T)\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Code:\n        1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of elements and the sequence itself.\n        2. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the total sum of the sequence.\n        3. **Maximum Reduction Calculation**: It computes the maximum reduction possible, which is the sum of the first `N` natural numbers (i.e., `1 + 2 + ... + N`).\n        4. **Condition Check**: It checks if the total sum can be reduced to zero:\n           - The total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction.\n           - The total sum must also be non-negative, as we cannot increase the sum.\n        5. **Output**: It prints \"YES\" if the sequence can be made good, otherwise \"NO\".\n\n        This code should now correctly handle the problem as specified.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['2', '1', '-1', '2', '1 2'] Output: NO\n        YES\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is $0$.\n        You have a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$.

The key insight was that the total sum of the sequence must be less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, and it must also be non-negative to reach zero.\n\n    Initially, the solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it could always be made zero. This was a flawed assumption because it did not account for the possibility of the total sum being negative, which would make it impossible to reach zero.\n\n    The corrected approach involved:\n    1. Calculating the total sum of the sequence.\n    2. Calculating the maximum reduction possible using the formula for the sum of the first `N` natural numbers.\n    3. Checking both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction and must be non-negative.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total_sum = sum(A)\n            max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))\n        \n            if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    can_make_good_sequence(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all conditions that affect the outcome, especially when dealing with sums and reductions.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is $0$.\n        You have a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$.

However, this is not necessarily true. The operations we can perform are limited by the indices, and we need to ensure that we can actually reach zero from the current sum, considering the specific values of the elements.\n\n        3. **Where I Went Wrong**:\n           - The logic to check if `total_sum <= max_reduction` is not sufficient. We need to consider the actual values of the elements and how much we can reduce each one based on its index.\n           - We should also consider the case where the total sum is negative. If the sum is negative, we cannot make it zero since we can only decrease the values.\n\n        4. **Revised Approach**:\n           - Calculate the total sum of the sequence.\n           - Calculate the maximum reduction possible.\n           - If the total sum is positive, check if it can be reduced to zero using the maximum reduction.\n           - If the total sum is negative, we cannot make it zero, so the answer should be \"NO\".\n\n        Now, let's implement the corrected logic in the code.\n\n        ```python\n        def can_make_good_sequence(T):\n            # Iterate through each test case\n            for _ in range(T):\n                # Read the number of elements in the sequence\n                N = int(input())\n                # Read the sequence of integers\n                A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n                # Calculate the total sum of the sequence\n                total_sum = sum(A)\n        \n                # Calculate the maximum possible reduction\n                max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))  # This is the same as N * (N + 1) // 2\n        \n                # Check if we can make the sequence good\n                if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        # Read the number of test cases\n        T = int(input())\n        # Call the function to process the test cases\n        can_make_good_sequence(T)\n        ``` \n\n        In this revised code, we ensure that we check both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction, and it must also be non-negative to be able to reach zero.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will correct the solution to ensure it accurately determines whether the sequence can be made good (i.e., the sum can be made zero) by applying the allowed operations.\n\n        Here\u2019s the revised code:\n\n        ```python\n        def can_make_good_sequence(T):\n            # Iterate through each test case\n            for _ in range(T):\n                # Read the number of elements in the sequence\n                N = int(input())\n                # Read the sequence of integers\n                A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n                # Calculate the total sum of the sequence\n                total_sum = sum(A)\n        \n                # Calculate the maximum possible reduction\n                max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))  # This is the same as N * (N + 1) // 2\n        \n                # Check if we can make the sequence good\n                # We can only reduce the total sum, so if total_sum is negative, we cannot make it zero\n                if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        # Read the number of test cases\n        T = int(input())\n        # Call the function to process the test cases\n        can_make_good_sequence(T)\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Code:\n        1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of elements and the sequence itself.\n        2. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the total sum of the sequence.\n        3. **Maximum Reduction Calculation**: It computes the maximum reduction possible, which is the sum of the first `N` natural numbers (i.e., `1 + 2 + ... + N`).\n        4. **Condition Check**: It checks if the total sum can be reduced to zero:\n           - The total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction.\n           - The total sum must also be non-negative, as we cannot increase the sum.\n        5. **Output**: It prints \"YES\" if the sequence can be made good, otherwise \"NO\".\n\n        This code should now correctly handle the problem as specified.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['2', '1', '-1', '2', '1 2'] Output: NO\n        YES\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is $0$.\n        You have a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$.

The key insight was that the total sum of the sequence must be less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, and it must also be non-negative to reach zero.\n\n    Initially, the solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it could always be made zero. This was a flawed assumption because it did not account for the possibility of the total sum being negative, which would make it impossible to reach zero.\n\n    The corrected approach involved:\n    1. Calculating the total sum of the sequence.\n    2. Calculating the maximum reduction possible using the formula for the sum of the first `N` natural numbers.\n    3. Checking both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction and must be non-negative.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total_sum = sum(A)\n            max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))\n        \n            if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    can_make_good_sequence(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all conditions that affect the outcome, especially when dealing with sums and reductions.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is $0$.\n        You have a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$.

However, this is not necessarily true. The operations we can perform are limited by the indices, and we need to ensure that we can actually reach zero from the current sum, considering the specific values of the elements.\n\n        3. **Where I Went Wrong**:\n           - The logic to check if `total_sum <= max_reduction` is not sufficient. We need to consider the actual values of the elements and how much we can reduce each one based on its index.\n           - We should also consider the case where the total sum is negative. If the sum is negative, we cannot make it zero since we can only decrease the values.\n\n        4. **Revised Approach**:\n           - Calculate the total sum of the sequence.\n           - Calculate the maximum reduction possible.\n           - If the total sum is positive, check if it can be reduced to zero using the maximum reduction.\n           - If the total sum is negative, we cannot make it zero, so the answer should be \"NO\".\n\n        Now, let's implement the corrected logic in the code.\n\n        ```python\n        def can_make_good_sequence(T):\n            # Iterate through each test case\n            for _ in range(T):\n                # Read the number of elements in the sequence\n                N = int(input())\n                # Read the sequence of integers\n                A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n                # Calculate the total sum of the sequence\n                total_sum = sum(A)\n        \n                # Calculate the maximum possible reduction\n                max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))  # This is the same as N * (N + 1) // 2\n        \n                # Check if we can make the sequence good\n                if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        # Read the number of test cases\n        T = int(input())\n        # Call the function to process the test cases\n        can_make_good_sequence(T)\n        ``` \n\n        In this revised code, we ensure that we check both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction, and it must also be non-negative to be able to reach zero.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will correct the solution to ensure it accurately determines whether the sequence can be made good (i.e., the sum can be made zero) by applying the allowed operations.\n\n        Here\u2019s the revised code:\n\n        ```python\n        def can_make_good_sequence(T):\n            # Iterate through each test case\n            for _ in range(T):\n                # Read the number of elements in the sequence\n                N = int(input())\n                # Read the sequence of integers\n                A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n                # Calculate the total sum of the sequence\n                total_sum = sum(A)\n        \n                # Calculate the maximum possible reduction\n                max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))  # This is the same as N * (N + 1) // 2\n        \n                # Check if we can make the sequence good\n                # We can only reduce the total sum, so if total_sum is negative, we cannot make it zero\n                if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n        # Read the number of test cases\n        T = int(input())\n        # Call the function to process the test cases\n        can_make_good_sequence(T)\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Code:\n        1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of elements and the sequence itself.\n        2. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the total sum of the sequence.\n        3. **Maximum Reduction Calculation**: It computes the maximum reduction possible, which is the sum of the first `N` natural numbers (i.e., `1 + 2 + ... + N`).\n        4. **Condition Check**: It checks if the total sum can be reduced to zero:\n           - The total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction.\n           - The total sum must also be non-negative, as we cannot increase the sum.\n        5. **Output**: It prints \"YES\" if the sequence can be made good, otherwise \"NO\".\n\n        This code should now correctly handle the problem as specified.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['2', '1', '-1', '2', '1 2'] Output: NO\n        YES\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Let's call a sequence good if the sum of all its elements is $0$.\n        You have a sequence of integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$.

        "content": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\nIn my attempts to solve the problem of whether Gru can distribute his money to the minions such that he spends exactly all the money he has, I initially focused on checking the total demand against the available money (K). However, my approach failed to account for the nuances of the problem, particularly the need to explore combinations of demands that could sum up to K.\n\nThe official solution employs a recursive function, `find_combinations`, which explores all possible combinations of the demands to determine if any subset sums to K. This approach is more effective because it directly addresses the core requirement of the problem: finding a combination of demands that exactly matches the available money. My previous solutions only checked if the total demand was equal to K, which is insufficient since the demands could be distributed in various ways.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n1. **Recursive Exploration**: The use of recursion allows for a comprehensive exploration of all possible combinations of demands.\n2. **Base Cases**: The function handles base cases effectively, returning an empty list when there are no demands left and checking if the remaining sum is zero.\n3. **Combination Generation**: The solution constructs combinations by including or excluding each demand, which is crucial for solving the problem correctly.\n\nIn summary, my initial approach lacked the necessary depth to explore combinations, leading to incorrect conclusions. The official solution's recursive method provides a robust framework for addressing the problem, highlighting the importance of considering all possible subsets when dealing with sum-related problems."
