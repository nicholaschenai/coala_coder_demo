    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   Indraneel has a collection of books numbered from 1 to N, arranged in a certain order. He wants to rearrange them in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can take any book and place it in a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of such moves required to sort the books.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: \n   To solve this problem, we can identify the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement of books. The reason for this is that the books that are already in the correct order (part of the LIS) do not need to be moved. Therefore, the minimum number of moves required to sort the shelf will be the total number of books minus the length of the LIS. This approach is efficient and allows us to minimize the number of moves.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function minMovesToSort(N, books):\n       # Create a list to store the longest increasing subsequence\n       lis = []\n       \n       for book in books:\n           # Use binary search to find the position to replace or extend the LIS\n           pos = binary_search(lis, book)\n           if pos < len(lis):\n               lis[pos] = book  # Replace the element\n           else:\n               lis.append(book)  # Extend the LIS\n       \n       # The minimum moves required is total books minus the length of LIS\n       return N - len(lis)\n\n   function binary_search(lis, book):\n       # Implement binary search to find the correct position\n       left, right = 0, len(lis)\n       while left < right:\n           mid = (left + right) // 2\n           if lis[mid] < book:\n               left = mid + 1\n           else:\n               right = mid\n       return left\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python Solution**:\n```python\ndef binary_search(lis, book):\n    # Implement binary search to find the correct position\n    left, right = 0, len(lis)\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if lis[mid] < book:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    return left\n\ndef minMovesToSort(N, books):\n    # Create a list to store the longest increasing subsequence\n    lis = []\n    \n    for book in books:\n        # Use binary search to find the position to replace or extend the LIS\n        pos = binary_search(lis, book)\n        if pos < len(lis):\n            lis[pos] = book  # Replace the element\n        else:\n            lis.append(book)  # Extend the LIS\n    \n    # The minimum moves required is total books minus the length of LIS\n    return N - len(lis)\n```",
