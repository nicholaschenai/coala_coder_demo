## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Indraneel has to sort the books in his library. His library has one long shelf. His books are numbered $1$ through $N$ and he wants to rearrange the books so that they appear in the sequence $1,2, ..., N$.
He intends to do this by a sequence of moves. In each move he can pick up any book from the shelf and insert it at a different place in the shelf. Suppose Indraneel has $5$ books and they are initially arranged in the order
21453214532 \quad 1 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
Indraneel will rearrange this in ascending order by first moving book $1$ to the beginning of the shelf to get
12453124531 \quad 2 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
Then, moving book $3$ to position $3$, he gets
12345123451 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5
Your task is to write a program to help Indraneel determine the minimum number of moves that are necessary to sort his book shelf.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input will contain a single integer $N$ indicating the number of books in Indraneel's library. This is followed by a line containing a permutation of $1, 2, ..., N$ indicating the intial state of Indraneel's book-shelf.

-----Output:-----
A single integer indicating the minimum number of moves necessary to sort Indraneel's book-shelf.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 200000$.
- You may also assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs, $1 \leq N \leq 5000$.

-----Sample Input-----

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Indraneel has a collection of books numbered from 1 to N, arranged in a certain order on a shelf. He wants to rearrange them in ascending order (1, 2, ..., N) using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can take any book and place it in a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine how many moves are necessary to achieve the sorted order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to identify the longest subsequence of books that are already in the correct order. The reason for this is that the books that are already in the correct position do not need to be moved. The minimum number of moves required to sort the shelf will then be the total number of books minus the length of this longest subsequence. We can find this longest subsequence using a method similar to finding the longest increasing subsequence.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function min_moves_to_sort(N, books):
       create an array 'position' of size N+1
       for i from 0 to N-1:
           position[books[i]] = i
       
       longest_increasing_length = 0
       current_length = 0
       
       for i from 1 to N:
           if position[i] > position[i-1]:
               current_length += 1
           else:
               longest_increasing_length = max(longest_increasing_length, current_length)
               current_length = 1
       
       longest_increasing_length = max(longest_increasing_length, current_length)
       
       return N - longest_increasing_length
   ```

def min_moves_to_sort(N, books):
    # Create an array to store the position of each book
    position = [0] * (N + 1)
    
    # Fill the position array with the index of each book
    for i in range(N):
        position[books[i]] = i
    
    longest_increasing_length = 0

[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of finding the maximum number of indices that can be visited in an array based on specific jump conditions, I initially implemented a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The main challenge was ensuring that the jump validity checks were correctly implemented, particularly the conditions that required the starting index's value to be greater than the destination index's value and all intermediate values.

    The first attempts failed due to incorrect handling of the jump conditions, leading to undercounting the maximum indices visited. The use of a visited set was appropriate, but it did not account for all valid paths effectively. The solution was improved by introducing a dynamic programming (DP) array to store results of previously computed indices, which significantly reduced redundant calculations.

    The final solution involved a DFS function that checks both left and right jumps within the allowed distance `d`, ensuring that all conditions for valid jumps were met. The use of memoization with the DP array allowed for efficient computation, ultimately passing all test cases.

    Key code snippet for the final solution:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def maxJumps(self, arr: list[int], d: int) -> int:
            n = len(arr)
            dp = [-1] * n  # To store the maximum jumps from each index
        
            def dfs(index):
                if dp[index] != -1:
                    return dp[index]  # Return already computed result
            
                max_count = 1  # Count the current index
            
                # Check jumps to the right
                for x in range(1, d + 1):
                    if index + x < n and arr[index] > arr[index + x]:
                        if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index + 1, index + x + 1)):
                            max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index + x))
            
                # Check jumps to the left
                for x in range(1, d + 1):
                    if index - x >= 0 and arr[index] > arr[index - x]:
                        if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index - 1, index - x - 1, -1)):
                            max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index - x))
            
                dp[index] = max_count  # Store the result
                return max_count

            max_jumps = 0
            for index in range(n):
                max_jumps = max(max_jumps, dfs(index))  # Update max jumps
            return max_jumps
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully validating conditions in recursive algorithms and the utility of memoization in optimizing performance.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of determining the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock after a series of smashes, I identified that the core concept revolves around partitioning the weights of the rocks. The goal is to minimize the difference between two groups of weights, which can be approached using dynamic programming.

    The strategy involved calculating the total weight of the rocks and then using a dynamic programming array to track achievable sums up to half of the total weight. By iterating through each rock and updating the DP array, I was able to determine the largest sum that could be formed without exceeding the target. The final result is derived from the total weight minus twice this sum.

    The implemented solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating that the approach of using dynamic programming to solve a subset sum-like problem was effective. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
            total_weight = sum(stones)
            target = total_weight // 2
            dp = [False] * (target + 1)
            dp[0] = True

            for stone in stones:
                for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):
                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]

            for j in range(target, -1, -1):
                if dp[j]:
                    return total_weight - 2 * j
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in problems and applying dynamic programming techniques to optimize solutions.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.
        Each turn, we choose any two rocks and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:

        If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
        If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.

        At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the smallest possible weight of this stone (the weight is 0 if there are no stones left.)
 
        Example 1:
        Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
        Output: 1
        Explanation: 
        We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,
        we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
        we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
        we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the optimal value.

 
        Note:

        1 <= stones.length <= 30
        1 <= stones[i] <= 100

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restatement of the Problem**: 
           We have a collection of rocks, each with a positive integer weight. When we smash two rocks together, if they have the same weight, both are destroyed. If they have different weights, the lighter rock is destroyed, and the heavier rock's weight is reduced by the weight of the lighter rock. The goal is to determine the smallest possible weight of the remaining rock after performing all possible smashes.

        2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: 
           The problem can be approached using dynamic programming. The idea is to consider the weights of the rocks as a set of integers and find a way to partition these weights into two groups such that the difference between the sums of the two groups is minimized. This is akin to the "subset sum problem" where we want to find a subset of weights that can be summed to a value as close to half of the total weight as possible. The smallest possible weight of the remaining rock will be the absolute difference between the total weight and twice the sum of the closest subset to half of the total weight.

        3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
           ```
           function lastStoneWeightII(stones):
               total_weight = sum(stones)
               target = total_weight // 2
               dp = array of size (target + 1) initialized to False
               dp[0] = True  // We can always form the sum 0

               for each stone in stones:
                   for j from target down to stone:
                       dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]

               for j from target down to 0:
                   if dp[j] is True:
                       return total_weight - 2 * j
           ```

        4. **Final Python Solution**:
        ```python
        class Solution:
            def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
                # Calculate the total weight of all stones
                total_weight = sum(stones)
                # The target is half of the total weight
                target = total_weight // 2
                # Create a DP array to track achievable weights
                dp = [False] * (target + 1)
                dp[0] = True  # We can always form the sum 0

                # Iterate through each stone
                for stone in stones:
                    # Update the DP array from back to front
                    for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):
                        dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]

                # Find the largest j such that dp[j] is True
                for j in range(target, -1, -1):

   To solve this problem, we can identify the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement of books. The reason for this is that the books that are already in the correct order (part of the LIS) do not need to be moved. Therefore, the minimum number of moves required to sort the shelf will be the total number of books minus the length of the LIS. This approach is efficient and allows us to minimize the number of moves.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function minMovesToSort(N, books):
       # Create a list to store the longest increasing subsequence
       lis = []
       
       for book in books:
           # Use binary search to find the position to replace or extend the LIS
           pos = binary_search(lis, book)
           if pos < len(lis):
               lis[pos] = book  # Replace the element
           else:
               lis.append(book)  # Extend the LIS
       
       # The minimum moves required is total books minus the length of LIS
       return N - len(lis)

       # Implement binary search to find the correct position

 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: 
   Indraneel has a collection of books numbered from 1 to N, arranged in a certain order. He wants to rearrange them in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can take any book and place it in a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of such moves required to sort the books.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Indraneel has to sort the books in his library. His library has one long shelf. His books are numbered $1$ through $N$ and he wants to rearrange the books so that they appear in the sequence $1,2, ..., N$.
He intends to do this by a sequence of moves. In each move he can pick up any book from the shelf and insert it at a different place in the shelf. Suppose Indraneel has $5$ books and they are initially arranged in the order
21453214532 \quad 1 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
Indraneel will rearrange this in ascending order by first moving book $1$ to the beginning of the shelf to get
12453124531 \quad 2 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
Then, moving book $3$ to position $3$, he gets
12345123451 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5
Your task is to write a program to help Indraneel determine the minimum number of moves that are necessary to sort his book shelf.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input will contain a single integer $N$ indicating the number of books in Indraneel's library. This is followed by a line containing a permutation of $1, 2, ..., N$ indicating the intial state of Indraneel's book-shelf.

-----Output:-----
A single integer indicating the minimum number of moves necessary to sort Indraneel's book-shelf.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 200000$.
- You may also assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs, $1 \leq N \leq 5000$.

-----Sample Input-----
5

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [generation text] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The code does not include any mechanism to read input from standard input (stdin) or to print the output to standard output (stdout). This is crucial for the environment where the code is being executed, as it expects the program to handle input and output directly.

2. **Function Invocation**: The main function `minMovesToSort` is defined but never called. Without invoking this function, the program will not execute any logic, and thus no output will be produced.

3. **Input Parsing**: The input is provided as a list of strings, and the second line (the permutation of books) needs to be converted from a string to a list of integers. This conversion is missing in the current implementation.

4. **Output Format**: The expected output format is a single integer, but the code does not include any print statements to output the result.

### Where I Went Wrong:
- I focused on the logic for calculating the minimum moves but neglected the necessary input/output handling required for the environment.
- I did not include the invocation of the main function, which is essential for the program to run.
- I failed to convert the input string into the appropriate data type (list of integers) before processing.

### Next Steps:
To fix these issues, I will:
- Add input reading from standard input.
- Convert the input string into a list of integers.
- Call the `minMovesToSort` function with the parsed input.
- Print the output as required.

Here’s the corrected code:

```python
def binary_search(lis, book):
    # Implement binary search to find the correct position
    left, right = 0, len(lis)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if lis[mid] < book:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
    return left

def minMovesToSort(N, books):
    # Create a list to store the longest increasing subsequence
    lis = []
    
    for book in books:
        # Use binary search to find the position to replace or extend the LIS
        pos = binary_search(lis, book)
        if pos < len(lis):
            lis[pos] = book  # Replace the element
        else:
            lis.append(book)  # Extend the LIS
    
    # The minimum moves required is total books minus the length of LIS
    return N - len(lis)

# Read input
N = int(input().strip())
books = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

# Calculate and print the result
print(minMovesToSort(N, books))
``` 

This code now correctly handles input and output, ensuring it will work in the specified environment.

   Indraneel has a collection of books numbered from 1 to N, arranged in a certain order. He wants to rearrange them in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can take any book and place it in a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of such moves required to sort the books.

2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: 
   To solve this problem, we can identify the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement of books. The reason for this is that the books that are already in the correct order (part of the LIS) do not need to be moved. Therefore, the minimum number of moves required to sort the shelf will be the total number of books minus the length of the LIS. This approach is efficient and allows us to minimize the number of moves.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function minMovesToSort(N, books):
       # Create a list to store the longest increasing subsequence
       lis = []
       
       for book in books:
           # Use binary search to find the position to replace or extend the LIS
           pos = binary_search(lis, book)
           if pos < len(lis):
               lis[pos] = book  # Replace the element
           else:
               lis.append(book)  # Extend the LIS
       
       # The minimum moves required is total books minus the length of LIS
       return N - len(lis)

   function binary_search(lis, book):
       # Implement binary search to find the correct position
       left, right = 0, len(lis)
       while left < right:
           mid = (left + right) // 2
           if lis[mid] < book:
               left = mid + 1
           else:
               right = mid
       return left
   ```

4. **Final Python Solution**:
```python
def binary_search(lis, book):
    # Implement binary search to find the correct position
    left, right = 0, len(lis)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if lis[mid] < book:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The code does not include any mechanism to read input from standard input (stdin) or to print the output to standard output (stdout). This is crucial for the environment where the code is being executed, as it expects the program to handle input and output directly.

2. **Function Invocation**: The main function `minMovesToSort` is defined but never called. Without invoking this function, the program will not execute any logic, and thus no output will be produced.

3. **Input Parsing**: The input is provided as a list of strings, and the second line (the permutation of books) needs to be converted from a string to a list of integers. This conversion is missing in the current implementation.

4. **Output Format**: The expected output format is a single integer, but the code does not include any print statements to output the result.

### Where I Went Wrong:
- I focused on the logic for calculating the minimum moves but neglected the necessary input/output handling required for the environment.
- I did not include the invocation of the main function, which is essential for the program to run.
- I failed to convert the input string into the appropriate data type (list of integers) before processing.

### Next Steps:
To fix these issues, I will:
- Add input reading from standard input.
- Convert the input string into a list of integers.
- Call the `minMovesToSort` function with the parsed input.
- Print the output as required.

Here’s the corrected code:

```python
def binary_search(lis, book):
    # Implement binary search to find the correct position
    left, right = 0, len(lis)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if lis[mid] < book:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
    return left

def minMovesToSort(N, books):
    # Create a list to store the longest increasing subsequence
    lis = []
    
    for book in books:
        # Use binary search to find the position to replace or extend the LIS
        pos = binary_search(lis, book)
        if pos < len(lis):
            lis[pos] = book  # Replace the element
        else:
            lis.append(book)  # Extend the LIS
    
    # The minimum moves required is total books minus the length of LIS
    return N - len(lis)

# Read input
N = int(input().strip())
books = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

# Calculate and print the result
print(minMovesToSort(N, books))
``` 

This code now correctly handles input and output, ensuring it will work in the specified environment.

[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of determining the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock after a series of smashes, I identified that the core concept revolves around partitioning the weights of the rocks. The goal is to minimize the difference between two groups of weights, which can be approached using dynamic programming.

    The strategy involved calculating the total weight of the rocks and then using a dynamic programming array to track achievable sums up to half of the total weight. By iterating through each rock and updating the DP array, I was able to determine the largest sum that could be formed without exceeding the target. The final result is derived from the total weight minus twice this sum.

    The implemented solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating that the approach of using dynamic programming to solve a subset sum-like problem was effective. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
            total_weight = sum(stones)
            target = total_weight // 2
            dp = [False] * (target + 1)
            dp[0] = True

            for stone in stones:
                for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):
                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]

            for j in range(target, -1, -1):
                if dp[j]:
                    return total_weight - 2 * j
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in problems and applying dynamic programming techniques to optimize solutions.

[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of finding the maximum number of indices that can be visited in an array based on specific jump conditions, I initially implemented a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The main challenge was ensuring that the jump validity checks were correctly implemented, particularly the conditions that required the starting index's value to be greater than the destination index's value and all intermediate values.

    The first attempts failed due to incorrect handling of the jump conditions, leading to undercounting the maximum indices visited. The use of a visited set was appropriate, but it did not account for all valid paths effectively. The solution was improved by introducing a dynamic programming (DP) array to store results of previously computed indices, which significantly reduced redundant calculations.

    The final solution involved a DFS function that checks both left and right jumps within the allowed distance `d`, ensuring that all conditions for valid jumps were met. The use of memoization with the DP array allowed for efficient computation, ultimately passing all test cases.

    Key code snippet for the final solution:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def maxJumps(self, arr: list[int], d: int) -> int:
            n = len(arr)
            dp = [-1] * n  # To store the maximum jumps from each index
        
            def dfs(index):
                if dp[index] != -1:
                    return dp[index]  # Return already computed result
            
                max_count = 1  # Count the current index
            
                # Check jumps to the right
                for x in range(1, d + 1):
                    if index + x < n and arr[index] > arr[index + x]:
                        if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index + 1, index + x + 1)):
                            max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index + x))
            
                # Check jumps to the left
                for x in range(1, d + 1):
                    if index - x >= 0 and arr[index] > arr[index - x]:
                        if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index - 1, index - x - 1, -1)):
                            max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index - x))
            
                dp[index] = max_count  # Store the result
                return max_count

            max_jumps = 0
            for index in range(n):
                max_jumps = max(max_jumps, dfs(index))  # Update max jumps
            return max_jumps
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully validating conditions in recursive algorithms and the utility of memoization in optimizing performance.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    In reflecting on my attempts to solve the problem, I learned several key insights about the approach to tackling this type of jumping index problem. 

    ### Key Insights:
    1. **Dynamic Programming with Stack**: The official solution utilizes a dynamic programming approach combined with a stack to efficiently track the indices of the array. This allows for quick access to previous indices that can be jumped to, based on the conditions specified.

    2. **Handling Equal Heights**: The official solution effectively manages cases where multiple indices have the same height. By using a list to store indices of the same height, it ensures that all potential jumps are considered without missing any valid paths.

    3. **Boundary Conditions**: The solution cleverly adds a sentinel value (a very large number) to the end of the array. This helps in simplifying the logic for determining valid jumps, as it ensures that all indices are processed without needing additional boundary checks.

    4. **Efficiency**: The use of a stack allows the solution to maintain a time complexity of O(n), as each index is pushed and popped from the stack at most once. This is a significant improvement over the recursive DFS approach, which can lead to redundant calculations and higher time complexity.

    ### Comparison with My Approach:
    - My initial approach relied on a recursive DFS method with memoization, which, while functional, was less efficient due to the potential for redundant calculations and the complexity of managing the jump conditions.
    - The official solution's use of a stack to manage jumps and the handling of equal heights provided a more streamlined and efficient way to solve the problem.

    ### Conclusion:
    The official solution demonstrates a more effective strategy for solving the problem by leveraging dynamic programming and stack data structures. This experience highlights the importance of considering different data structures and algorithms when approaching complex problems, particularly those involving conditions and constraints on jumps or movements.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Indraneel has to sort the books in his library. His library has one long shelf. His books are numbered $1$ through $N$ and he wants to rearrange the books so that they appear in the sequence $1,2, ..., N$.
He intends to do this by a sequence of moves. In each move he can pick up any book from the shelf and insert it at a different place in the shelf. Suppose Indraneel has $5$ books and they are initially arranged in the order
21453214532 \quad 1 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
Indraneel will rearrange this in ascending order by first moving book $1$ to the beginning of the shelf to get
12453124531 \quad 2 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
Then, moving book $3$ to position $3$, he gets
12345123451 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5
Your task is to write a program to help Indraneel determine the minimum number of moves that are necessary to sort his book shelf.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input will contain a single integer $N$ indicating the number of books in Indraneel's library. This is followed by a line containing a permutation of $1, 2, ..., N$ indicating the intial state of Indraneel's book-shelf.

-----Output:-----
A single integer indicating the minimum number of moves necessary to sort Indraneel's book-shelf.

-----Constraints:-----

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [prompt] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: 
   Indraneel has a collection of books numbered from 1 to N, arranged in a certain order. He wants to rearrange them in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can take any book and place it in a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of such moves required to sort the books.

2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: 
   To solve this problem, we can identify the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement of books. The reason for this is that the books that are already in the correct order (part of the LIS) do not need to be moved. Therefore, the minimum number of moves required to sort the shelf will be the total number of books minus the length of the LIS. This approach is efficient and allows us to minimize the number of moves.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The code does not include any mechanism to read input from standard input (stdin) or to print the output to standard output (stdout). This is crucial for the environment where the code is being executed, as it expects the program to handle input and output directly.

2. **Function Invocation**: The main function `minMovesToSort` is defined but never called. Without invoking this function, the program will not execute any logic, and thus no output will be produced.

3. **Input Parsing**: The input is provided as a list of strings, and the second line (the permutation of books) needs to be converted from a string to a list of integers. This conversion is missing in the current implementation.

4. **Output Format**: The expected output format is a single integer, but the code does not include any print statements to output the result.

### Where I Went Wrong:
- I focused on the logic for calculating the minimum moves but neglected the necessary input/output handling required for the environment.
- I did not include the invocation of the main function, which is essential for the program to run.
- I failed to convert the input string into the appropriate data type (list of integers) before processing.

### Next Steps:
To fix these issues, I will:
- Add input reading from standard input.
- Convert the input string into a list of integers.
- Call the `minMovesToSort` function with the parsed input.
- Print the output as required.

Here’s the corrected code:

```python
def binary_search(lis, book):
    # Implement binary search to find the correct position
    left, right = 0, len(lis)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

            left = mid + 1

            right = mid

# Read input

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the total number of books `N` and the current arrangement of books from standard input.
2. **Binary Search Function**: The `binary_search` function is used to find the position in the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) where the current book can be placed or replace an existing book.
3. **Main Logic**: The `minMovesToSort` function calculates the length of the LIS and determines the minimum number of moves required to sort the books by subtracting the length of the LIS from the total number of books.
4. **Output**: Finally, the result is printed to standard output.

This code should now work correctly in the specified environment and pass all tests.

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a permutation of books numbered from 1 to N. The key insight was to leverage the concept of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). The minimum moves needed to sort the books can be calculated as the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.

Initially, the solution focused on the logic for calculating the LIS but failed to include necessary input/output handling, which is crucial for execution in a competitive programming environment. The main issues were the lack of input reading, the absence of function invocation, and the failure to convert input strings into the appropriate data types.

The final solution involved defining a binary search function to efficiently find positions in the LIS and a main function to compute the minimum moves. The corrected code successfully handled input and output, ensuring it worked as expected in the testing environment.

Here’s the final working code snippet for reference:

```python
def binary_search(lis, book):
    left, right = 0, len(lis)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if lis[mid] < book:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
    return left

def minMovesToSort(N, books):

    return N - len(lis)

N = int(input().strip())
books = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

```

This experience reinforced the importance of considering input/output requirements in coding challenges and highlighted the effectiveness of using LIS to solve sorting problems efficiently.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Indraneel has to sort the books in his library. His library has one long shelf. His books are numbered $1$ through $N$ and he wants to rearrange the books so that they appear in the sequence $1,2, ..., N$.
He intends to do this by a sequence of moves. In each move he can pick up any book from the shelf and insert it at a different place in the shelf. Suppose Indraneel has $5$ books and they are initially arranged in the order
21453214532 \quad 1 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
Indraneel will rearrange this in ascending order by first moving book $1$ to the beginning of the shelf to get
12453124531 \quad 2 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
Then, moving book $3$ to position $3$, he gets
12345123451 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5
Your task is to write a program to help Indraneel determine the minimum number of moves that are necessary to sort his book shelf.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input will contain a single integer $N$ indicating the number of books in Indraneel's library. This is followed by a line containing a permutation of $1, 2, ..., N$ indicating the intial state of Indraneel's book-shelf.

-----Output:-----
A single integer indicating the minimum number of moves necessary to sort Indraneel's book-shelf.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 200000$.
- You may also assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs, $1 \leq N \leq 5000$.

-----Sample Input-----
5
2 1 4 5 3 

-----Sample Output-----

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [prompt] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: 
   Indraneel has a collection of books numbered from 1 to N, arranged in a certain order. He wants to rearrange them in ascending order using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can take any book and place it in a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine the minimum number of such moves required to sort the books.

2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: 
   To solve this problem, we can identify the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement of books. The reason for this is that the books that are already in the correct order (part of the LIS) do not need to be moved. Therefore, the minimum number of moves required to sort the shelf will be the total number of books minus the length of the LIS. This approach is efficient and allows us to minimize the number of moves.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function minMovesToSort(N, books):
       # Create a list to store the longest increasing subsequence
       lis = []
       
       for book in books:
           # Use binary search to find the position to replace or extend the LIS
           pos = binary_search(lis, book)
           if pos < len(lis):
               lis[pos] = book  # Replace the element
           else:
               lis.append(book)  # Extend the LIS
       
       # The minimum moves required is total books minus the length of LIS
       return N - len(lis)

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [generation text] In reflecting on my attempts to solve the problem, I recognize that my approach was fundamentally sound but lacked efficiency in terms of time complexity. My solution utilized a binary search method to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS), which is generally efficient. However, the official solution employs a simpler dynamic programming approach that, while potentially less efficient in terms of time complexity (O(N^2)), is straightforward and easier to understand.

The official solution first checks if the array is already sorted. If it is, it immediately returns 0, which is a good optimization. If not, it initializes a list `l` to keep track of the lengths of increasing subsequences. The nested loops then iterate through the array to build the LIS by comparing each element with all previous elements. The final output is derived by subtracting the length of the longest increasing subsequence from the total number of books, which gives the minimum number of moves required.

Key insights from the official solution:
1. **Early Exit for Sorted Input**: Checking if the array is already sorted can save unnecessary computations.
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The use of a simple nested loop to build the LIS is effective for smaller inputs and is easier to implement and understand.
3. **Simplicity Over Complexity**: Sometimes, a simpler solution can be more effective, especially when the input size is manageable.

In future problems, I will consider both the efficiency and clarity of my solutions, and I will also look for opportunities to optimize early exits when possible.

This effectively gives the number of books that are out of order and need to be moved. The function returns this minimum number of moves needed to sort the books.

[Problem]
    Indraneel has to sort the books in his library. His library has one long shelf. His books are numbered $1$ through $N$ and he wants to rearrange the books so that they appear in the sequence $1,2, ..., N$.
    He intends to do this by a sequence of moves. In each move he can pick up any book from the shelf and insert it at a different place in the shelf. Suppose Indraneel has $5$ books and they are initially arranged in the order
    21453214532 \quad 1 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
    Indraneel will rearrange this in ascending order by first moving book $1$ to the beginning of the shelf to get
    12453124531 \quad 2 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
    Then, moving book $3$ to position $3$, he gets
    12345123451 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5
    Your task is to write a program to help Indraneel determine the minimum number of moves that are necessary to sort his book shelf.

    -----Input:-----
    The first line of the input will contain a single integer $N$ indicating the number of books in Indraneel's library. This is followed by a line containing a permutation of $1, 2, ..., N$ indicating the intial state of Indraneel's book-shelf.

    -----Output:-----
    A single integer indicating the minimum number of moves necessary to sort Indraneel's book-shelf.

    -----Constraints:-----
    - $1 \leq N \leq 200000$.
    - You may also assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs, $1 \leq N \leq 5000$.

    -----Sample Input-----
    5
    2 1 4 5 3 

    -----Sample Output-----
    2

        # The minimum moves required is total books minus the length of LIS
