## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared $p$ different sets of questions (numbered $0$ through $p-1$), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:
- The students are assigned roll numbers â€” pairwise distinct positive integers.
- If a student's roll number is $r$, this student gets the $((r-1)\%p)$-th set of questions.
Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.
You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: $A$ and $B$ respectively. Find the number of values of $p$ for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line â€” the number of values of $p$ for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le A, B \le 10^8$

-----Example Input-----
1
2 6

-----Example Output-----
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: They can cheat for $p = 1$, $p = 2$ or $p = 4$.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Ram and Shyam have distinct roll numbers, and they receive different sets of questions based on their roll numbers. We need to determine how many different values of `p` (the number of question sets) allow them to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the values of `p` for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, we need to check when the modulo operation on their roll numbers results in the same value. This can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   (A - 1) \% p = (B - 1) \% p
   \]
   This can be simplified to:
   \[
   (A - B) \% p = 0
   \]
   This means that `p` must be a divisor of the absolute difference between `A` and `B`. If `A` equals `B`, they will always receive the same set of questions for any positive `p`, leading to an infinite number of values. If `A` is not equal to `B`, we can find the number of divisors of the absolute difference.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_divisors(n):
       count = 0
       for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
           if n % i == 0:
               count += 1
               if i != n / i:
                   count += 1
       return count

   function find_cheating_values(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           A, B = test_case
           if A == B:
               print(-1)
           else:
               difference = abs(A - B)
               divisors_count = count_divisors(difference)
               print(divisors_count)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python

    # Initialize count of divisors
    count = 0

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the problems created by his setters, the number of problems needed for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the available days to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging simple loops and arithmetic.

    The final implementation was clean and efficient, successfully passing all provided test cases. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all edge cases (like having fewer problems than needed for a single contest) are considered. The solution was implemented without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints given. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def max_contests(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    max_contests(T)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of clear problem understanding and systematic solution development.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element by its index any number of times. The key insight was that the total sum of the sequence must be less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, and it must also be non-negative to reach zero.

    Initially, the solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it could always be made zero. This was a flawed assumption because it did not account for the possibility of the total sum being negative, which would make it impossible to reach zero.

    The corrected approach involved:
    1. Calculating the total sum of the sequence.
    2. Calculating the maximum reduction possible using the formula for the sum of the first `N` natural numbers.
    3. Checking both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction and must be non-negative.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
            total_sum = sum(A)
            max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))
        
            if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    can_make_good_sequence(T)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all conditions that affect the outcome, especially when dealing with sums and reductions.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the most frequently occurring largest prime factor from a list of integers across multiple test cases. The solution involved determining the largest prime factor for each integer and counting their occurrences.

    Key concepts included:
    - Efficiently finding the largest prime factor using trial division, which involved checking divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) and then moving to odd numbers.
    - Using a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each largest prime factor encountered.

    The implemented solution successfully handled the input and output requirements, and it passed the provided test case. The code structure was clear, with a dedicated function for finding the largest prime factor and a main function to manage input and output.

    The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python

        largest_prime = 1
        while n % 2 == 0:

            n //= 2
        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
            while n % i == 0:
                largest_prime = i
                n //= i
        if n > 2:
            largest_prime = n
        return largest_prime

            for element in elements:
                largest_factor = largest_prime_factor(element)
                if largest_factor in frequency:
                    frequency[largest_factor] += 1
                else:
                    frequency[largest_factor] = 1
        
            max_count = 0
            result = 0
            for prime, count in frequency.items():
                if count > max_count or (count == max_count and prime > result):
                    max_count = count
                    result = prime
        
            print(result)

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of efficient algorithms for prime factorization and the utility of dictionaries for counting occurrences in competitive programming tasks.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Ram and Shyam have distinct roll numbers, and they receive exam question sets based on their roll numbers. The question set they receive is determined by the formula `((roll_number - 1) % p)`, where `p` is the total number of different question sets. We need to find out how many values of `p` allow both Ram and Shyam to receive the same question set. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To determine the values of `p` for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, we need to ensure that the results of the modulo operation for both their roll numbers are equal. This leads us to the equation:
   ```
   (A - 1) % p == (B - 1) % p
   ```
   This can be simplified to:
   ```
   (A - B) % p == 0
   ```
   This means that `p` must be a divisor of the absolute difference between their roll numbers, `|A - B|`. If `A` equals `B`, then they can cheat for any positive integer `p`, leading to an infinite number of values. Otherwise, we need to count the divisors of `|A - B|`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   (A - 1) % p == (B - 1) % p
   ```
   This can be simplified to:
   ```
   (A - B) % p == 0
   ```
   This means that `p` must be a divisor of the absolute difference between their roll numbers, `|A - B|`. If `A` equals `B`, then they can cheat for any positive integer `p`, leading to an infinite number of values. Otherwise, we need to count the divisors of `|A - B|`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_divisors(n):
       count = 0
       for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
           if n % i == 0:
               count += 1
               if i != n / i:
                   count += 1
       return count

   function main():
       read integer T
       for each test case:
           read integers A and B
           if A == B:
               print -1

               difference = abs(A - B)

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] In this problem, the key concept revolves around determining the number of divisors of the absolute difference between two roll numbers, A and B. The main insight is that Ram and Shyam can cheat if the modulo operation results for their roll numbers are equal, which translates to finding divisors of `|A - B|`.

The solution involves two main functions: one for counting the divisors of a number and another for processing multiple test cases. The divisor counting function iterates up to the square root of the number, checking for divisibility and counting both the divisor and its complement when applicable.

The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the provided test cases, including the edge case where A equals B, which results in an infinite number of valid p values. The code is efficient due to the divisor counting method, which reduces the number of iterations significantly.

Key code snippet for counting divisors:
```python
def count_divisors(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical properties (like divisibility) in programming problems and how to efficiently implement solutions based on those properties.

    if diff/i==i:
     count+=1 
    else:
     count+=2
  print(count)

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem by leveraging the properties of divisors and bitwise operations. The key insights from the official solution include:

1. **Bitwise Comparison for Equality**: The use of `if not(A^B)` is a clever way to check if `A` and `B` are equal. The XOR operation (`^`) will yield zero if both numbers are the same, which simplifies the equality check.

2. **Efficient Divisor Counting**: The solution counts the divisors of the absolute difference `diff = abs(A - B)` by iterating only up to the square root of `diff`. This is efficient because divisors come in pairs, and checking up to the square root reduces the number of iterations significantly.

3. **Handling Perfect Squares**: The solution correctly accounts for perfect squares by checking if `diff / i` equals `i` to avoid double counting.

4. **Output**: The solution directly prints the results for each test case, which is straightforward and efficient.

In my initial approach, I followed a similar logic but did not utilize the bitwise operation for equality checking, which could have made the code slightly more concise. Additionally, the official solution's structure is more compact and avoids unnecessary variable assignments, which enhances readability and efficiency.

Overall, the official solution is a solid implementation that effectively combines mathematical properties with efficient programming techniques. It serves as a reminder to consider alternative methods for equality checks and to optimize loops when counting divisors.

    - The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, print a single line â€” the number of values of $p$ for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such values.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le T \le 100$
    - $1 \le A, B \le 10^8$

    -----Example Input-----
    1
    2 6

    -----Example Output-----
    3

    -----Explanation-----
    Example case 1: They can cheat for $p = 1$, $p = 2$ or $p = 4$.
