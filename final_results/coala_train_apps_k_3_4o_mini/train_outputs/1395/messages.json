We need to determine how many different values of `p` (the number of question sets) allow them to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return -1.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To find the values of `p` for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, we need to check when the modulo operation on their roll numbers results in the same value. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n   \\[\n   (A - 1) \\% p = (B - 1) \\% p\n   \\]\n   This can be simplified to:\n   \\[\n   (A - B) \\% p = 0\n   \\]\n   This means that `p` must be a divisor of the absolute difference between `A` and `B`. If `A` equals `B`, they will always receive the same set of questions for any positive `p`, leading to an infinite number of values. If `A` is not equal to `B`, we can find the number of divisors of the absolute difference.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_divisors(n):\n       count = 0\n       for i from 1 to sqrt(n):\n           if n % i == 0:\n               count += 1\n               if i != n / i:\n                   count += 1\n       return count\n\n   function find_cheating_values(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           A, B = test_case\n           if A == B:\n               print(-1)\n           else:\n               difference = abs(A - B)\n               divisors_count = count_divisors(difference)\n               print(divisors_count)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef count_divisors(n):\n    # Initialize count of divisors\n    count = 0\n    # Loop through all numbers from 1 to the square root of n\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:  # If i is a divisor\n            count += 1  # Count i\n            if i != n // i:  # If i and n/i are different\n                count += 1  # Count n/i as well\n    return count\n\ndef find_cheating_values(T, test_cases):\n    # Process each test case\n    for A, B in test_cases:\n        if A == B:\n            print(-1)  # Infinite values if A equals B\n        else:\n            difference = abs(A - B)  # Calculate the absolute difference\n            divisors_count = count_divisors(difference)  # Count divisors of the difference\n            print(divisors_count)  # Output the count of divisors\n\n# Read input\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(T)]\nfind_cheating_values(T, test_cases)\n```"

The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the available days to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging simple loops and arithmetic.\n\n    The final implementation was clean and efficient, successfully passing all provided test cases. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all edge cases (like having fewer problems than needed for a single contest) are considered. The solution was implemented without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints given. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_contests(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    max_contests(T)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of clear problem understanding and systematic solution development.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element by its index any number of times. The key insight was that the total sum of the sequence must be less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, and it must also be non-negative to reach zero.\n\n    Initially, the solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it could always be made zero. This was a flawed assumption because it did not account for the possibility of the total sum being negative, which would make it impossible to reach zero.\n\n    The corrected approach involved:\n    1. Calculating the total sum of the sequence.\n    2. Calculating the maximum reduction possible using the formula for the sum of the first `N` natural numbers.\n    3. Checking both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction and must be non-negative.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total_sum = sum(A)\n            max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))\n        \n            if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    can_make_good_sequence(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all conditions that affect the outcome, especially when dealing with sums and reductions.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to find the most frequently occurring largest prime factor from a list of integers across multiple test cases. The solution involved determining the largest prime factor for each integer and counting their occurrences.\n\n    Key concepts included:\n    - Efficiently finding the largest prime factor using trial division, which involved checking divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) and then moving to odd numbers.\n    - Using a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each largest prime factor encountered.\n\n    The implemented solution successfully handled the input and output requirements, and it passed the provided test case. The code structure was clear, with a dedicated function for finding the largest prime factor and a main function to manage input and output.\n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def largest_prime_factor(n):\n        largest_prime = 1\n        while n % 2 == 0:\n            largest_prime = 2\n            n //= 2\n        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n            while n % i == 0:\n                largest_prime = i\n                n //= i\n        if n > 2:\n            largest_prime = n\n        return largest_prime\n\n    def main():\n        T = int(input())\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            elements = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            frequency = {}\n        \n            for element in elements:\n                largest_factor = largest_prime_factor(element)\n                if largest_factor in frequency:\n                    frequency[largest_factor] += 1\n                else:\n                    frequency[largest_factor] = 1\n        \n            max_count = 0\n            result = 0\n            for prime, count in frequency.items():\n                if count > max_count or (count == max_count and prime > result):\n                    max_count = count\n                    result = prime\n        \n            print(result)\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of efficient algorithms for prime factorization and the utility of dictionaries for counting occurrences in competitive programming tasks.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
