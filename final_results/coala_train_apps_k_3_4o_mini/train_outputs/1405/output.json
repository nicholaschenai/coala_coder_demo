    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   We need to determine how many sabotage levels reach exactly level 5 after a series of imposters have upgraded them. Each imposter can only upgrade a sabotage if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of their index and the sabotage index is equal to the imposter's index. We are given multiple test cases, each specifying a number \\( N \\), which represents both the number of imposters and the number of sabotages.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   Each sabotage can be upgraded by imposters whose indices are divisors of the sabotage index. To reach level 5, a sabotage must be upgraded by exactly 5 different imposters. This means we need to find the sabotages that have exactly 5 divisors. The only numbers that have exactly 5 divisors are of the form \\( p^4 \\) where \\( p \\) is a prime number. Therefore, we need to count how many such numbers exist up to \\( N \\).\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - For each test case:\n     - Initialize a count to zero.\n     - For each prime \\( p \\):\n       - Calculate \\( p^4 \\).\n       - If \\( p^4 \\) is less than or equal to \\( N \\), increment the count.\n       - If \\( p^4 \\) exceeds \\( N \\), break the loop.\n     - Output the count.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_sabotages_at_level_5(N):\n    # Function to find all primes up to a certain limit using the Sieve of Eratosthenes\n    def sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit):\n        is_prime = [True] * (limit + 1)\n        p = 2\n        while (p * p <= limit):\n            if (is_prime[p] == True):\n                for i in range(p * p, limit + 1, p):\n                    is_prime[i] = False\n            p += 1\n        return [p for p in range(2, limit + 1) if is_prime[p]]\n\n    # Calculate the maximum possible value of p such that p^4 <= N\n    max_p = int(N**0.25)  # p^4 <= N implies p <= N^(1/4)\n    primes = sieve_of_eratosthenes(max_p)  # Get all primes up to max_p\n\n    count = 0\n    for p in primes:\n        if p**4 <= N:\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            break  # No need to check further if p^4 exceeds N\n\n    return count\n\ndef main():\n    T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N\n        result = count_sabotages_at_level_5(N)  # Calculate the number of sabotages at level 5\n        print(result)  # Output the result\n\nmain()\n```",
