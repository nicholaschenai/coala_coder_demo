There are N imposters, and each imposter can increase the level of certain sabotages based on a condition involving the greatest common divisor (gcd). Specifically, the i-th imposter can increase the level of the x-th sabotage if the gcd of i and x equals i. We need to determine how many sabotages reach level 5 after all imposters have acted.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   Each sabotage can be upgraded by imposters whose indices are divisors of the sabotage's index. For a sabotage to reach level 5, it must be upgraded by 5 different imposters. This means that the index of the sabotage must have at least 5 distinct divisors. The number of distinct divisors of a number can be determined by its prime factorization. We need to find out how many numbers from 1 to N have at least 5 distinct divisors.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - For each test case:\n     - Initialize a counter for sabotages at level 5.\n     - Loop through numbers from 1 to N:\n       - For each number, calculate the number of distinct divisors.\n       - If the number of distinct divisors is 5 or more, increment the counter.\n     - Output the counter.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_sabotages_at_level_5(N):\n    # Function to count the number of distinct divisors of a number\n    def count_divisors(n):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                count += 1  # i is a divisor\n                if i != n // i:\n                    count += 1  # n // i is also a divisor\n        return count\n\n    # Initialize the count of sabotages at level 5\n    level_5_count = 0\n    \n    # Check each number from 1 to N\n    for x in range(1, N + 1):\n        if count_divisors(x) >= 5:\n            level_5_count += 1\n    \n    return level_5_count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        N = int(data[i])  # Read each N\n        results.append(count_sabotages_at_level_5(N))  # Calculate and store result\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# The main function will be called when the script is executed\n```"

Initially, I attempted to derive a formula for the series but mistakenly used an incorrect formula that did not correspond to the series, leading to incorrect outputs.\n\n    Upon analyzing the series, I identified that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, which led to the realization that the N'th term could be computed as the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares. The correct formula for the N'th term is:\n    - T(N) = (N-1) * N * (2(N-1) + 1) / 6\n\n    This formula was derived from the known formula for the sum of squares. After implementing this corrected formula, the code produced the expected results for all test cases.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(N):\n        if N == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1) // 6\n\n    def main():\n        T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N\n            result = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            print(result)  # Output the result\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring that the derived formulas are correct before implementation.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The task was to calculate the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to a given number \"N\" for multiple test cases. The solution involved identifying the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N, calculating the number of terms in the series of multiples of 10, and then using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to compute the result efficiently.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to work with arithmetic series and integer division to find multiples. The approach was straightforward: determine the largest multiple of 10, count how many multiples exist up to that point, and apply the sum formula. This method is efficient and avoids any potential issues with large numbers, as Python handles large integers natively.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, and the code was structured to read input, process each test case, and output results correctly. The key takeaway is the importance of understanding arithmetic series and how to leverage mathematical formulas for efficient computation, especially when dealing with potentially large inputs. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):\n        largest_multiple = (N // 10) * 10\n        number_of_terms = largest_multiple // 10\n        sum = (number_of_terms * (10 + largest_multiple)) // 2\n        return sum\n\n    def main():\n        T = int(input())\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)\n            print(result)\n\n    main()\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the value of mathematical insights in programming challenges, particularly in optimizing solutions for large input sizes.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to calculate the number of valid schedules for Chef's restaurant, where dishes must be served over \\(N\\) days with specific constraints: consecutive days must have different dishes, and the first and last dishes must also be different.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    1. **Understanding the Combinatorial Nature**: The problem required a combinatorial approach to count valid arrangements based on the number of days. The choices for each day depended on the previous day's choice, leading to a recursive pattern.\n\n    2. **Formulating the Correct Logic**:\n       - For \\(N = 2\\): The valid combinations are \\(4 \\times 3\\).\n       - For \\(N = 3\\): The valid combinations are \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 2\\).\n       - For \\(N \\geq 4\\): The correct formula should be \\(4 \\times 3^{(N-1)}\\) because:\n         - The first day has 4 choices.\n         - The second day has 3 choices.\n         - Each of the next \\(N-2\\) days has 3 choices.\n         - The last day must be different from the first dish, which is already accounted for in the choices.\n\n    ### Errors and Fixes:\n    - Initially, I miscalculated the formula for \\(N \\geq 4\\) by incorrectly considering the last dish's constraints. The correct approach was to ensure that the last dish is different from the first while maintaining the choices for the middle days.\n    - The final formula for \\(N \\geq 4\\) was adjusted to correctly reflect the choices available.\n\n    ### Final Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def calculate_schedules(N):\n        if N == 2:\n            return (4 * 3) % (10**9 + 7)\n        elif N == 3:\n            return (4 * 3 * 2) % (10**9 + 7)\n        else:\n            return (4 * 3 * (3 ** (N - 2))) % (10**9 + 7)\n\n    def main():\n        T = int(input())\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            result = calculate_schedules(N)\n            print(result)\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering constraints in combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accurately reflected in the formulas used.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
