## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
There are $N$ sabotages available in the game Among Us, initially all at level $0$. 
$N$ imposters are allotted the task to upgrade the level of the sabotages. 
The $i^{th}$ imposter $(1 \leq i \leq N)$ increases the level of $x^{th}$ sabotage $(1 \leq x \leq N)$ by one level  if $gcd(i,x)=i$.
You need to find the number of sabotages at LEVEL 5 after all the imposters have completed their tasks.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer $N$. 

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line the number of sabotages at LEVEL 5.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^{18}$

-----Sample Input:-----
1
6

-----Sample Output:-----
0

-----EXPLANATION:-----
The $1^{st}$ sabotage is at level $1$, the $2^{nd}$, $3^{rd}$ and $5^{th}$ sabotages are at level $2$, the $4^{th}$ sabotage is at level $3$ and the $6^{th}$ sabotage is at level $4$.
None of them reach level $5$. Hence the output is $0$.

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

INFO - [Task id] 1405 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a game with N sabotages, all starting at level 0. There are N imposters, and each imposter can increase the level of certain sabotages based on a condition involving the greatest common divisor (gcd). Specifically, the i-th imposter can increase the level of the x-th sabotage if the gcd of i and x equals i. We need to determine how many sabotages reach level 5 after all imposters have acted.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   Each sabotage can be upgraded by imposters whose indices are divisors of the sabotage's index. For a sabotage to reach level 5, it must be upgraded by 5 different imposters. This means that the index of the sabotage must have at least 5 distinct divisors. The number of distinct divisors of a number can be determined by its prime factorization. We need to find out how many numbers from 1 to N have at least 5 distinct divisors.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - For each test case:
     - Initialize a counter for sabotages at level 5.
     - Loop through numbers from 1 to N:
       - For each number, calculate the number of distinct divisors.
       - If the number of distinct divisors is 5 or more, increment the counter.
     - Output the counter.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def count_sabotages_at_level_5(N):
    # Function to count the number of distinct divisors of a number

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... for multiple test cases. Initially, I attempted to derive a formula for the series but mistakenly used an incorrect formula that did not correspond to the series, leading to incorrect outputs.

    Upon analyzing the series, I identified that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, which led to the realization that the N'th term could be computed as the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares. The correct formula for the N'th term is:
    - T(N) = (N-1) * N * (2(N-1) + 1) / 6

    This formula was derived from the known formula for the sum of squares. After implementing this corrected formula, the code produced the expected results for all test cases.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(N):
        if N == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1) // 6

    def main():
        T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N
            result = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            print(result)  # Output the result

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring that the derived formulas are correct before implementation.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    The task was to calculate the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to a given number "N" for multiple test cases. The solution involved identifying the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N, calculating the number of terms in the series of multiples of 10, and then using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to compute the result efficiently.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to work with arithmetic series and integer division to find multiples. The approach was straightforward: determine the largest multiple of 10, count how many multiples exist up to that point, and apply the sum formula. This method is efficient and avoids any potential issues with large numbers, as Python handles large integers natively.

    The final implementation was successful, and the code was structured to read input, process each test case, and output results correctly. The key takeaway is the importance of understanding arithmetic series and how to leverage mathematical formulas for efficient computation, especially when dealing with potentially large inputs. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):
        largest_multiple = (N // 10) * 10
        number_of_terms = largest_multiple // 10
        sum = (number_of_terms * (10 + largest_multiple)) // 2
        return sum

    def main():
        T = int(input())
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)
            print(result)

    main()
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the value of mathematical insights in programming challenges, particularly in optimizing solutions for large input sizes.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to calculate the number of valid schedules for Chef's restaurant, where dishes must be served over \(N\) days with specific constraints: consecutive days must have different dishes, and the first and last dishes must also be different.

    ### Key Insights:
    1. **Understanding the Combinatorial Nature**: The problem required a combinatorial approach to count valid arrangements based on the number of days. The choices for each day depended on the previous day's choice, leading to a recursive pattern.

    2. **Formulating the Correct Logic**:
       - For \(N = 2\): The valid combinations are \(4 \times 3\).
       - For \(N = 3\): The valid combinations are \(4 \times 3 \times 2\).
       - For \(N \geq 4\): The correct formula should be \(4 \times 3^{(N-1)}\) because:
         - The first day has 4 choices.
         - The second day has 3 choices.
         - Each of the next \(N-2\) days has 3 choices.
         - The last day must be different from the first dish, which is already accounted for in the choices.

    ### Errors and Fixes:
    - Initially, I miscalculated the formula for \(N \geq 4\) by incorrectly considering the last dish's constraints. The correct approach was to ensure that the last dish is different from the first while maintaining the choices for the middle days.
    - The final formula for \(N \geq 4\) was adjusted to correctly reflect the choices available.

    ### Final Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def calculate_schedules(N):
        if N == 2:
            return (4 * 3) % (10**9 + 7)
        elif N == 3:
            return (4 * 3 * 2) % (10**9 + 7)
        else:
            return (4 * 3 * (3 ** (N - 2))) % (10**9 + 7)

    def main():
        T = int(input())
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            result = calculate_schedules(N)
            print(result)

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering constraints in combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accurately reflected in the formulas used.

   We need to determine how many sabotage levels reach exactly level 5 after a series of imposters have upgraded them. Each imposter can only upgrade a sabotage if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of their index and the sabotage index is equal to the imposter's index. We are given multiple test cases, each specifying a number \( N \), which represents both the number of imposters and the number of sabotages.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   Each sabotage can be upgraded by imposters whose indices are divisors of the sabotage index. To reach level 5, a sabotage must be upgraded by exactly 5 different imposters. This means we need to find the sabotages that have exactly 5 divisors. The only numbers that have exactly 5 divisors are of the form \( p^4 \) where \( p \) is a prime number. Therefore, we need to count how many such numbers exist up to \( N \).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - For each test case:
     - Initialize a count to zero.
     - For each prime \( p \):
       - Calculate \( p^4 \).
       - If \( p^4 \) is less than or equal to \( N \), increment the count.

INFO - [Task id] 1405 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine how many sabotage levels reach exactly level 5 after a series of imposters have upgraded them. Each imposter can only upgrade a sabotage if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of their index and the sabotage index is equal to the imposter's index. We are given multiple test cases, each specifying a number \( N \), which represents both the number of imposters and the number of sabotages.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   Each sabotage can be upgraded by imposters whose indices are divisors of the sabotage index. To reach level 5, a sabotage must be upgraded by exactly 5 different imposters. This means we need to find the sabotages that have exactly 5 divisors. The only numbers that have exactly 5 divisors are of the form \( p^4 \) where \( p \) is a prime number. Therefore, we need to count how many such numbers exist up to \( N \).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - For each test case:
     - Initialize a count to zero.
     - For each prime \( p \):
       - Calculate \( p^4 \).
       - If \( p^4 \) is less than or equal to \( N \), increment the count.
       - If \( p^4 \) exceeds \( N \), break the loop.

INFO - [Task id] 1405 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine how many sabotages reach exactly level 5 after a series of imposters upgrade them based on the GCD condition. The key insight was that only numbers of the form \( p^4 \) (where \( p \) is a prime) have exactly 5 divisors. Thus, the solution involved counting how many such numbers exist up to \( N \).

The approach included implementing the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all primes up to \( N^{1/4} \) and then checking how many of these primes, when raised to the fourth power, are less than or equal to \( N \). This method was efficient given the constraints, especially since \( N \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \).

The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was sound, as evidenced by passing the provided test cases. The code snippet for the main logic is as follows:

```python
def count_sabotages_at_level_5(N):
    def sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit):
        is_prime = [True] * (limit + 1)
        p = 2
        while (p * p <= limit):
            if (is_prime[p] == True):
                for i in range(p * p, limit + 1, p):
                    is_prime[i] = False
            p += 1
        return [p for p in range(2, limit + 1) if is_prime[p]]

    max_p = int(N**0.25)
    primes = sieve_of_eratosthenes(max_p)

    count = 0
    for p in primes:
        if p**4 <= N:
            count += 1
        else:
            break

    return count
```

This experience reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical properties (like the divisor count) and leveraging efficient algorithms (like the Sieve of Eratosthenes) to solve problems within large constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 1405 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem by leveraging the properties of prime numbers and their powers. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Prime Generation**: The solution uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all prime numbers up to 32,000. This is efficient and allows for quick access to prime numbers needed for further calculations.

2. **Power Calculation**: After generating the list of primes, the solution computes \( p^4 \) for each prime \( p \) and stores these values in a list. This is crucial because only numbers of the form \( p^4 \) can have exactly 5 divisors.

3. **Binary Search for Efficiency**: The solution employs the `bisect` module to quickly count how many of these \( p^4 \) values are less than or equal to \( N \). This is a significant optimization, as it allows for rapid querying of the precomputed list of powers.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The solution is structured to handle multiple test cases efficiently, reading input once and processing each case in constant time after the initial setup.

### Reflection on My Approach:
My initial approach involved calculating the primes and their fourth powers dynamically for each test case, which is less efficient than precomputing them once and using binary search. The use of the Sieve of Eratosthenes is a strong point in the official solution, as it allows for a quick generation of primes up to a reasonable limit. 

Additionally, I did not consider the efficiency of using a binary search to count valid sabotages, which is a crucial optimization in handling large inputs. The official solution's method of precomputing and storing results allows it to handle the upper limits of the constraints effectively, while my approach would struggle with performance due to repeated calculations.

In future problems, I should focus on precomputation and efficient querying techniques, especially when dealing with large input sizes and multiple test cases.

    - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer $N$. 

    -----Output:-----
    For each testcase, output in a single line the number of sabotages at LEVEL 5.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
    - $1 \leq N \leq 10^{18}$

    -----Sample Input:-----
    1
    6

    -----Sample Output:-----
    0

    -----EXPLANATION:-----
    The $1^{st}$ sabotage is at level $1$, the $2^{nd}$, $3^{rd}$ and $5^{th}$ sabotages are at level $2$, the $4^{th}$ sabotage is at level $3$ and the $6^{th}$ sabotage is at level $4$.
    None of them reach level $5$. Hence the output is $0$.
