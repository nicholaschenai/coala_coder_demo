You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
- 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
- -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

-----Example-----
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2
2 3 4 -1
1 1 2

Output:
3
4

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a series of hills, each with a specific height. Participants in a competition will jump from one hill to another based on certain rules. They can either query where they will end up after a series of jumps or modify the heights of a range of hills. The jumps can only go to the nearest hill to the right that is taller, and if there are no such hills within a distance of 100, they stay on the current hill.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will maintain a list of hill heights.
   - For each query of type 1, we will start from the specified hill and attempt to jump up to `k` times, checking the heights of the hills to the right to find the next valid jump.
   - For each query of type 2, we will update the heights of the specified range of hills by adding a given value.
   - We need to ensure that the jumps respect the distance constraint of 100 hills.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize a list of hill heights from input
   For each operation:
       If operation type is 1:
           Set current position to i-1 (0-indexed)
           For j from 0 to k-1:
               Find the next hill to jump to:
                   For each hill from current position + 1 to current position + 100:
                       If hill index is out of bounds, break
                       If height of hill is greater than height of current position:
                           Update current position to this hill index
                           Break
               If no valid jump found, break
           Output the final position (current position + 1 for 1-indexing)
       Else if operation type is 2:
           Update the heights of hills from L-1 to R-1 by adding X
   ```

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.

- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        In ChefLand, there is a mountain range consisting of $N$ hills (numbered $1$ through $N$) in a straight line. Let's denote the height of the $i$-th hill from the left by $h_i$.
        Ada is working on the water supply system of ChefLand. On some of the hills, she wants to place water reservoirs; then, for each reservoir, she will decide in which direction the water should flow from it â€” either to the left or to the right (water may not flow in both directions from the same reservoir). From a reservoir on a hill with height $h$, water flows in the chosen direction until it reaches the first hill that is strictly higher than $h$; all hills before this hill (including the hill containing the reservoir) are therefore supplied with water.
        For example, suppose we have hills with heights $[7, 2, 3, 5, 8]$. If we place a reservoir on the hill with height $5$, and pump water from it to the left, then the hills with heights $2$, $3$ and $5$ are supplied with water.
        Help Ada find the minimum numer of reservoirs needed to provide water to all the hills if she chooses the directions optimally.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
        - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
        - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_N$.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum required number of reservoirs.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $2 \le N \le 10^5$
        - $1 \le h_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
        - $h_i \neq h_j $ for any valid $i \neq j$
        - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$

        -----Example Input-----
        1
        6
        4 16 32 6 8 2

        -----Example Output-----
        2    

        -----Explanation-----
        Example case 1: We can place reservoirs on the second and third hill, pumping water to the left and right respectively.

    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restatement of the Problem**:
           The problem involves a series of hills with varying heights, and we need to determine the minimum number of water reservoirs required to ensure that all hills receive water. Water can flow from a reservoir in one direction until it reaches a taller hill, at which point it stops. The goal is to strategically place reservoirs and choose their flow direction to minimize the total number of reservoirs used.

        2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**:
           To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will iterate through the list of hills and determine the optimal placement of reservoirs. For each hill, we will check if it can be supplied with water from a previously placed reservoir. If it cannot, we will place a new reservoir. We will also keep track of the last placed reservoir and its height to decide the direction of water flow.

        3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
           ```
           function min_reservoirs(T):
               for each test case:
                   read N
                   read heights list
                   initialize reservoirs_count to 0
                   initialize last_height to -1
           
                   for each height in heights:
                       if height > last_height:
                           increment reservoirs_count
                           update last_height to height
           
                   print reservoirs_count

           read T
           min_reservoirs(T)
           ```

        4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
        ```python
        def min_reservoirs(T):
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(input())
                heights = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
                reservoirs_count = 0
                last_height = -1
        
                for height in heights:
                    if height > last_height:
                        reservoirs_count += 1
                        last_height = height
        
                print(reservoirs_count)

        T = int(input())
        min_reservoirs(T)
        ``` 

        In this solution:
        - We read the number of test cases.
        - For each test case, we read the number of hills and their respective heights.
        - We initialize a counter for reservoirs and a variable to track the last height of the placed reservoir.
        - We iterate through the heights, and whenever we find a height greater than the last placed reservoir's height, we increment the reservoir count and update the last height.
        - Finally, we print the total number of reservoirs needed for each test case.

    [Task]:
        In ChefLand, there is a mountain range consisting of $N$ hills (numbered $1$ through $N$) in a straight line. Let's denote the height of the $i$-th hill from the left by $h_i$.
        Ada is working on the water supply system of ChefLand. On some of the hills, she wants to place water reservoirs; then, for each reservoir, she will decide in which direction the water should flow from it â€” either to the left or to the right (water may not flow in both directions from the same reservoir). From a reservoir on a hill with height $h$, water flows in the chosen direction until it reaches the first hill that is strictly higher than $h$; all hills before this hill (including the hill containing the reservoir) are therefore supplied with water.
        For example, suppose we have hills with heights $[7, 2, 3, 5, 8]$. If we place a reservoir on the hill with height $5$, and pump water from it to the left, then the hills with heights $2$, $3$ and $5$ are supplied with water.
        Help Ada find the minimum numer of reservoirs needed to provide water to all the hills if she chooses the directions optimally.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
        - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
        - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_N$.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum required number of reservoirs.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $2 \le N \le 10^5$
        - $1 \le h_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
        - $h_i \neq h_j $ for any valid $i \neq j$
        - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$

        -----Example Input-----
        1
        6
        4 16 32 6 8 2

        -----Example Output-----
        2    

        -----Explanation-----
        Example case 1: We can place reservoirs on the second and third hill, pumping water to the left and right respectively.

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem and the previous solution step-by-step to identify the issues.

        1. **Understanding the Problem**:
           - We need to place reservoirs on hills such that each hill receives water either from a reservoir to its left or right.
           - Water flows from a reservoir until it hits a taller hill, at which point it stops.
           - The goal is to minimize the number of reservoirs used.

        2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
           - The previous solution only counted the number of hills that were taller than the last placed reservoir. This approach does not account for the fact that a reservoir can supply water to multiple hills in one direction until it hits a taller hill.
           - The logic should involve checking both left and right directions for each hill to determine if a reservoir is needed.

        3. **Correct Approach**:
           - We need to iterate through the hills and determine the optimal placement of reservoirs by checking both directions.
           - We can maintain two lists: one for the leftmost reservoirs and one for the rightmost reservoirs.
           - We will place a reservoir on a hill if it cannot be supplied by any previously placed reservoir in either direction.

        4. **Revised Pseudocode**:
           ```
           function min_reservoirs(T):
               for each test case:
                   read N
                   read heights list
                   initialize reservoirs_count to 0
                   initialize left_max and right_max to -1
           
                   # Check from left to right
                   for i from 0 to N-1:
                       if heights[i] > left_max:
                           increment reservoirs_count
                           update left_max to heights[i]
           
                   # Check from right to left
                   for i from N-1 to 0:
                       if heights[i] > right_max:
                           increment reservoirs_count
                           update right_max to heights[i]
           
                   print reservoirs_count

           read T
           min_reservoirs(T)
           ```

        5. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
        ```python
        def min_reservoirs(T):
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(input())
                heights = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
                reservoirs_count = 0
                left_max = -1
                right_max = -1
        
                # Check from left to right
                for i in range(N):
                    if heights[i] > left_max:
                        reservoirs_count += 1
                        left_max = heights[i]
        
                # Check from right to left
                for i in range(N-1, -1, -1):
                    if heights[i] > right_max:
                        reservoirs_count += 1
                        right_max = heights[i]
        
                # Since we counted reservoirs from both sides, we need to adjust the count
                # We can only count the unique reservoirs, so we need to subtract the overlap
                print(reservoirs_count)

        T = int(input())
        min_reservoirs(T)
        ```

        In this revised solution:
        - We check both directions for placing reservoirs.
        - We maintain two maximum heights to track the tallest hills encountered from both ends.
        - We count reservoirs based on the unique heights that can supply water to the hills.
        - Finally, we print the total number of reservoirs needed for each test case.
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Based on the insights gained from the previous attempts and the understanding of the problem, I will revise the solution to correctly determine the minimum number of reservoirs needed to supply water to all hills.

        ### Key Insights for the Correct Approach:
        1. **Reservoir Placement**: We need to place reservoirs such that each hill can be supplied with water either from the left or the right.
        2. **Tracking Heights**: We will track the maximum heights encountered as we traverse the hills from both directions.
        3. **Unique Reservoirs**: We need to ensure that we only count unique reservoirs that can supply water to the hills.

        ### Revised Python 3 Code:
        ```python
        def min_reservoirs(T):
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(input())
                heights = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
                reservoirs_count = 0
                left_max = -1
                right_max = -1
        
                # Check from left to right
                for i in range(N):
                    if heights[i] > left_max:
                        reservoirs_count += 1
                        left_max = heights[i]
        
                # Check from right to left
                for i in range(N-1, -1, -1):
                    if heights[i] > right_max:
                        reservoirs_count += 1
                        right_max = heights[i]
        
                # Since we counted reservoirs from both sides, we need to adjust the count
                # We can only count the unique reservoirs, so we need to subtract the overlap
                # The overlap occurs when a reservoir can supply water from both sides
                # We need to check if the last left_max and right_max are the same
                if left_max == right_max:
                    reservoirs_count -= 1
        
                print(reservoirs_count)

        T = int(input())
        min_reservoirs(T)
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code:
        - We read the number of test cases.
        - For each test case, we read the number of hills and their respective heights.
        - We initialize a counter for reservoirs and two variables to track the maximum heights encountered from both directions.
        - We iterate through the heights from left to right and count reservoirs whenever we find a height greater than the last maximum height.
        - We repeat the process from right to left.
        - Finally, we check for any overlap in the last maximum heights from both directions and adjust the count accordingly.
        - We print the total number of reservoirs needed for each test case.

        This approach ensures that we correctly account for the unique reservoirs needed to supply water to all hills while minimizing the total count.

        2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
           - The previous solution incorrectly counted reservoirs from both left to right and right to left without considering that a single reservoir can supply multiple hills in one direction.
           - The logic for adjusting the count based on overlaps was flawed. Simply checking if the last maximum heights from both directions are equal does not accurately reflect the number of unique reservoirs needed.

        3. **Correct Approach**:
           - We should only place a reservoir when a hill cannot be supplied by any previously placed reservoir in either direction.
           - We can use a single pass from left to right and another from right to left, but we need to ensure that we only count unique reservoirs that can supply water to hills that are not already supplied by another reservoir.

        4. **Revised Strategy**:
           - We will maintain a boolean list to track which hills are already supplied with water.
           - We will iterate through the hills from left to right and then from right to left, placing reservoirs only when necessary.

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**:
   The problem involves a series of hills with varying heights, and we need to determine the final position of a participant after a series of jumps. Each jump can only be made to the nearest hill to the right that is strictly taller than the current hill. If there is no such hill or if the distance to the next taller hill exceeds 100 hills, the participant remains on the current hill. Additionally, we can modify the heights of the hills within a specified range.

 1. **Restatement of the Problem**:
   The problem involves a series of hills with varying heights, and we need to determine the final position of a participant after a series of jumps. Each jump can only be made to the nearest hill to the right that is strictly taller than the current hill.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
- 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
- -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

-----Example-----
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2
2 3 4 -1
1 1 2

Output:
3
4

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] In this problem, the main challenge was to efficiently handle two types of operations on a list of hill heights: determining the final position after a series of jumps and updating the heights of a specified range. The core concept involved simulating the jumps based on the heights of the hills and ensuring that the jumps adhered to the constraints provided (i.e., jumping only to the nearest taller hill and not exceeding a distance of 100).

The solution involved iterating through the hills for each jump operation, which worked well within the constraints. The height update operation was straightforward, directly modifying the heights in the specified range. The implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic for both operations was clearly defined.

One key takeaway was the importance of efficiently checking conditions during the jump operation to avoid unnecessary iterations, especially given the potential size of the input (up to 100,000 hills and operations). The final implementation was effective, and the tests passed without any issues, indicating that the approach was sound. 

The code snippet for the solution is as follows:

```python
def find_final_hill(N, heights, operations):
    for operation in operations:
        if operation[0] == 1:  # Type 1 operation
            i = operation[1]
            k = operation[2]
            current_hill = i
            for jump in range(k):
                next_hill = current_hill + 1
                while next_hill <= N and (heights[next_hill - 1] <= heights[current_hill - 1] or next_hill - current_hill > 100):
                    next_hill += 1
                if next_hill > N:
                    break
                current_hill = next_hill
            print(current_hill)
        elif operation[0] == 2:  # Type 2 operation
            L = operation[1]
            R = operation[2]
            X = operation[3]
            for j in range(L - 1, R):
                heights[j] += X

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
- 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
- -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

-----Example-----
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2
2 3 4 -1
1 1 2

Output:
3
4

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 648 [prompt] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**:
   The problem involves a series of hills with varying heights, and we need to determine the final position of a participant after a series of jumps. Each jump can only be made to the nearest hill to the right that is strictly taller than the current hill. If there is no such hill or if the distance to the next taller hill exceeds 100 hills, the participant remains on the current hill. Additionally, we can modify the heights of the hills within a specified range.

2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**:
   To solve this problem, we will maintain the heights of the hills in a list. For each jump operation, we will check the heights of the hills to the right of the current hill to find the next taller hill. We will also handle the height modification operations by directly updating the heights in the specified range. The solution will involve iterating through the hills and performing the necessary checks for each jump.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function find_final_hill(N, heights, operations):
       for each operation in operations:
           if operation.type == 1:
               i = operation.i
               k = operation.k
               current_hill = i
               for jump in range(k):
                   next_hill = current_hill + 1
                   while next_hill <= N and (heights[next_hill - 1] <= heights[current_hill - 1] or next_hill - current_hill > 100):
                       next_hill += 1
                   if next_hill > N:
                       break
                   current_hill = next_hill
               print(current_hill)

               R = operation.R
               X = operation.X
               for j in range(L - 1, R):
                   heights[j] += X

   operations = []
   for each operation in Q:
       read operation details
       operations.append(operation)
   find_final_hill(N, heights, operations)
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:

operations = []

find_final_hill(N, heights, operations)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a function `find_final_hill` that takes the number of hills, their heights, and a list of operations.
- For each operation, if it's of type 1, we simulate the jumps from the specified hill and print the final position after the jumps.
- If it's of type 2, we update the heights of the specified range.
- The input is read, and the function is called to process the operations.

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem with a straightforward approach, focusing on the two types of operations required. Here are the key insights and comparisons with my initial solution:

1. **Input Handling**: The official solution reads input in a compact manner, using a single loop to process each operation. This is efficient and reduces the overhead of managing multiple lists or structures.

2. **Jump Logic**: The official solution uses a while loop to handle the jump logic, which checks both the height condition and the distance condition in a single pass. This is efficient as it avoids unnecessary iterations once a valid jump is found. My initial solution also implemented this logic but could be optimized further by directly checking the conditions without additional checks.

3. **Height Update**: The height update operation is handled in a simple loop, which is clear and effective. My solution also implemented this correctly, but the official solution's approach is more concise.

4. **Output Collection**: The official solution collects results in a list and prints them at the end, which is a good practice for performance, especially when dealing with a large number of operations. My solution printed results immediately, which could be less efficient in scenarios with many operations.

5. **Indexing**: The official solution carefully manages indexing, converting between 0-based and 1-based indexing as needed. This is crucial in Python, where lists are 0-indexed, while the problem statement uses 1-indexed hills.

Overall, the official solution is efficient and clear, effectively handling the problem's requirements. My approach was on the right track but could benefit from the official solution's concise handling of input and output, as well as its efficient jump logic. In future problems, I should focus on optimizing input/output handling and ensuring that my logic is as compact as possible while maintaining clarity.

    Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
    Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).

    -----Input-----
    - First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
    - Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
    - Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k.

    The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
    The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
    The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.
