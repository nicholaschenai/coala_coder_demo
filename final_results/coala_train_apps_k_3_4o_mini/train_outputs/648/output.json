    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**:\n   The problem involves a series of hills with varying heights, and we need to determine the final position of a participant after a series of jumps. Each jump can only be made to the nearest hill to the right that is strictly taller than the current hill. If there is no such hill or if the distance to the next taller hill exceeds 100 hills, the participant remains on the current hill. Additionally, we can modify the heights of the hills within a specified range.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**:\n   To solve this problem, we will maintain the heights of the hills in a list. For each jump operation, we will check the heights of the hills to the right of the current hill to find the next taller hill. We will also handle the height modification operations by directly updating the heights in the specified range. The solution will involve iterating through the hills and performing the necessary checks for each jump.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_final_hill(N, heights, operations):\n       for each operation in operations:\n           if operation.type == 1:\n               i = operation.i\n               k = operation.k\n               current_hill = i\n               for jump in range(k):\n                   next_hill = current_hill + 1\n                   while next_hill <= N and (heights[next_hill - 1] <= heights[current_hill - 1] or next_hill - current_hill > 100):\n                       next_hill += 1\n                   if next_hill > N:\n                       break\n                   current_hill = next_hill\n               print(current_hill)\n           else if operation.type == 2:\n               L = operation.L\n               R = operation.R\n               X = operation.X\n               for j in range(L - 1, R):\n                   heights[j] += X\n\n   read N and Q\n   read heights list\n   operations = []\n   for each operation in Q:\n       read operation details\n       operations.append(operation)\n   find_final_hill(N, heights, operations)\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef find_final_hill(N, heights, operations):\n    for operation in operations:\n        if operation[0] == 1:  # Type 1 operation\n            i = operation[1]\n            k = operation[2]\n            current_hill = i\n            for jump in range(k):\n                next_hill = current_hill + 1\n                while next_hill <= N and (heights[next_hill - 1] <= heights[current_hill - 1] or next_hill - current_hill > 100):\n                    next_hill += 1\n                if next_hill > N:\n                    break\n                current_hill = next_hill\n            print(current_hill)\n        elif operation[0] == 2:  # Type 2 operation\n            L = operation[1]\n            R = operation[2]\n            X = operation[3]\n            for j in range(L - 1, R):\n                heights[j] += X\n\n# Read input\nN, Q = map(int, input().split())\nheights = list(map(int, input().split()))\noperations = []\nfor _ in range(Q):\n    operations.append(list(map(int, input().split())))\n\nfind_final_hill(N, heights, operations)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- We define a function `find_final_hill` that takes the number of hills, their heights, and a list of operations.\n- For each operation, if it's of type 1, we simulate the jumps from the specified hill and print the final position after the jumps.\n- If it's of type 2, we update the heights of the specified range.\n- The input is read, and the function is called to process the operations.",
