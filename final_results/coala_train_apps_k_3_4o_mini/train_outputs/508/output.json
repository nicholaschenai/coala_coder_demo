    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   We have an infinitely long street represented as a number line, where there are several roadworks that block specific points for certain time intervals. People start walking from the origin (coordinate 0) at different times and will stop walking when they reach a blocked point. Our task is to determine how far each person can walk before they are stopped by a roadwork or if they can walk indefinitely.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   - First, we need to read the number of roadworks and their respective blocking intervals and positions.\n   - For each person, we will check their starting time and calculate the time they reach each blocked point.\n   - If a person reaches a blocked point during its blocking time, we record that distance. If they reach a point after the blocking has ended, they can continue walking.\n   - If they never encounter a blocked point, they can walk indefinitely, and we will return -1 for that person.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function calculate_distances(N, roadworks, Q, people):\n       sort roadworks by position\n       for each person in people:\n           initialize distance = -1\n           for each roadwork in roadworks:\n               if person starts walking at time D_i:\n                   time_to_reach = D_i + position of roadwork\n                   if time_to_reach is within the blocking time:\n                       distance = position of roadwork\n                       break\n           if distance is still -1:\n               return -1\n           else:\n               return distance\n\n   function main():\n       read N and Q\n       read roadworks\n       read people\n       calculate_distances(N, roadworks, Q, people)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef calculate_distances(N, roadworks, Q, people):\n    # Sort roadworks by their position\n    roadworks.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])  # Sort by X_i\n\n    results = []\n    for D in people:\n        distance = -1  # Default to -1 (walks indefinitely)\n        for S, T, X in roadworks:\n            # Calculate the time it takes for the person to reach the blocked point\n            time_to_reach = D + X\n            # Check if the person reaches the blocked point during its blocking time\n            if S <= time_to_reach < T:\n                distance = X  # They stop at this blocked point\n                break\n        results.append(distance)\n\n    # Print results for each person\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\ndef main():\n    # Read input\n    N, Q = map(int, input().split())\n    roadworks = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]\n    people = [int(input()) for _ in range(Q)]\n    \n    # Calculate distances for each person\n    calculate_distances(N, roadworks, Q, people)\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n```",
