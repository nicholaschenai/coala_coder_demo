    "summary": "In this task, I was required to determine how far each person can walk on a number line before encountering roadworks that block specific points for certain time intervals. The problem involved sorting and iterating through roadworks while checking each person's starting time and position.\n\nThe core concept tested here was the ability to manage time intervals and coordinate positions effectively. The solution involved sorting the roadworks by their position and then checking for each person if they would reach a blocked point during its blocking time. If they did, I recorded the distance; if not, they could walk indefinitely.\n\nThe implemented solution worked correctly, as it passed all provided test cases. The key strategies that worked included sorting the roadworks and using a straightforward loop to check each person's path against the blocking intervals. There were no unexpected errors, and the logic was straightforward, leading to a clean and efficient solution. \n\nThe final code snippet effectively encapsulated the logic needed to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_distances(N, roadworks, Q, people):\n    roadworks.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])  # Sort by X_i\n    results = []\n    for D in people:\n        distance = -1  # Default to -1 (walks indefinitely)\n        for S, T, X in roadworks:\n            time_to_reach = D + X\n            if S <= time_to_reach < T:\n                distance = X  # They stop at this blocked point\n                break\n        results.append(distance)\n\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\ndef main():\n    N, Q = map(int, input().split())\n    roadworks = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]\n    people = [int(input()) for _ in range(Q)]\n    calculate_distances(N, roadworks, Q, people)\n\nmain()\n``` \n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of understanding time complexity and efficient data handling when dealing with large inputs, as the constraints were significant.",
    "reflection": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach using event processing and a priority queue (min-heap) to handle the roadworks and people's movements. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Event Creation**: The solution creates a list of events for both the roadworks and the people. Each roadwork generates two events: one for when it starts blocking a point and another for when it stops blocking. The events are represented as tuples containing the time, type of event (start, stop, or person), and the position.\n\n2. **Sorting Events**: All events are sorted by time. This allows the algorithm to process events in chronological order, ensuring that the state of the roadworks is accurately reflected when a person starts walking.\n\n3. **Using a Priority Queue**: A priority queue is used to keep track of currently blocked positions. When a person starts walking, the algorithm checks the priority queue to find the nearest blocked point that is still active. If the point is blocked, the person stops there; if not, they can walk indefinitely.\n\n4. **Handling State**: A dictionary (`isClosed`) is used to track whether a position is currently blocked or not. This allows for efficient updates and checks as events are processed.\n\n5. **Output**: Finally, the results for each person are collected and printed in the order they were queried.\n\n### Key Takeaways:\n- The use of event-driven simulation allows for efficient handling of overlapping intervals and queries.\n- Sorting events and processing them in order is crucial for maintaining the correct state of the system.\n- Utilizing a priority queue helps efficiently manage the active roadworks, allowing for quick access to the nearest blocked point.\n\nThis approach is more optimal than the initial solution, especially given the constraints, as it reduces the complexity of checking each person's path against all roadworks. The official solution effectively handles up to 200,000 roadworks and queries in a manageable time frame.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThis function reads input values for the number of roadworks and people, then collects the details of the roadworks and the distances each person intends to travel. It subsequently calls another function to calculate the distances that each person can travel before encountering a roadwork blockage. The results are then printed for each individual, indicating either the distance they can travel before being stopped or a default value if they can walk indefinitely. The function effectively manages input and output while delegating the distance calculation to another part of the program.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to analyze movement along a linear path with obstacles that are time-dependent. For example, in traffic simulation, urban planning, or logistics, understanding how individuals or vehicles interact with scheduled roadworks can help in optimizing routes and minimizing delays. It can also be applied in game development where characters move through a world with dynamic obstacles, or in robotics for pathfinding algorithms where certain paths may be blocked at specific times."
