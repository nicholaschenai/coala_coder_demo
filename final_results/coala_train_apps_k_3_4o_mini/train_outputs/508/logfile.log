## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
There is an infinitely long street that runs west to east, which we consider as a number line.
There are N roadworks scheduled on this street.
The i-th roadwork blocks the point at coordinate X_i from time S_i - 0.5 to time T_i - 0.5.
Q people are standing at coordinate 0. The i-th person will start the coordinate 0 at time D_i, continue to walk with speed 1 in the positive direction and stop walking when reaching a blocked point.
Find the distance each of the Q people will walk.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 0 \leq S_i < T_i \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq X_i \leq 10^9
 - 0 \leq D_1 < D_2 < ... < D_Q \leq 10^9
 - If i \neq j and X_i = X_j, the intervals [S_i, T_i) and [S_j, T_j) do not overlap.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N Q
S_1 T_1 X_1
:
S_N T_N X_N
D_1
:
D_Q

-----Output-----
Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the distance the i-th person will walk or -1 if that person walks forever.

The first person starts coordinate 0 at time 0 and stops walking at coordinate 2 when reaching a point blocked by the first roadwork at time 2.
The second person starts coordinate 0 at time 1 and reaches coordinate 2 at time 3. The first roadwork has ended, but the fourth roadwork has begun, so this person also stops walking at coordinate 2.
The fourth and sixth persons encounter no roadworks while walking, so they walk forever. The output for these cases is -1.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a street represented as a number line where certain points are blocked by roadworks at specific times. Each person starts walking from the origin (coordinate 0) at a given time and moves towards the positive direction at a speed of 1 unit per time unit. We need to determine how far each person can walk before they encounter a blocked point. If they can walk indefinitely without encountering a block, we return -1 for that person.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will first read the number of roadworks and people.
   - For each roadwork, we will store the blocking information (start time, end time, and position) in a list.
   - For each person, we will check their start time and calculate the time they reach each blocking point.
   - If the person reaches a blocking point during its active time, we will record the distance they can walk. If they reach a point after it has ended or if there are no blocks in their path, we will determine if they can walk indefinitely.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Read N and Q
   Initialize an empty list for roadworks
   For i from 1 to N:
       Read S_i, T_i, X_i
       Append (S_i, T_i, X_i) to roadworks

   Sort roadworks by X_i

   For each person:
       Read D_i
       Initialize distance as -1
       For each roadwork in roadworks:
           If D_i < S_i:
               Calculate the distance they can walk (which is X_i)
               If distance is not updated, set distance to X_i
           Else if S_i <= D_i < T_i:
               Calculate the distance they can walk (which is X_i)
               Set distance to X_i
           Else if D_i >= T_i:
               Continue to next roadwork
       If distance is still -1, set it to -1 (indicating they walk forever)
       Print distance
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main challenge was to efficiently handle two types of operations on a list of hill heights: determining the final position after a series of jumps and updating the heights of a specified range. The core concept involved simulating the jumps based on the heights of the hills and ensuring that the jumps adhered to the constraints provided (i.e., jumping only to the nearest taller hill and not exceeding a distance of 100).

    The solution involved iterating through the hills for each jump operation, which worked well within the constraints. The height update operation was straightforward, directly modifying the heights in the specified range. The implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic for both operations was clearly defined.

    One key takeaway was the importance of efficiently checking conditions during the jump operation to avoid unnecessary iterations, especially given the potential size of the input (up to 100,000 hills and operations). The final implementation was effective, and the tests passed without any issues, indicating that the approach was sound. 

    The code snippet for the solution is as follows:

    ```python
    def find_final_hill(N, heights, operations):
        for operation in operations:
            if operation[0] == 1:  # Type 1 operation
                i = operation[1]
                k = operation[2]
                current_hill = i
                for jump in range(k):
                    next_hill = current_hill + 1
                    while next_hill <= N and (heights[next_hill - 1] <= heights[current_hill - 1] or next_hill - current_hill > 100):
                        next_hill += 1
                    if next_hill > N:
                        break
                    current_hill = next_hill
                print(current_hill)
            elif operation[0] == 2:  # Type 2 operation
                L = operation[1]
                R = operation[2]
                X = operation[3]
                for j in range(L - 1, R):
                    heights[j] += X

    # Read input
    N, Q = map(int, input().split())
    heights = list(map(int, input().split()))
    operations = []
    for _ in range(Q):
        operations.append(list(map(int, input().split())))

[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine the number of valid paths Ryan can take through a network of cities connected by roads, given specific conditions about where he must be at certain times. The approach involved using dynamic programming to track the number of ways to reach each city at each second.

    ### Key Concepts:
    1. **Dynamic Programming**: The solution required maintaining a 2D DP table where `dp[time][city]` represents the number of ways to be in `city` at `time`. The base case was initialized with `dp[0][1] = 1`, indicating Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0.

    2. **Adjacency List**: An adjacency list was created to represent the roads between cities, allowing for efficient traversal of connected cities.

    3. **Path Counting**: The DP table was updated to account for both staying in the same city and moving to adjacent cities. This was a crucial step that needed careful implementation to ensure all paths were counted correctly.

    ### Issues Encountered:
    - The initial implementations failed to correctly propagate the number of ways to reach each city, particularly in how the DP table was updated. The logic for moving to neighbors was not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect results.
    - The conditions checking at the end of the computation were also not yielding the expected results due to the incorrect state of the DP table.

    ### Lessons Learned:
    - It is essential to ensure that all possible transitions (staying and moving) are accurately reflected in the DP updates.
    - Testing edge cases and ensuring that the DP table is filled correctly is crucial for the final output to be accurate.
    - The importance of modular arithmetic in preventing overflow issues when dealing with large numbers in combinatorial problems.

    ### Final Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def count_paths(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]
        dp[0][1] = 1  # Start at city 1 at time 0

        adj = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
        for u, v in roads:
            adj[u].append(v)
            adj[v].append(u)

        for time in range(1, K + 1):
            for city in range(1, N + 1):
                dp[time][city] = dp[time - 1][city]  # Stay in the same city
                for neighbor in adj[city]:
                    dp[time][city] = (dp[time][city] + dp[time - 1][neighbor]) % MOD  # Move to neighbor

        valid_paths = 1
        for a_i, b_i in conditions:
            valid_paths = (valid_paths * dp[b_i][a_i]) % MOD

        return valid_paths
    ```

    This summary encapsulates the core concepts, strategies, and lessons learned from the problem-solving process, which can be useful for future reference in similar dynamic programming challenges.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
        Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

        -----Input-----
        - First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
        - The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
        - The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
        - The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
        - The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

        -----Output-----
        For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
        - $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
        - $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
        - $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
        - $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
        - Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

        1
        2
        1 3
        5
        0 0
        2 0
        0 4
        1 1
        1 2

        -----Sample Output-----
        0
        1
        2
        1
        -1

        -----Explanation-----
        The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

        If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

        If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

        If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

Each wall is represented by a line segment connecting points (a_i, 0) and (0, a_i). For each query, we need to check Chef's starting position (x_j, y_j) and determine how many walls he must break to reach the origin. If Chef starts on a wall, we return -1.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           - For each test case, read the number of walls and their respective positions.
           - For each query, check if the starting position lies on any wall. If it does, return -1.
           - If not, determine how many walls Chef needs to break through. A wall is considered broken if Chef's starting position is above and to the right of the wall's line segment.
           - The walls can be represented as a list of integers, and for each query, we can count how many of these integers are greater than the maximum of the x and y coordinates of Chef's starting position.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function count_walls(N, walls, queries):
               for each query (x_j, y_j):
                   if (x_j, y_j) lies on any wall:
                       print -1
                   else:
                       count = 0
                       for each wall a_i in walls:
                           if a_i > max(x_j, y_j):
                               count += 1
                       print count

           function main(T):
               for each test case:
                   read N
                   read walls
                   read Q
                   read queries
                   count_walls(N, walls, queries)
           ```

INFO - [Task id] 508 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We have an infinitely long street represented as a number line, where there are several roadworks that block specific points for certain time intervals. People start walking from the origin (coordinate 0) at different times and will stop walking when they reach a blocked point. Our task is to determine how far each person can walk before they are stopped by a roadwork or if they can walk indefinitely.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - First, we need to read the number of roadworks and their respective blocking intervals and positions.
   - For each person, we will check their starting time and calculate the time they reach each blocked point.
   - If a person reaches a blocked point during its blocking time, we record that distance. If they reach a point after the blocking has ended, they can continue walking.
   - If they never encounter a blocked point, they can walk indefinitely, and we will return -1 for that person.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function calculate_distances(N, roadworks, Q, people):
       sort roadworks by position
       for each person in people:

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
There is an infinitely long street that runs west to east, which we consider as a number line.
There are N roadworks scheduled on this street.
The i-th roadwork blocks the point at coordinate X_i from time S_i - 0.5 to time T_i - 0.5.
Q people are standing at coordinate 0. The i-th person will start the coordinate 0 at time D_i, continue to walk with speed 1 in the positive direction and stop walking when reaching a blocked point.
Find the distance each of the Q people will walk.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 0 \leq S_i < T_i \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq X_i \leq 10^9
 - 0 \leq D_1 < D_2 < ... < D_Q \leq 10^9
 - If i \neq j and X_i = X_j, the intervals [S_i, T_i) and [S_j, T_j) do not overlap.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N Q
S_1 T_1 X_1
:
S_N T_N X_N
D_1
:
D_Q

-----Output-----
Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the distance the i-th person will walk or -1 if that person walks forever.

-----Sample Input-----

The first person starts coordinate 0 at time 0 and stops walking at coordinate 2 when reaching a point blocked by the first roadwork at time 2.
The second person starts coordinate 0 at time 1 and reaches coordinate 2 at time 3. The first roadwork has ended, but the fourth roadwork has begun, so this person also stops walking at coordinate 2.
The fourth and sixth persons encounter no roadworks while walking, so they walk forever. The output for these cases is -1.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions
Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [generation text] In this task, I was required to determine how far each person can walk on a number line before encountering roadworks that block specific points for certain time intervals. The problem involved sorting and iterating through roadworks while checking each person's starting time and position.

The core concept tested here was the ability to manage time intervals and coordinate positions effectively. The solution involved sorting the roadworks by their position and then checking for each person if they would reach a blocked point during its blocking time. If they did, I recorded the distance; if not, they could walk indefinitely.

The implemented solution worked correctly, as it passed all provided test cases. The key strategies that worked included sorting the roadworks and using a straightforward loop to check each person's path against the blocking intervals. There were no unexpected errors, and the logic was straightforward, leading to a clean and efficient solution. 

The final code snippet effectively encapsulated the logic needed to solve the problem:

```python
def calculate_distances(N, roadworks, Q, people):
    roadworks.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])  # Sort by X_i
    results = []
    for D in people:
        distance = -1  # Default to -1 (walks indefinitely)
        for S, T, X in roadworks:
            time_to_reach = D + X
            if S <= time_to_reach < T:
                distance = X  # They stop at this blocked point
                break
        results.append(distance)

    for result in results:
        print(result)

def main():
    N, Q = map(int, input().split())
    roadworks = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]
    people = [int(input()) for _ in range(Q)]
    calculate_distances(N, roadworks, Q, people)

main()
``` 

This experience reinforced the importance of understanding time complexity and efficient data handling when dealing with large inputs, as the constraints were significant.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
There is an infinitely long street that runs west to east, which we consider as a number line.
There are N roadworks scheduled on this street.
The i-th roadwork blocks the point at coordinate X_i from time S_i - 0.5 to time T_i - 0.5.
Q people are standing at coordinate 0. The i-th person will start the coordinate 0 at time D_i, continue to walk with speed 1 in the positive direction and stop walking when reaching a blocked point.
Find the distance each of the Q people will walk.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 0 \leq S_i < T_i \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq X_i \leq 10^9
 - 0 \leq D_1 < D_2 < ... < D_Q \leq 10^9
 - If i \neq j and X_i = X_j, the intervals [S_i, T_i) and [S_j, T_j) do not overlap.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N Q
S_1 T_1 X_1
:
S_N T_N X_N
D_1
:
D_Q

-----Output-----
Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the distance the i-th person will walk or -1 if that person walks forever.

-----Sample Input-----

1 3 2
7 13 10
18 20 13
3 4 2

-----Sample Output-----

-1

The first person starts coordinate 0 at time 0 and stops walking at coordinate 2 when reaching a point blocked by the first roadwork at time 2.
The second person starts coordinate 0 at time 1 and reaches coordinate 2 at time 3. The first roadwork has ended, but the fourth roadwork has begun, so this person also stops walking at coordinate 2.
The fourth and sixth persons encounter no roadworks while walking, so they walk forever. The output for these cases is -1.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We have an infinitely long street represented as a number line, where there are several roadworks that block specific points for certain time intervals. People start walking from the origin (coordinate 0) at different times and will stop walking when they reach a blocked point. Our task is to determine how far each person can walk before they are stopped by a roadwork or if they can walk indefinitely.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - First, we need to read the number of roadworks and their respective blocking intervals and positions.
   - For each person, we will check their starting time and calculate the time they reach each blocked point.
   - If a person reaches a blocked point during its blocking time, we record that distance. If they reach a point after the blocking has ended, they can continue walking.
   - If they never encounter a blocked point, they can walk indefinitely, and we will return -1 for that person.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function calculate_distances(N, roadworks, Q, people):
       sort roadworks by position
       for each person in people:
           initialize distance = -1
           for each roadwork in roadworks:
               if person starts walking at time D_i:
                   time_to_reach = D_i + position of roadwork
                   if time_to_reach is within the blocking time:
                       distance = position of roadwork
                       break
           if distance is still -1:
               return -1
           else:
               return distance

   function main():
       read N and Q
       read roadworks
       read people
       calculate_distances(N, roadworks, Q, people)
   ```

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [generation text] The official solution employs a more efficient approach using event processing and a priority queue (min-heap) to handle the roadworks and people's movements. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Event Creation**: The solution creates a list of events for both the roadworks and the people. Each roadwork generates two events: one for when it starts blocking a point and another for when it stops blocking. The events are represented as tuples containing the time, type of event (start, stop, or person), and the position.

2. **Sorting Events**: All events are sorted by time. This allows the algorithm to process events in chronological order, ensuring that the state of the roadworks is accurately reflected when a person starts walking.

3. **Using a Priority Queue**: A priority queue is used to keep track of currently blocked positions. When a person starts walking, the algorithm checks the priority queue to find the nearest blocked point that is still active. If the point is blocked, the person stops there; if not, they can walk indefinitely.

4. **Handling State**: A dictionary (`isClosed`) is used to track whether a position is currently blocked or not. This allows for efficient updates and checks as events are processed.

5. **Output**: Finally, the results for each person are collected and printed in the order they were queried.

### Key Takeaways:
- The use of event-driven simulation allows for efficient handling of overlapping intervals and queries.
- Sorting events and processing them in order is crucial for maintaining the correct state of the system.
- Utilizing a priority queue helps efficiently manage the active roadworks, allowing for quick access to the nearest blocked point.

This approach is more optimal than the initial solution, especially given the constraints, as it reduces the complexity of checking each person's path against all roadworks. The official solution effectively handles up to 200,000 roadworks and queries in a manageable time frame.

The main function is `main`.
INFO - [Task id] 508 [generation text] This function reads input values for the number of roadworks and people, then collects the details of the roadworks and the distances each person intends to travel. It subsequently calls another function to calculate the distances that each person can travel before encountering a roadwork blockage. The results are then printed for each individual, indicating either the distance they can travel before being stopped or a default value if they can walk indefinitely. The function effectively manages input and output while delegating the distance calculation to another part of the program.
