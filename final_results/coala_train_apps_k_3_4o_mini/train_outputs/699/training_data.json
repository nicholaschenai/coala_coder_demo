    "summary": "In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the problems created by his setters, the number of problems needed for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.\n\nThe solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the available days to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging simple loops and arithmetic.\n\nThe final implementation was clean and efficient, successfully passing all provided test cases. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all edge cases (like having fewer problems than needed for a single contest) are considered. The solution was implemented without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints given. \n\nHere\u2019s the final code snippet for future reference:\n\n```python\ndef max_contests(T):\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        total_problems = sum(A)\n        contests_possible = total_problems // K\n        max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n        print(max_contests)\n\nT = int(input())\nmax_contests(T)\n``` \n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of clear problem understanding and systematic solution development.",
    "reflection": "The official solution effectively simplifies the problem by directly calculating the total number of problems and determining how many contests can be formed in a straightforward manner. The key steps are:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it captures the number of setters (N), the number of problems required for a contest (K), and the number of days available (D).\n2. **Problem Summation**: It computes the total number of problems created by summing the list of problems from each setter.\n3. **Contest Calculation**: It calculates the maximum number of contests that can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required for each contest.\n4. **Final Output**: It prints the minimum of the contests possible and the days available, ensuring that the output respects the constraints of the problem.\n\nThe official solution is concise and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for input and summation, which keeps the code clean and readable. \n\nOne insight from this experience is the importance of directly addressing the problem constraints in a clear manner. The official solution does this effectively by using a single line to compute the number of contests and another to print the result, which is both efficient and easy to understand. \n\nOverall, the approach I took was similar, but the official solution's brevity and clarity highlight the effectiveness of straightforward calculations in competitive programming.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: max_contests]\nThe function processes multiple test cases to determine the maximum number of contests that can be hosted based on the number of problems created by setters, the number of problems required for each contest, and the available days. For each test case, it reads the number of setters, required problems, and available days, then calculates the total number of problems created. It computes how many contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by the required problems per contest. Finally, it determines the maximum contests that can be hosted by taking the minimum of the contests possible and the available days, and prints the result for each test case.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where event planning is required, particularly in competitive programming or hackathon settings where a certain number of problems must be prepared for contests. It can also apply to project management situations where resources (in this case, problems) are limited and need to be allocated efficiently over a set period. Understanding how to maximize the use of available resources while adhering to constraints is a valuable skill in various fields, including education, software development, and event organization."
