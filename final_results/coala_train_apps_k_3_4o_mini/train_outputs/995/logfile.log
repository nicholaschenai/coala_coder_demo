## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mr. Krabs loves money. He enters a bank and sees that there are n rooms arranged in a row. The only rooms with doors are the two rooms on either corner. Initially, all the rooms are locked (including the corner ones). To enter a room, it must be unlocked with a key.
Mr. Krabs is able to steal k keys from the sleeping night guard. Each key can be used to unlock only one room. To reach one of the inner rooms, he has to unlock an adjacent room first.
Eg: If there are 5 rooms labelled: 1 2 3 4 5
Only Rooms 1 and 5 can be accessed initially. To unlock room 2, either room 1 or room 3 must be unlocked. Similarly to unlock Room 4, he must unlock room 5 or room 3 first.
Each room has some money in it. The money present in room i is given by A[i]. Using the k keys, calculate what is the maximum possible amount of money obtainable.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain n,  number of rooms.
- Second line will contain space separated integers, denoting A[i], money present in each room.
- Third line will contain an integer, k, the number of keys available.

-----Output:-----
Maximum money obtained.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 10^5
- 1 <= A[i] <= 10^4
- 1 <= k <= Number of Rooms

-----Subtasks-----
- 40 points : 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 100
- 60 points : Number of Rooms > 100

-----Sample Input:-----
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 1
3

-----Sample Output:-----
12

-----Explanation:-----
For the first step, Mr. Krabs can only unlock the room at the left corner or the right corner. If he unlocks the room in the right corner, he obtains 1 dollar. He can then go on to unlock the second last room and gain 6 dollars, for a total of 7 dollars. Finally he can unlock the third last room and get 5 dollars, for a total of 12 dollars. 
This is the maximum amount of money he can get with only 3 keys.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English

INFO - [Task id] 995 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Mr. Krabs is in a bank with a row of rooms, each containing some money. He can only unlock the first or last room initially, and he has a limited number of keys to unlock additional rooms. The goal is to determine the maximum amount of money he can collect by strategically using the keys to unlock the rooms.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will consider the maximum money that can be collected by unlocking rooms from either end of the row. We will keep track of the total money collected as we unlock rooms, ensuring that we do not exceed the number of keys available. We will explore both directions (from the left and from the right) and calculate the maximum money obtainable by unlocking rooms in a way that maximizes the total amount collected.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_money(n, A, k):
       left_money = 0
       right_money = 0
       
       // Calculate money from the left side
       for i from 0 to min(k, n) - 1:
           left_money += A[i]
       
       // Calculate money from the right side
       for i from 0 to min(k, n) - 1:
           right_money += A[n - 1 - i]
       
       // Find the maximum money obtainable
       max_money = max(left_money, right_money)
       
       // Check combinations of keys used from both sides
       for i from 1 to k - 1:
           if i < n and (k - i) < n:
               current_money = sum of A[0 to i-1] + sum of A[n - 1 to n - (k - i)]
               max_money = max(max_money, current_money)
       
       return max_money
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def max_money(n, A, k):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of money collected from both ends
    left_money = 0
    right_money = 0
    
    # Calculate total money that can be collected from the left side
    for i in range(min(k, n)):
        left_money += A[i]
    
    # Calculate total money that can be collected from the right side
    for i in range(min(k, n)):
        right_money += A[n - 1 - i]
    
    # Start with the maximum money obtainable from either side
    max_money = max(left_money, right_money)
    
    # Check combinations of keys used from both sides
    for i in range(1, k):
        if i < n and (k - i) < n:
            current_money = sum(A[0:i]) + sum(A[n - (k - i):n])

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy given a list of prices and a budget. The core concept involved sorting the prices to prioritize purchasing the cheapest chocolates first, which is a common greedy algorithm strategy.

    The solution was straightforward: after sorting the prices, I iterated through the list, maintaining a running total of the amount spent and counting the chocolates bought until the budget was exceeded. This approach effectively maximized the number of chocolates purchased.

    The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test case without any issues. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of sorting in optimization problems where resource allocation is constrained, as it allows for a more efficient selection process. The code snippet used is as follows:

    ```python
    def max_chocolates(n, k, prices):
        prices.sort()
        total_spent = 0
        chocolates_bought = 0
    
        for price in prices:
            if total_spent + price <= k:
                total_spent += price
                chocolates_bought += 1
            else:
                break
    
        return chocolates_bought

    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(max_chocolates(n, k, prices))
    ``` 

    This solution effectively addresses the problem and can be referenced for similar future tasks involving budget constraints and optimization.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
           Anushka wants to buy as many chocolates as possible with a limited amount of money. Each chocolate has a specific price, and she needs to figure out how many chocolates she can buy without exceeding her budget.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
           To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
           - First, we will sort the list of chocolate prices in ascending order. This way, we can start buying the cheapest chocolates first, which will allow Anushka to maximize the number of chocolates she can buy.
           - Then, we will iterate through the sorted list of prices, keeping track of the total amount spent and the number of chocolates bought. We will stop when adding another chocolate would exceed her budget.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function max_chocolates(n, k, prices):
               sort prices in ascending order
               total_spent = 0
               chocolates_bought = 0
       
               for price in prices:
                   if total_spent + price <= k:
                       total_spent += price
                       chocolates_bought += 1
                   else:

               return chocolates_bought

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money (K) to N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money, such that he ends up with exactly zero. The key insights were that if the total demand from all minions exceeds K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and if the total demand equals K, he can distribute the money exactly.

    Initially, I implemented a solution that simply checked if the total demand was greater than, equal to, or less than K. However, this approach failed to account for the scenario where the total demand was less than K but could still be distributed in a way that Gru ends up with zero. The logic needed to ensure that Gru could fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.

    The correct approach involves:
    1. Calculating the total demand.
    2. Checking if the total demand exceeds K (output "NO").
    3. If the total demand equals K, output "YES".
    4. If the total demand is less than K, output "NO" since Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.

    The final code snippet that captures this logic is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, input().split())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
            total_demand = sum(A)
        
            if total_demand > K:
                print("NO")
            elif total_demand == K:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    can_distribute_money(T)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the conditions under which money can be distributed and ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly.

INFO - [Task id] 995 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   Mr. Krabs wants to maximize the amount of money he can collect from a series of rooms arranged in a row. He can only unlock the two corner rooms initially and has a limited number of keys to unlock additional rooms. Each room contains a certain amount of money, and he needs to strategically use his keys to unlock the rooms that will yield the highest total amount of money.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Start by recognizing that Mr. Krabs can only unlock the first or last room initially.
   - Use a greedy approach to maximize the money collected by considering the best combination of rooms he can unlock with the available keys.
   - We can simulate unlocking rooms from both ends (left and right) and keep track of the maximum money collected for each possible combination of keys used.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function max_money(n, A, k):
       max_money_collected = 0
       
       # Try unlocking from the left side
       for i from 0 to min(k, n) (inclusive):
           money_collected = sum of A[0 to i-1] + sum of A[n-i to n-1]

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mr. Krabs loves money. He enters a bank and sees that there are n rooms arranged in a row. The only rooms with doors are the two rooms on either corner. Initially, all the rooms are locked (including the corner ones). To enter a room, it must be unlocked with a key.
Mr. Krabs is able to steal k keys from the sleeping night guard. Each key can be used to unlock only one room. To reach one of the inner rooms, he has to unlock an adjacent room first.
Eg: If there are 5 rooms labelled: 1 2 3 4 5
Only Rooms 1 and 5 can be accessed initially. To unlock room 2, either room 1 or room 3 must be unlocked. Similarly to unlock Room 4, he must unlock room 5 or room 3 first.
Each room has some money in it. The money present in room i is given by A[i]. Using the k keys, calculate what is the maximum possible amount of money obtainable.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain n,  number of rooms.
- Second line will contain space separated integers, denoting A[i], money present in each room.
- Third line will contain an integer, k, the number of keys available.

-----Output:-----
Maximum money obtained.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 10^5
- 1 <= A[i] <= 10^4
- 1 <= k <= Number of Rooms

-----Subtasks-----
- 40 points : 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 100
- 60 points : Number of Rooms > 100

-----Sample Input:-----
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 1
3

-----Sample Output:-----
12

-----Explanation:-----
For the first step, Mr. Krabs can only unlock the room at the left corner or the right corner. If he unlocks the room in the right corner, he obtains 1 dollar. He can then go on to unlock the second last room and gain 6 dollars, for a total of 7 dollars. Finally he can unlock the third last room and get 5 dollars, for a total of 12 dollars. 
This is the maximum amount of money he can get with only 3 keys.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 995 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to maximize the amount of money Mr. Krabs could collect from a series of rooms using a limited number of keys. The key concepts involved understanding the constraints of unlocking rooms only from the corners and using a greedy approach to evaluate the best combinations of rooms to unlock.

The solution involved iterating through possible numbers of rooms to unlock from the left and calculating the corresponding money collected from both ends. The approach was straightforward and effectively utilized the properties of summation to determine the maximum money obtainable.

The final implementation successfully passed the provided test case, demonstrating that the logic was sound. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of considering edge cases and constraints when designing algorithms, especially in problems involving combinations and greedy strategies. The solution was efficient and adhered to the problem's requirements without the need for external libraries. 

Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

```python
def max_money(n, A, k):
    max_money_collected = 0
    for i in range(min(k, n) + 1):
        money_collected = sum(A[:i]) + sum(A[n - (k - i):])
        max_money_collected = max(max_money_collected, money_collected)
    return max_money_collected

n = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))
k = int(input())
print(max_money(n, A, k))
``` 

This solution effectively captures the essence of the problem and provides a clear method for calculating the maximum money Mr. Krabs can collect.

INFO - [Task id] 995 [generation text] The official solution takes a different approach to solving the problem, focusing on iterating through the number of keys and calculating the total money collected for each possible combination of rooms unlocked from both ends. 

Key insights from the official solution:

1. **Iterative Calculation**: The solution uses a loop that iterates over the number of keys. For each iteration, it calculates the total money collected by summing the money from the rightmost rooms and the leftmost rooms based on the current key count.

2. **Dynamic Indexing**: The use of negative indexing (`b` starts at -1 and decrements) allows the solution to dynamically adjust which rooms are being considered from the right side, while the left side is handled by a straightforward slice.

3. **Storage of Totals**: The solution stores the total money collected for each configuration in a list (`tot`) and finally retrieves the maximum value from this list.

4. **Efficiency**: The official solution efficiently calculates the total money without needing to compute sums repeatedly for the same room configurations, which can be a potential inefficiency in other approaches.

In contrast, my initial approach involved calculating the sums for both sides in a nested manner, which could lead to redundant calculations and potentially higher time complexity. The official solution's method of iterating through the keys and adjusting the indices dynamically is more efficient and straightforward.

Overall, the official solution effectively balances clarity and efficiency, making it a better approach for this problem. In future implementations, I should consider using similar iterative and dynamic indexing techniques to optimize performance.

    1 2 3 4 5 6 1
    3

    -----Sample Output:-----
    12

    -----Explanation:-----
    For the first step, Mr. Krabs can only unlock the room at the left corner or the right corner. If he unlocks the room in the right corner, he obtains 1 dollar. He can then go on to unlock the second last room and gain 6 dollars, for a total of 7 dollars. Finally he can unlock the third last room and get 5 dollars, for a total of 12 dollars. 
    This is the maximum amount of money he can get with only 3 keys.
[/Problem]

[Solution]

    def max_money(n, A, k):
        # Initialize the maximum money collected
        max_money_collected = 0
    
        # Try unlocking from the left side
        for i in range(min(k, n) + 1):
            # Calculate money collected by unlocking i rooms from the left
            money_collected = sum(A[:i]) + sum(A[n - (k - i):])  # Rooms from the left and right
            max_money_collected = max(max_money_collected, money_collected)  # Update max money
    
        return max_money_collected  # Return the maximum money collected

    # Read input values
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k = int(input())

    # Print the result of the max_money function
    print(max_money(n, A, k))
