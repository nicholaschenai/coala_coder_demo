    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   We need to determine if we can modify a sequence of integers such that the sum of all its elements becomes zero. The modification allowed is to decrease any element at index `i` by `i` any number of times.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we can calculate the total sum of the sequence. If the sum is already zero, we can immediately return \"YES\". If the sum is positive, we need to check if we can reduce it to zero by using the allowed operations. Each element can be decreased by its index, which means we can reduce the total sum by a maximum of `i` for each element at index `i`. We can calculate the maximum possible reduction and see if it is sufficient to bring the total sum to zero.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function can_make_good_sequence(T):\n       for each test case:\n           read N\n           read array A\n           total_sum = sum(A)\n           max_reduction = sum of indices from 1 to N (which is N * (N + 1) / 2)\n           \n           if total_sum <= max_reduction:\n               print \"YES\"\n           else:\n               print \"NO\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef can_make_good_sequence(T):\n    # Iterate through each test case\n    for _ in range(T):\n        # Read the number of elements in the sequence\n        N = int(input())\n        # Read the sequence of integers\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n        # Calculate the total sum of the sequence\n        total_sum = sum(A)\n        \n        # Calculate the maximum possible reduction\n        max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2\n        \n        # Check if we can make the sequence good\n        if total_sum <= max_reduction:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\n# Call the function to process the test cases\ncan_make_good_sequence(T)\n```",
