    "raw_msg": "Based on the detailed analysis and the insights from previous attempts, it is clear that the expected output format was misunderstood. The correct output for each test case should consist of lines that follow a specific pattern based on the integer \\( K \\). \n\n### Key Points to Address:\n1. For each test case with input \\( K \\):\n   - We need to print \\( K \\) lines.\n   - Each line \\( i \\) should consist of numbers starting from 0 up to \\( i \\) and then back down to 0.\n   - The output for each test case should be printed consecutively without any extra blank lines in between.\n\n### Corrected Logic:\n- For each line \\( i \\):\n  - Print numbers from 0 to \\( i \\).\n  - Then print numbers from \\( i-1 \\) down to 0.\n\n### Final Python Code:\nHere is the corrected code that implements the above logic:\n\n```python\ndef print_pattern(T):\n    # Loop through each test case\n    for t in range(T):\n        K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case\n        # Loop to generate each line of the pattern\n        for i in range(K):\n            line = []  # Initialize an empty list to hold the current line's numbers\n            # Append numbers from 0 to i\n            for j in range(i + 1):\n                line.append(str(j))\n            # Append numbers from i-1 down to 0\n            for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):\n                line.append(str(j))\n            # Print the current line as a string\n            print(''.join(line))\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nprint_pattern(T)  # Call the function to print the patterns for all test cases\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- The function `print_pattern` takes the number of test cases \\( T \\).\n- For each test case, it reads the integer \\( K \\).\n- It generates \\( K \\) lines where each line is constructed by first appending numbers from 0 to \\( i \\) and then appending numbers from \\( i-1 \\) down to 0.\n- Each line is printed immediately after it is constructed.\n\nThis code should now correctly generate the desired output format for each test case as specified in the problem statement.",
