    "raw_msg": "Based on the analysis and insights from previous attempts, I will correct the code to ensure it generates the desired pattern according to the specifications. The key points to address are:\n\n1. Each test case should print \\( K \\) lines.\n2. Each line \\( i \\) should consist of numbers starting from 0 up to \\( i \\) and then back down to 0.\n3. The output for each test case should be printed consecutively without any extra blank lines in between.\n\nHere is the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef print_pattern(T):\n    # Loop through each test case\n    for t in range(T):\n        K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case\n        # Loop to generate each line of the pattern\n        for i in range(K):\n            line = []  # Initialize an empty list to hold the current line's numbers\n            # Append numbers from 0 to i\n            for j in range(i + 1):\n                line.append(str(j))\n            # Append numbers from i-1 down to 0\n            for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):\n                line.append(str(j))\n            # Print the current line as a string\n            print(''.join(line))\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nprint_pattern(T)  # Call the function to print the patterns for all test cases\n```\n\n### Key Changes Made:\n- The logic for generating the pattern remains intact.\n- The output is printed directly without any additional formatting or blank lines between test cases.\n\nThis code should now correctly generate the desired output format for each test case as specified in the problem statement.",
