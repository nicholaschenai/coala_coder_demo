    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to find the minimum number of operations required to reduce a non-negative integer `n` to `0`. The operations allowed are: changing the rightmost bit of `n` (which is equivalent to subtracting `1` if the rightmost bit is `1`), and changing the `i-th` bit if the `(i-1)-th` bit is `1` and all lower bits are `0`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. The key is to understand how the binary representation of `n` can be manipulated using the allowed operations. We will keep track of the number of operations needed to reach `0`. For each operation, we will either change the rightmost bit or manipulate higher bits based on the conditions provided. The goal is to minimize the number of operations.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function minimumOneBitOperations(n):\n       if n == 0:\n           return 0  // No operations needed\n       // Count the number of operations needed to reduce n to 0\n       operations = 0\n       while n > 0:\n           // If the rightmost bit is 1, we can change it\n           if n & 1 == 1:\n               operations += 1\n           // If the second rightmost bit is 1, we can change the first bit\n           if (n & 2) == 2:\n               operations += 1\n               n -= 2  // Change the second bit\n           else:\n               n -= 1  // Change the rightmost bit\n           n >>= 1  // Shift right to process the next bit\n       return operations\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:\n        # Base case: if n is 0, no operations are needed\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        \n        operations = 0  # Initialize the operation count\n        \n        # Loop until n becomes 0\n        while n > 0:\n            # If the rightmost bit is 1, we can change it\n            if n & 1 == 1:\n                operations += 1\n            \n            # If the second rightmost bit is 1, we can change the first bit\n            if (n & 2) == 2:\n                operations += 1\n                n -= 2  # Change the second bit\n            else:\n                n -= 1  # Change the rightmost bit\n            \n            n >>= 1  # Shift right to process the next bit\n        \n        return operations  # Return the total number of operations\n```",
