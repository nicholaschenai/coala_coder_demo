    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The problem requires us to find the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that can cover a set of points in a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides aligned with a line that has a slope defined by a given number \\( M \\).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   - We need to determine the coordinates of the rectangle that will cover all the given points while maintaining the specified slope.\n   - To do this, we can rotate the coordinate system such that the rectangle's sides align with the axes. This involves transforming the points based on the slope \\( M \\).\n   - After transforming the points, we can find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the transformed points to determine the dimensions of the rectangle.\n   - Finally, we can calculate the perimeter of the rectangle using the formula \\( P = 2 \\times (width + height) \\).\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function calculate_perimeter(N, M, points):\n       transformed_points = []\n       for each point (x, y) in points:\n           new_x = x + M * y\n           new_y = M * x - y\n           transformed_points.append((new_x, new_y))\n       \n       min_x = min(transformed_points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]\n       max_x = max(transformed_points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]\n       min_y = min(transformed_points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]\n       max_y = max(transformed_points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]\n       \n       width = max_x - min_x\n       height = max_y - min_y\n       perimeter = 2 * (width + height)\n       return perimeter\n\n   function main():\n       read N, M\n       points = []\n       for i from 1 to N:\n           read x, y\n           points.append((x, y))\n       perimeter = calculate_perimeter(N, M, points)\n       print(perimeter)\n\n   main()\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef calculate_perimeter(N, M, points):\n    transformed_points = []\n    # Transform each point based on the slope M\n    for x, y in points:\n        new_x = x + M * y  # New x coordinate after transformation\n        new_y = M * x - y  # New y coordinate after transformation\n        transformed_points.append((new_x, new_y))\n    \n    # Find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates\n    min_x = min(transformed_points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]\n    max_x = max(transformed_points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]\n    min_y = min(transformed_points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]\n    max_y = max(transformed_points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]\n    \n    # Calculate width and height of the rectangle\n    width = max_x - min_x\n    height = max_y - min_y\n    # Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle\n    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)\n    return perimeter\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the number of points N and the slope M\n    N, M = map(int, input().split())\n    points = []\n    # Read each point's coordinates\n    for _ in range(N):\n        x, y = map(int, input().split())\n        points.append((x, y))\n    # Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle\n    perimeter = calculate_perimeter(N, M, points)\n    # Print the perimeter with sufficient precision\n    print(f\"{perimeter:.12f}\")\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n```",
