1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 689 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a number of zebras in a jungle, each located at a specific position. Each zebra spits a certain distance either to the right or to the left. We need to determine if there are any two zebras that spit at each other, meaning that one zebra's spit lands on the position of another zebra that spits back to the first zebra's position.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to map each zebra's position to the position it spits to. We will then check if any zebra's spit lands on another zebra's position and if that zebra spits back to the first zebra's position. If such a pair exists, we will output "YES"; otherwise, we will output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store zebra positions and their spit targets.
   - For each zebra, read its position and spit distance.
   - Calculate the target position where the spit lands.
   - Store this information in the dictionary.
   - After processing all zebras, iterate through the dictionary:
     - For each zebra's position, check if the target position exists in the dictionary and if the spit from that target position returns to the original zebra's position.
   - If such a pair is found, print "YES". If no pairs are found after checking all, print "NO".

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def are_zebras_spitting_at_each_other(t, records):
    # Dictionary to store zebra positions and their spit targets
    spit_map = {}
    
    # Process each zebra's position and spit distance
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = records[i]
        target_position = a + b  # Calculate where the spit lands
        spit_map[a] = target_position  # Map zebra's position to its spit target
    
    # Check for any two zebras that spit at each other
    for position, target in spit_map.items():
        if target in spit_map:  # Check if the target position has a zebra
            if spit_map[target] == position:  # Check if it spits back to the original position
                return "YES"  # Found a pair that spits at each other
    
    return "NO"  # No pairs found

# Read input
t = int(input())
records = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(t)]

# Call the function and print the result

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by moving one character from any position in a given string to any other position. The solution required iterating through each character, removing it, and inserting it at every possible position in the remaining string to find the smallest possible arrangement.

    Throughout the attempts, the main issues revolved around correctly handling the input and output formats. Initially, the output was printed directly as strings, which did not match the expected format of a list of dictionaries. The expected output was to be structured as `[{smallest_string}]` for each test case, but the implementation was returning a list of strings instead.

    The final solution involved collecting results in a list and ensuring that the output was printed in the correct format. The key takeaway was the importance of adhering to the specified output format, as it can lead to confusion and failed tests if not followed precisely.

    Hereâs the final code snippet that was intended to solve the problem:

    ```python
    def find_lexicographically_smallest_string(test_cases):
        results = []  # To collect results for each test case
        for s in test_cases:
            smallest_string = s
            n = len(s)
        
            for i in range(n):
                char = s[i]
                new_string = s[:i] + s[i+1:]
            
                for j in range(n - 1):
                    candidate_string = new_string[:j] + char + new_string[j:]
                    if candidate_string < smallest_string:
                        smallest_string = candidate_string
        
            results.append({smallest_string})  # Collect the smallest string for the test case in a dictionary

        print(results)  # Print the results as a list of dictionaries

    # Read number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]
    find_lexicographically_smallest_string(test_cases)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly, especially regarding input and output formats, to ensure successful implementation.

        The MarkiT online virtual market startup wants to organize its grand opening in NIT Patna.
        but they want maximum crowd for their inauguration. So the manager told  this  to Praveen a student in NITP who suggested them:
        The first-year students come to campus  every x hour,
        Second-year students come to campus every y hour,
        Third-year students come to campus every z hour and 
        Fourth-year is very busy so they don't come regularly.
        So Praveen being very clever told him the no of times in n days he can have an audience of all year student (1st,2nd & 3rd) at max. So can you code what Praveen has done?

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
           The problem requires us to determine how many times first, second, and third-year students will all be present on campus together over a given number of days. Each group of students arrives at specific intervals (every x, y, and z hours respectively). We need to find the number of days within a specified range where all three groups are present simultaneously.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           - For each test case, read the number of days (N) and the intervals (x, y, z) for the three groups of students.
           - To find the days when all three groups are present, we need to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals (x, y, z). This will give us the frequency at which all three groups will be present together.
           - Count how many multiples of this LCM fit within the range of days (1 to N).

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function gcd(a, b):
               while b != 0:
                   a, b = b, a % b
               return a

           function lcm(a, b):
               return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

           function calculate_lcm(x, y, z):
               return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)

           function count_days(N, x, y, z):
               lcm_value = calculate_lcm(x, y, z)
               return N // lcm_value

           function main(T):
               for each test case:
                   read N
                   read x, y, z
                   result = count_days(N, x, y, z)

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such substring remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate strings and utilize loops for repeated operations. The solution successfully handled multiple test cases by reading input, processing each string, and outputting the final result after all removals.

    The implemented code used a while loop to check for "abc" and the `replace` method to remove it. This method was efficient for the problem's constraints, as it ensured that the string was modified in place until no "abc" substrings were left. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def remove_abc_pairs(test_cases):
        for s in test_cases:
            while "abc" in s:
                s = s.replace("abc", "", 1)
            print(s)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]
    remove_abc_pairs(test_cases)
    ```

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding string operations and iterative processes in programming.

INFO - [Task id] 689 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves determining if there are two zebras in a jungle that spit at each other. Each zebra has a position and a distance it spits. If a zebra at position `a` spits `b` meters, it can hit another zebra at position `a + b`. We need to check if there exists a pair of zebras such that one zebra spits at the other and vice versa.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - We will read the number of zebras and their respective positions and spit distances.
   - We will store the positions and the target positions (where they spit) in a dictionary.
   - For each zebra, we will check if the target position it spits to has a zebra that spits back to its original position.
   - If such a pair is found, we will output "YES". If no such pairs exist after checking all zebras, we will output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_spitting_zebras(t, records):
       create a dictionary to store positions and their target positions
       for each record in records:
           position = record[0]
           spit_distance = record[1]
           target_position = position + spit_distance
           store target_position in the dictionary with the original position as value

       for each record in records:
           position = record[0]
           spit_distance = record[1]
           target_position = position + spit_distance
           if target_position exists in the dictionary:
               if the value at target_position is equal to position:
                   return "YES"
       return "NO"

   read t
   create an empty list for records
   for i from 0 to t:
       read a and b
       append (a, b) to records
   result = find_spitting_zebras(t, records)
   print result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves determining if there are two zebras in a jungle that spit at each other. Each zebra has a position and a distance it spits. If a zebra at position `a` spits `b` meters, it can hit another zebra at position `a + b`. We need to check if there exists a pair of zebras such that one zebra spits at the other and vice versa.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - We will read the number of zebras and their respective positions and spit distances.
   - We will store the positions and the target positions (where they spit) in a dictionary.
   - For each zebra, we will check if the target position it spits to has a zebra that spits back to its original position.
   - If such a pair is found, we will output "YES". If no such pairs exist after checking all zebras, we will output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_spitting_zebras(t, records):
       create a dictionary to store positions and their target positions
       for each record in records:
           position = record[0]

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 689 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine if there are two zebras in a jungle that spit at each other based on their positions and spit distances. The solution involved using a dictionary to map target positions to their corresponding original positions, allowing for efficient lookups to check if a zebra spits back to the original position of another zebra.

The core concept tested here was the ability to track relationships between elements (zebras) based on their properties (positions and spit distances). The strategy of using a dictionary for quick access to target positions proved effective, as it allowed for a straightforward check of whether a zebra's target position had a corresponding zebra that spits back to it.

The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against the provided test case. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution was efficient given the constraints. The approach can be reused for similar problems involving bidirectional relationships or mappings. 

Hereâs the final code snippet for reference:

```python
def find_spitting_zebras(t, records):
    spit_map = {}
    for position, spit_distance in records:
        target_position = position + spit_distance
        spit_map[target_position] = position

    for position, spit_distance in records:
        target_position = position + spit_distance
        if target_position in spit_map and spit_map[target_position] == position:
            return "YES"
    return "NO"

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    records.append((a, b))

result = find_spitting_zebras(t, records)
print(result)
``` 

This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process and the effective strategies employed, which can be useful for future reference in similar coding challenges.

INFO - [Task id] 689 [generation text] The official solution effectively uses a dictionary to map each zebra's position to the position it spits to, which is a straightforward and efficient approach. The key steps in the official solution are:

1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of zebras and their respective positions and spit distances in a loop.
2. **Dictionary Mapping**: It constructs a dictionary where the key is the zebra's position and the value is the target position (current position + spit distance).
3. **Checking for Mutual Spitting**: It iterates through the dictionary keys to check if the target position of any zebra points back to its original position, indicating mutual spitting.

The official solution is concise and leverages the dictionary's average O(1) time complexity for lookups, making it efficient. 

In my initial approach, I also used a dictionary but included an extra step of storing the original position as the value. While this works, it adds unnecessary complexity. The official solution simplifies this by directly checking the conditions without needing to store the original position separately.

Overall, the official solution is more streamlined and avoids redundancy, which is a valuable insight for future problem-solving. The key takeaway is to focus on minimizing unnecessary data storage and operations, which can lead to cleaner and more efficient code.

[Problem]
    In africa jungle , there were zebra's who liked to spit.
    There owner watched them for whole day and noted in his sheet where each zebra spitted.
    Now he's in a confusion and wants to know if in the jungle there are two zebra's which spitted at each other.
    Help him solve this task.
    If the zebra is present in position a spits b metres right , he can hit only zebra in position a+b , if such a zebra exists.

    -----Input:-----
    - The first line contains integer t(1<=t<100)- amount of zebras in jungle.
    - Each of following t lines contains two integers a(i) and b(i)(-10^4<=x(i)<=10^4,1<|d(i)|<=2.10^4) - records in owner sheet.
    - a(i) is the position of i-th zebra and b(i) is distance at which the i-th camel spitted.
    Positive values of d(i) correspond to spits right, negative values correspond to spit left.No two zebras may stand in the same position.

    -----Output:-----
    If there are two zebras , which spitted at each other , output YES, otherwise , output NO.

    -----Sample Input:-----
    2
    0 1
    1 -1

    -----Sample Output:-----
    YES

            spit_map[target_position] = position  # Store the original position that spits to this target

        # Check for each zebra if it spits at another zebra that spits back
        for position, spit_distance in records:
            target_position = position + spit_distance
            # Check if the target position exists and if it spits back to the original position
            if target_position in spit_map and spit_map[target_position] == position:
                return "YES"  # Found a pair that spits at each other

        return "NO"  # No such pairs found

    # Read number of zebras
    t = int(input())
    records = []

    # Read each zebra's position and spit distance
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        records.append((a, b))

    # Get the result and print it
    result = find_spitting_zebras(t, records)
    print(result)
