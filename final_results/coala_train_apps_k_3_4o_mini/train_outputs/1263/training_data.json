    "summary": "In this task, the goal was to determine the number of ways to express a natural number \\( N \\) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power \\( K \\). The approach involved using recursion with memoization to efficiently explore the combinations of integers.\n\nThe core concept tested was the ability to recursively break down the problem by deciding whether to include or exclude each integer in the sum. The recursive function `count_ways(N, K, max_num)` was designed to handle this, checking for base cases where \\( N \\) is zero (indicating a valid combination) or negative (indicating an invalid combination).\n\nThe implementation successfully handled the sample inputs, producing the correct outputs. The key strategy that worked well was calculating the maximum integer whose \\( K \\)-th power is less than or equal to \\( N \\), which helped limit the recursion depth and avoid unnecessary calculations.\n\nOverall, the experience reinforced the importance of recursive problem-solving techniques and the utility of memoization in optimizing performance for combinatorial problems. The final code snippet effectively encapsulated the solution:\n\n```python\ndef count_ways(N, K, max_num):\n    if N == 0:\n        return 1  # Found a valid way\n    if N < 0 or max_num <= 0:\n        return 0  # No valid way\n    \n    power = max_num ** K\n    return count_ways(N - power, K, max_num - 1) + count_ways(N, K, max_num - 1)\n\ndef main():\n    T = int(input())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        max_num = int(N ** (1/K))\n        result = count_ways(N, K, max_num)\n        print(result)\n\nmain()\n``` \n\nThis summary captures the essence of the problem-solving process and the strategies employed, which could be useful for similar future challenges.",
    "reflection": "The official solution employs a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of finding the number of ways to express a number \\( N \\) as the sum of unique integers raised to the power \\( K \\). Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The solution uses an array `reach` where `reach[j]` keeps track of the number of ways to form the sum \\( j \\) using the unique integers raised to the power \\( K \\). The array is initialized with `reach[0] = 1`, indicating that there is one way to form the sum of zero (by using no numbers).\n\n2. **Iterating Over Powers**: The outer loop iterates over integers \\( i \\) starting from 1, calculating \\( i^n \\) (the \\( K \\)-th power of \\( i \\)). The loop continues until \\( i^n \\) exceeds \\( N \\).\n\n3. **Updating the DP Array**: For each power \\( i^n \\), the inner loop iterates backward through the `reach` array. This backward iteration ensures that each integer is only used once in forming the sums, maintaining the uniqueness constraint.\n\n4. **Final Result**: After processing all integers up to the maximum possible \\( i \\), the final result is found in `reach[N]`, which gives the total number of ways to express \\( N \\) as the sum of unique integers raised to the power \\( K \\).\n\n### Key Takeaways:\n- The dynamic programming approach is efficient for this problem, as it avoids the overhead of recursion and memoization.\n- The backward iteration in the DP array is crucial for ensuring that each integer is only counted once in each combination.\n- The solution effectively handles the constraints provided, making it suitable for the given problem size.\n\nThis experience highlights the importance of considering different algorithmic strategies, such as dynamic programming, especially for combinatorial problems where counting distinct arrangements is required.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThis function reads an integer input representing the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading two integers, N and K. It calculates the largest integer whose K-th power is less than or equal to N. For each test case, it invokes a counting function to determine the number of ways to express N as a sum of K-th powers of integers, starting from the calculated maximum integer. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to find combinations of unique integers that sum up to a specific number, particularly when those integers are raised to a certain power. This can be applicable in combinatorial mathematics, algorithm design, and optimization problems where constraints on uniqueness and powers are involved. It can also be beneficial in competitive programming and coding interviews where such problems are common."
