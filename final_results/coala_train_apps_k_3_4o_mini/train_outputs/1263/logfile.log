## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The chef was playing with numbers and he found that natural number N can be obtained by sum various unique natural numbers, For challenging himself chef wrote one problem statement, which he decided to solve in future.
Problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
After that Cheffina came and read what chef wrote in the problem statement, for having some fun Cheffina made some changes in the problem statement as.
New problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of unique +ve integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
But, the chef is now confused, how to solve a new problem statement, help the chef to solve this new problem statement.

-----Input:-----
- First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
- Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers $N, K$. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line answer to the problem statement.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq K \leq 6$

-----Sample Input:-----
2
4 1

-----EXPLANATION:-----
For 1) 4 can be obtained by as [ 4^1 ], [1^1, 3^1], [2^1, 2^1]. (here ^ stands for power)
But here [2^1, 2^1] is not the valid way because it is not made up of unique +ve integers. 
For 2) 38 can be obtained in the way which is [2^2, 3^2, 5^2] = 4 + 9 + 25

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem requires us to find the number of unique ways to express a natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of \( K \). Each test case provides values for \( N \) and \( K \), and we need to compute the number of valid combinations for each case.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with backtracking. We will:
   - Generate all possible unique integers whose \( K \)-th powers do not exceed \( N \).
   - Use a recursive function to explore combinations of these integers, checking if their \( K \)-th powers can sum up to \( N \).
   - Keep track of the current sum and the integers used to ensure they are unique.
   - Count the valid combinations that sum to \( N \).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function countWays(N, K):
       initialize a list to store unique integers whose K-th power is <= N
       for i from 1 to the maximum integer such that i^K <= N:
           add i to the list
       
       define a recursive function backtrack(current_sum, start_index):
           if current_sum == N:
               return 1  // found a valid combination
           if current_sum > N:
               return 0  // exceeded the target
           
           count = 0
           for i from start_index to the length of the list:
               count += backtrack(current_sum + list[i]^K, i + 1)  // move to the next integer
           return count
       
       return backtrack(0, 0)  // start with sum 0 and first index

   read T
   for each test case:
       read N, K
       print countWays(N, K)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def countWays(N, K):
    # Generate a list of unique integers whose K-th power is <= N
    unique_numbers = []
    i = 1
    while i ** K <= N:
        unique_numbers.append(i)
        i += 1

    # Recursive function to count the ways to sum to N using unique integers
    def backtrack(current_sum, start_index):
        if current_sum == N:
            return 1  # Found a valid combination
        if current_sum > N:
            return 0  # Exceeded the target
        
        count = 0
        for i in range(start_index, len(unique_numbers)):
            # Include unique_numbers[i] and move to the next index
            count += backtrack(current_sum + unique_numbers[i] ** K, i + 1)
        return count

    return backtrack(0, 0)  # Start with sum 0 and first index

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    # Read N and K for each test case
    N, K = map(int, input().split())
    # Print the result for each test case
    print(countWays(N, K))

    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
           The task is to determine how many subsets can be formed from the numbers 1 to N such that a specific number I appears in the K-th position of the subset when sorted. The output should be the count of such subsets for multiple queries, and since the result can be large, it should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
           To solve this problem, we need to:
           - Understand that for a number I to be in the K-th position of a subset, there must be exactly \(K-1\) numbers less than I in the subset.
           - The remaining numbers in the subset can be chosen from the numbers greater than I.
           - We can use combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of ways to choose \(K-1\) numbers from the \(I-1\) numbers less than I and any number of numbers from the \(N-I\) numbers greater than I.
           - The total number of valid subsets can be calculated using combinations and powers of 2.

        3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
           ```
           function calculate_combinations(n, k):
               if k > n or k < 0:
                   return 0
               return factorial(n) / (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))

           function count_subsets(N, I, K):
               if K > I or K < 1:
                   return 0
               count_less_than_I = calculate_combinations(I - 1, K - 1)
               count_greater_than_I = 2^(N - I)
               return (count_less_than_I * count_greater_than_I) % (10^9 + 7)

           function main():
               read T
               for each test case:
                   read N, Q
                   for each query:
                       read I, K
                       result = count_subsets(N, I, K)
                       print(result)

        def factorial(n):
            if n == 0 or n == 1:
                return 1
            result = 1
            for i in range(2, n + 1):
                result = (result * i) % (10**9 + 7)
            return result

        def calculate_combinations(n, k):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return (factorial(n) * pow(factorial(k), -1, 10**9 + 7) * pow(factorial(n - k), -1, 10**9 + 7)) % (10**9 + 7)

        def count_subsets(N, I, K):

                return 0
            count_less_than_I = calculate_combinations(I - 1, K - 1)
            count_greater_than_I = pow(2, N - I, 10**9 + 7)
            return (count_less_than_I * count_greater_than_I) % (10**9 + 7)

        def main():
            MOD = 10**9 + 7
            T = int(input())
            for _ in range(T):
                N, Q = map(int, input().split())
                for __ in range(Q):
                    I, K = map(int, input().split())
                    result = count_subsets(N, I, K)
                    print(result)

        main()
        ``` 

        This code reads the number of test cases and queries, processes each query to calculate the number of valid subsets, and prints the results. The use of modular arithmetic ensures that we handle large numbers appropriately.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to calculate the number of valid schedules for Chef's restaurant, where dishes must be served over \(N\) days with specific constraints: consecutive days must have different dishes, and the first and last dishes must also be different.

    ### Key Insights:
    1. **Understanding the Combinatorial Nature**: The problem required a combinatorial approach to count valid arrangements based on the number of days. The choices for each day depended on the previous day's choice, leading to a recursive pattern.

    2. **Formulating the Correct Logic**:
       - For \(N = 2\): The valid combinations are \(4 \times 3\).
       - For \(N = 3\): The valid combinations are \(4 \times 3 \times 2\).
       - For \(N \geq 4\): The correct formula should be \(4 \times 3^{(N-1)}\) because:
         - The first day has 4 choices.
         - The second day has 3 choices.
         - Each of the next \(N-2\) days has 3 choices.
         - The last day must be different from the first dish, which is already accounted for in the choices.

    ### Errors and Fixes:
    - Initially, I miscalculated the formula for \(N \geq 4\) by incorrectly considering the last dish's constraints. The correct approach was to ensure that the last dish is different from the first while maintaining the choices for the middle days.
    - The final formula for \(N \geq 4\) was adjusted to correctly reflect the choices available.

    ### Final Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def calculate_schedules(N):
        if N == 2:
            return (4 * 3) % (10**9 + 7)
        elif N == 3:
            return (4 * 3 * 2) % (10**9 + 7)
        else:
            return (4 * 3 * (3 ** (N - 2))) % (10**9 + 7)

    def main():
        T = int(input())
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            result = calculate_schedules(N)
            print(result)

[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... for multiple test cases. Initially, I attempted to derive a formula for the series but mistakenly used an incorrect formula that did not correspond to the series, leading to incorrect outputs.

    Upon analyzing the series, I identified that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, which led to the realization that the N'th term could be computed as the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares. The correct formula for the N'th term is:
    - T(N) = (N-1) * N * (2(N-1) + 1) / 6

    This formula was derived from the known formula for the sum of squares. After implementing this corrected formula, the code produced the expected results for all test cases.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(N):
        if N == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1) // 6

    def main():
        T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N
            result = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            print(result)  # Output the result

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring that the derived formulas are correct before implementation.

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] 1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
   The task is to find out how many different ways we can express a natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of \( K \). Each way of expressing \( N \) must use distinct integers.

2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with memoization. The idea is to:
   - Start from the largest integer whose \( K \)-th power is less than or equal to \( N \).
   - For each integer, decide whether to include it in the sum or not.
   - If included, subtract its \( K \)-th power from \( N \) and continue the process with the next smaller integer.
   - If not included, simply continue with the next smaller integer.
   - Use memoization to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine the number of ways to express a natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power \( K \). The approach involved using recursion with memoization to efficiently explore the combinations of integers.

The core concept tested was the ability to recursively break down the problem by deciding whether to include or exclude each integer in the sum. The recursive function `count_ways(N, K, max_num)` was designed to handle this, checking for base cases where \( N \) is zero (indicating a valid combination) or negative (indicating an invalid combination).

The implementation successfully handled the sample inputs, producing the correct outputs. The key strategy that worked well was calculating the maximum integer whose \( K \)-th power is less than or equal to \( N \), which helped limit the recursion depth and avoid unnecessary calculations.

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of recursive problem-solving techniques and the utility of memoization in optimizing performance for combinatorial problems. The final code snippet effectively encapsulated the solution:

```python
def count_ways(N, K, max_num):
    if N == 0:
        return 1  # Found a valid way
    if N < 0 or max_num <= 0:
        return 0  # No valid way
    
    power = max_num ** K
    return count_ways(N - power, K, max_num - 1) + count_ways(N, K, max_num - 1)

def main():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):

        max_num = int(N ** (1/K))
        result = count_ways(N, K, max_num)
        print(result)

```

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] The official solution employs a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of finding the number of ways to express a number \( N \) as the sum of unique integers raised to the power \( K \). Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The solution uses an array `reach` where `reach[j]` keeps track of the number of ways to form the sum \( j \) using the unique integers raised to the power \( K \). The array is initialized with `reach[0] = 1`, indicating that there is one way to form the sum of zero (by using no numbers).

2. **Iterating Over Powers**: The outer loop iterates over integers \( i \) starting from 1, calculating \( i^n \) (the \( K \)-th power of \( i \)). The loop continues until \( i^n \) exceeds \( N \).

3. **Updating the DP Array**: For each power \( i^n \), the inner loop iterates backward through the `reach` array. This backward iteration ensures that each integer is only used once in forming the sums, maintaining the uniqueness constraint.

4. **Final Result**: After processing all integers up to the maximum possible \( i \), the final result is found in `reach[N]`, which gives the total number of ways to express \( N \) as the sum of unique integers raised to the power \( K \).

### Key Takeaways:
- The dynamic programming approach is efficient for this problem, as it avoids the overhead of recursion and memoization.
- The backward iteration in the DP array is crucial for ensuring that each integer is only counted once in each combination.
- The solution effectively handles the constraints provided, making it suitable for the given problem size.

This experience highlights the importance of considering different algorithmic strategies, such as dynamic programming, especially for combinatorial problems where counting distinct arrangements is required.

[Problem]
    The chef was playing with numbers and he found that natural number N can be obtained by sum various unique natural numbers, For challenging himself chef wrote one problem statement, which he decided to solve in future.
    Problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
    After that Cheffina came and read what chef wrote in the problem statement, for having some fun Cheffina made some changes in the problem statement as.
    New problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of unique +ve integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
    But, the chef is now confused, how to solve a new problem statement, help the chef to solve this new problem statement.

    -----Input:-----
    - First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
    - Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers $N, K$. 

    -----Output:-----
    For each test case, output in a single line answer to the problem statement.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 10$
    - $1 \leq N \leq 1000$
    - $1 \leq K \leq 6$

    -----Sample Input:-----
    2
    4 1
    38 2

    -----Sample Output:-----
    2
    1

    -----EXPLANATION:-----
    For 1) 4 can be obtained by as [ 4^1 ], [1^1, 3^1], [2^1, 2^1]. (here ^ stands for power)
    But here [2^1, 2^1] is not the valid way because it is not made up of unique +ve integers. 
    For 2) 38 can be obtained in the way which is [2^2, 3^2, 5^2] = 4 + 9 + 25
