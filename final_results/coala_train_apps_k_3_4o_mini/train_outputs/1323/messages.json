This route runs the entire length of Siruseri and passes through many of the big cities and a large number of small towns and villages in Siruseri.\nThe railway stations along this route have all been constructed keeping in mind the comfort of the travellers. Every station has big parking lots, comfortable waiting rooms and plenty of space for eateries. The railway authorities would like to contract out the catering services of these eateries.\nThe Siruseri Economic Survey has done a through feasibility study of the different stations and documented the expected profits (or losses) for the eateries in all the railway stations on this route. The authorities would like to ensure that every station is catered to. To prevent caterers from bidding only for profitable stations, the authorities have decided to give out catering contracts for contiguous segments of stations.\nThe minister in charge realises that one of the bidders is his bitter adversary and he has decided to hand out as useless a segment as possible to him. On the other hand, he does not want to be seen to be blatantly unfair by handing out a large loss-making section to the adversary. Instead he wants to find the largest segment whose sum is closest to $0$, so that his adversary spends all his time running a large number of canteens and makes either a small loss or a small profit or, even better, nothing at all!\nIn other words, if the profits/losses at the stations are $p_1, p_2, ..., p_N$ the minister would like to handover a sequence $i, i+1, ..., j$ such that the absolute value of $p_i + p_{i+1} + ... + p_j$ is minimized. If there is more than one sequence with this minimum absolute value then he would like to hand over the longest one.\nFor example, suppose there are $8$ stations along the line and their profitability is as follows:\n$ $\nStation              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8 \nExpected Profits   -20   90  -30  -20   80  -70  -60  125 \n\n$ $\nIf the adversary is awarded the section $1$ through $4$, he will make a net profit of $20$. On the other hand if he is given stations $6, 7$ and $8$, he will make loss of $5$ rupees. This is the best possible value.\n\n-----Input:-----\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $N$ indicating the number of stations. The next $N$ lines (lines $2, 3, ..., N+1$) describe the profitability of the $N$ stations. Line $i+1$ contains a single integer denoting the expected profit at station $i$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nThe first line contains a single integer indicating the minimum possible profit/loss among all segments. The second line contains two integers indicating the starting and ending point of the longest sequence with this minimum profit/loss. If there is more than one answer, it suffices to print one.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 100000$.\n- $-10^9 \\leq p_i \\leq 10^9$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask 1 - 40% - $1 \\leq N \\leq 4000$\n- Subtask 2 - 60% - Original constraints\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n8\n-20\n90\n-30\n-20\n80\n-70\n-60\n125\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n-5\n6 8\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

They want to find a contiguous segment of stations such that the total profit or loss for that segment is as close to zero as possible. If there are multiple segments with the same minimum absolute profit/loss, they prefer the longest segment.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can use a prefix sum approach. We will calculate the cumulative sum of profits/losses as we iterate through the list of stations.

Each query specified a range of indices, and the goal was to return the sum of the values within that range for each query. The problem involved handling multiple test cases efficiently.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to read input, process ranges, and compute sums. A straightforward approach was to use Python's built-in `sum()` function to calculate the sum for each query directly from the list slice. This method worked well given the constraints, as it allowed for clear and concise code.\n\n    The final implementation involved reading the number of test cases, followed by reading the number of bills and queries for each test case. For each query, I extracted the specified range and computed the sum, storing the results for output. The solution was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints without performance issues.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding input/output handling and efficient range summation techniques in competitive programming. The solution was successful, and no unexpected errors were encountered during implementation.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In solving the problem of finding a permutation \\( P \\) such that \\( f(P) = K \\), I learned several key concepts and strategies. The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximums of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a descending permutation is \\( N \\times (N - 1) \\). This insight was crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a given \\( K \\).\n\n    Initially, my approach to calculating the maximum value and adjusting the permutation was flawed. I incorrectly calculated the maximum possible value and did not implement a clear strategy for adjusting the permutation to reach \\( K \\). The adjustment logic involved swapping adjacent elements, but it lacked a systematic approach to ensure that the desired \\( K \\) could be achieved.\n\n    After revising the code, I implemented a more structured approach: I calculated the maximum value correctly, checked if \\( K \\) was feasible, and then constructed a descending permutation. I iteratively adjusted the permutation by swapping elements while recalculating \\( f(P) \\) until it matched \\( K \\) or determined it was impossible.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, input().split())\n            max_value = N * (N - 1)\n        \n            if K > max_value:\n                print(-1)\n                continue\n        \n            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n            current_f = sum(max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1]) for i in range(N - 1))\n        \n            for i in range(N - 1):\n                if current_f > K:\n                    if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:\n                        permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                        current_f = sum(max(permutation[j], permutation[j + 1]) for j in range(N - 1))\n            \n                if current_f == K:\n                    break\n        \n            if current_f == K:\n                print(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n            else:\n                print(-1)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    find_permutation(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of clearly understanding the problem constraints and systematically approaching adjustments in permutations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a permutation of books numbered from 1 to N. The key insight was to leverage the concept of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). The minimum moves needed to sort the books can be calculated as the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.\n\n    Initially, the solution focused on the logic for calculating the LIS but failed to include necessary input/output handling, which is crucial for execution in a competitive programming environment. The main issues were the lack of input reading, the absence of function invocation, and the failure to convert input strings into the appropriate data types.\n\n    The final solution involved defining a binary search function to efficiently find positions in the LIS and a main function to compute the minimum moves. The corrected code successfully handled input and output, ensuring it worked as expected in the testing environment.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final working code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def binary_search(lis, book):\n        left, right = 0, len(lis)\n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            if lis[mid] < book:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid\n        return left\n\n    def minMovesToSort(N, books):\n        lis = []\n        for book in books:\n            pos = binary_search(lis, book)\n            if pos < len(lis):\n                lis[pos] = book\n            else:\n                lis.append(book)\n        return N - len(lis)\n\n    N = int(input().strip())\n    books = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))\n    print(minMovesToSort(N, books))\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of considering input/output requirements in coding challenges and highlighted the effectiveness of using LIS to solve sorting problems efficiently.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Each query specified a range of indices, and the goal was to return the sum of the values within that range for each query. The problem involved handling multiple test cases efficiently.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to read input, process ranges, and compute sums. A straightforward approach was to use Python's built-in `sum()` function to calculate the sum for each query directly from the list slice. This method worked well given the constraints, as it allowed for clear and concise code.\n\n    The final implementation involved reading the number of test cases, followed by reading the number of bills and queries for each test case. For each query, I extracted the specified range and computed the sum, storing the results for output. The solution was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints without performance issues.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding input/output handling and efficient range summation techniques in competitive programming. The solution was successful, and no unexpected errors were encountered during implementation.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a permutation of books numbered from 1 to N. The key insight was to leverage the concept of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). The minimum moves needed to sort the books can be calculated as the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.\n\n    Initially, the solution focused on the logic for calculating the LIS but failed to include necessary input/output handling, which is crucial for execution in a competitive programming environment. The main issues were the lack of input reading, the absence of function invocation, and the failure to convert input strings into the appropriate data types.\n\n    The final solution involved defining a binary search function to efficiently find positions in the LIS and a main function to compute the minimum moves. The corrected code successfully handled input and output, ensuring it worked as expected in the testing environment.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final working code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def binary_search(lis, book):\n        left, right = 0, len(lis)\n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            if lis[mid] < book:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid\n        return left\n\n    def minMovesToSort(N, books):\n        lis = []\n        for book in books:\n            pos = binary_search(lis, book)\n            if pos < len(lis):\n                lis[pos] = book\n            else:\n                lis.append(book)\n        return N - len(lis)\n\n    N = int(input().strip())\n    books = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))\n    print(minMovesToSort(N, books))\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of considering input/output requirements in coding challenges and highlighted the effectiveness of using LIS to solve sorting problems efficiently.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximums of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a descending permutation is \\( N \\times (N - 1) \\). This insight was crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a given \\( K \\).\n\n    Initially, my approach to calculating the maximum value and adjusting the permutation was flawed. I incorrectly calculated the maximum possible value and did not implement a clear strategy for adjusting the permutation to reach \\( K \\). The adjustment logic involved swapping adjacent elements, but it lacked a systematic approach to ensure that the desired \\( K \\) could be achieved.\n\n    After revising the code, I implemented a more structured approach: I calculated the maximum value correctly, checked if \\( K \\) was feasible, and then constructed a descending permutation. I iteratively adjusted the permutation by swapping elements while recalculating \\( f(P) \\) until it matched \\( K \\) or determined it was impossible.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, input().split())\n            max_value = N * (N - 1)\n        \n            if K > max_value:\n                print(-1)\n                continue\n        \n            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n            current_f = sum(max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1]) for i in range(N - 1))\n        \n            for i in range(N - 1):\n                if current_f > K:\n                    if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:\n                        permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                        current_f = sum(max(permutation[j], permutation[j + 1]) for j in range(N - 1))\n            \n                if current_f == K:\n                    break\n        \n            if current_f == K:\n                print(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n            else:\n                print(-1)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    find_permutation(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of clearly understanding the problem constraints and systematically approaching adjustments in permutations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Nexus 4.O is going to be organized by ASME, GLA University.

Each query specified a range of indices, and the goal was to return the sum of the values within that range for each query. The problem involved handling multiple test cases efficiently.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to read input, process ranges, and compute sums. A straightforward approach was to use Python's built-in `sum()` function to calculate the sum for each query directly from the list slice. This method worked well given the constraints, as it allowed for clear and concise code.\n\n    The final implementation involved reading the number of test cases, followed by reading the number of bills and queries for each test case. For each query, I extracted the specified range and computed the sum, storing the results for output. The solution was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints without performance issues.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding input/output handling and efficient range summation techniques in competitive programming. The solution was successful, and no unexpected errors were encountered during implementation.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

We also initialize variables to track the minimum absolute sum, the best start and end indices, and the maximum length of the segment found.\n\n2. **Iterating through Profits**: For each profit value, we update the prefix sum. We check if the prefix sum is zero and update the best segment if it is.\n\n3. **Checking Previous Prefix Sums**: We check if the current prefix sum has been seen before. If it has, we calculate the length of the segment and update the best values if necessary.\n\n4. **Output**: Finally, we print the minimum absolute sum and the 1-based indices of the best segment.\n\nThis code should now correctly handle the input and output as specified, ensuring that we find the segment with the sum closest to zero and return the correct indices."

This allows for quick updates and checks against previously seen prefix sums, which is crucial for maintaining performance.\n\n2. **Tracking Indices**: The solution maintains a separate list of indices corresponding to the prefix sums. This is essential for determining the start and end of the segments that yield the closest sum to zero.\n\n3. **Dynamic Updates**: The solution dynamically updates the minimum absolute sum and the corresponding segment indices as it processes each profit value. It checks both the current prefix sum and the differences between adjacent prefix sums to ensure that it captures all potential segments.\n\n4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution effectively handles cases where the prefix sum is zero or when multiple segments yield the same minimum absolute sum by comparing lengths.\n\n### Reasons for My Approach's Failure:\n- **Incorrect Logic for Closest Sum**: My implementation attempted to check for the closest sum to zero using a nested loop over previously seen prefix sums, which was inefficient and led to incorrect results.\n- **Output Formatting Issues**: I failed to correctly manage the output format, particularly in converting indices to a 1-based format, which caused discrepancies in the expected output.\n- **Inefficient Handling of Prefix Sums**: My approach did not leverage the efficiency of maintaining a sorted list of prefix sums, leading to unnecessary complexity and potential errors in segment identification.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe official solution's use of binary search and dynamic updates provides a more efficient and effective way to solve the problem. In future attempts, I will focus on leveraging data structures that allow for efficient searching and updating, as well as ensuring that I handle edge cases and output formatting correctly."
