    "summary": "In solving the problem of finding a permutation \\( P \\) such that \\( f(P) = K \\), I learned several key concepts and strategies. The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximums of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a descending permutation is \\( N \\times (N - 1) \\). This insight was crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a given \\( K \\).\n\nInitially, my approach to calculating the maximum value and adjusting the permutation was flawed. I incorrectly calculated the maximum possible value and did not implement a clear strategy for adjusting the permutation to reach \\( K \\). The adjustment logic involved swapping adjacent elements, but it lacked a systematic approach to ensure that the desired \\( K \\) could be achieved.\n\nAfter revising the code, I implemented a more structured approach: I calculated the maximum value correctly, checked if \\( K \\) was feasible, and then constructed a descending permutation. I iteratively adjusted the permutation by swapping elements while recalculating \\( f(P) \\) until it matched \\( K \\) or determined it was impossible.\n\nThe final working code is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef find_permutation(T):\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        max_value = N * (N - 1)\n        \n        if K > max_value:\n            print(-1)\n            continue\n        \n        permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n        current_f = sum(max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1]) for i in range(N - 1))\n        \n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            if current_f > K:\n                if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:\n                    permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                    current_f = sum(max(permutation[j], permutation[j + 1]) for j in range(N - 1))\n            \n            if current_f == K:\n                break\n        \n        if current_f == K:\n            print(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n        else:\n            print(-1)\n\nT = int(input())\nfind_permutation(T)\n```\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of clearly understanding the problem constraints and systematically approaching adjustments in permutations.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\nIn my attempts to solve the problem of finding a permutation \\( P \\) such that \\( f(P) = K \\), I learned several key insights about the problem's structure and the requirements for generating valid permutations.\n\n1. **Understanding the Function \\( f(P) \\)**: The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximums of adjacent pairs in the permutation. This means that the arrangement of numbers significantly affects the output. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a descending permutation is \\( N \\times (N - 1) \\), which I initially miscalculated. The official solution correctly identifies the bounds for \\( K \\) based on the properties of permutations.\n\n2. **Feasibility Conditions**: The official solution includes specific conditions to check if \\( K \\) is achievable based on the parity of \\( N \\) (even or odd). This is a crucial insight that I overlooked. The conditions ensure that \\( K \\) falls within a valid range, which is determined by the maximum and minimum possible values of \\( f(P) \\).\n\n3. **Constructing the Permutation**: The official solution employs a more systematic approach to construct the permutation. It uses a combination of arithmetic adjustments and indexing to fill in the permutation array, ensuring that the desired \\( f(P) \\) is achieved. My approach relied on simple swaps, which was insufficient for reaching the target \\( K \\) effectively.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient in both time and space complexity, leveraging direct calculations and array manipulations without unnecessary recomputation of \\( f(P) \\) after each swap. This contrasts with my approach, which recalculated \\( f(P) \\) multiple times, leading to inefficiencies.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n- Always consider the mathematical properties of the problem, such as maximum and minimum bounds, before attempting to construct a solution.\n- Pay attention to the parity of inputs, as it can significantly affect the feasibility of the solution.\n- Use systematic approaches to construct solutions rather than relying on trial-and-error methods like swapping, which may not yield the desired results efficiently.\n- Understanding the problem deeply can lead to more elegant and efficient solutions, as demonstrated by the official solution.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: find_permutation]\nThe function processes multiple test cases to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N that achieves a specific value K based on a defined function f(P). It first calculates the maximum possible value of f(P) for a descending permutation and checks if K exceeds this maximum, in which case it outputs -1. If K is valid, it initializes a descending permutation and calculates its current f(P) value. The function then attempts to adjust the permutation by swapping adjacent elements to reduce the f(P) value until it matches K or it determines that it's not possible. Finally, it prints the resulting permutation if the desired value is achieved, or -1 if it cannot be reached.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to generate permutations of a set of numbers while adhering to specific constraints on a derived function from those permutations. It can be applied in combinatorial optimization problems, algorithm design for competitive programming, and situations where understanding the properties of permutations is crucial, such as in scheduling, resource allocation, or game theory. The ability to determine if a valid permutation exists for given parameters can help in decision-making processes in various fields, including computer science and mathematics."
