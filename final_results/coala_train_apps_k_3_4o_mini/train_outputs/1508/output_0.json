    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The task is to generate a specific pattern based on an integer input \\( K \\). For each test case, we need to print a pattern of numbers that starts from 0 and goes up to \\( K-1 \\) in a specific arrangement. The output for each test case should consist of \\( K \\) lines, where each line contains a sequence of numbers that decreases from the current line number down to 0, and then increases back up to the current line number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   - Read the number of test cases \\( T \\).\n   - For each test case, read the integer \\( K \\).\n   - For each integer \\( K \\), generate \\( K \\) lines of output.\n   - For each line \\( i \\) (where \\( i \\) ranges from 0 to \\( K-1 \\)):\n     - Print numbers starting from 0 up to \\( i \\) (inclusive).\n     - Then print numbers starting from \\( i-1 \\) down to 0 (inclusive).\n   - Print the results for each test case.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function print_pattern(T):\n       for each test case in T:\n           read K\n           for i from 0 to K-1:\n               line = []\n               for j from 0 to i:\n                   append j to line\n               for j from i-1 down to 0:\n                   append j to line\n               print line as a string\n\n   read T\n   print_pattern(T)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef print_pattern(T):\n    # Loop through each test case\n    for _ in range(T):\n        K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case\n        # Loop to generate each line of the pattern\n        for i in range(K):\n            line = []  # Initialize an empty list to hold the current line's numbers\n            # Append numbers from 0 to i\n            for j in range(i + 1):\n                line.append(str(j))\n            # Append numbers from i-1 down to 0\n            for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):\n                line.append(str(j))\n            # Print the current line as a string\n            print(''.join(line))\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nprint_pattern(T)  # Call the function to print the patterns for all test cases\n```",
