    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   Chef has a row of cells where he places magnets, pieces of iron, and other objects. The goal is to determine how many magnets can attract pieces of iron based on certain conditions. A magnet can attract a piece of iron if they are not blocked by any obstacles, and the attraction power between them must be positive. The attraction power is calculated based on the distance between the magnet and the iron, the number of conducting sheets in between, and a given constant.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the string representing the cells and identify the positions of magnets and pieces of iron. We will then check the conditions for attraction between each magnet and iron piece, taking into account any blocked cells and conducting sheets. We will maintain a count of successful attractions and ensure that each magnet and iron piece can only be used once.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function max_magnets(T):\n       for each test case:\n           read N and K\n           read string S\n           initialize count of attractions to 0\n           initialize lists for magnets and irons\n           initialize a variable to track the last position of a blocked cell\n           \n           for each character in S:\n               if character is 'M':\n                   add the index to magnets list\n               else if character is 'I':\n                   add the index to irons list\n               else if character is 'X':\n                   process magnets and irons lists to find attractions\n                   clear magnets and irons lists\n                   reset last blocked position\n           \n           process remaining magnets and irons after the loop\n           print the count of attractions\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef max_magnets(T):\n    for _ in range(T):\n        # Read the number of cells and the constant K\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        # Read the string representing the cells\n        S = input().strip()\n        \n        # Initialize variables to track magnets and irons\n        magnets = []\n        irons = []\n        count = 0\n        last_blocked = -1\n        \n        # Iterate through the string S\n        for i in range(N):\n            if S[i] == 'M':\n                magnets.append(i)  # Store the index of magnets\n            elif S[i] == 'I':\n                irons.append(i)  # Store the index of irons\n            elif S[i] == 'X':\n                # Process the current magnets and irons when a block is encountered\n                count += process_attractions(magnets, irons, K, last_blocked)\n                magnets.clear()  # Clear magnets for the next segment\n                irons.clear()    # Clear irons for the next segment\n                last_blocked = i  # Update the last blocked position\n        \n        # Process any remaining magnets and irons after the loop\n        count += process_attractions(magnets, irons, K, last_blocked)\n        \n        # Print the total count of attractions\n        print(count)\n\ndef process_attractions(magnets, irons, K, last_blocked):\n    count = 0\n    # Iterate through magnets and irons to calculate attractions\n    for m in magnets:\n        for i in irons:\n            if m < last_blocked and i < last_blocked:\n                # Calculate the attraction power\n                distance = abs(m - i)\n                sheets = count_sheets_between(S, m, i)\n                power = K + 1 - distance - sheets\n                if power > 0:\n                    count += 1\n                    irons.remove(i)  # Remove the iron once attracted\n                    break  # Move to the next magnet\n    return count\n\ndef count_sheets_between(S, m, i):\n    # Count the number of conducting sheets between indices m and i\n    return S[min(m, i) + 1:max(m, i)].count(':')\n\nT = int(input())\nmax_magnets(T)\n```",
