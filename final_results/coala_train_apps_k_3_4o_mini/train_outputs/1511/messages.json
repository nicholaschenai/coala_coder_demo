He took a row of $N$ cells (numbered $1$ through $N$) and placed some objects in some of these cells. You are given a string $S$ with length $N$ describing them; for each valid $i$, the $i$-th character of $S$ is one of the following:\n- 'I' if the $i$-th cell contains a piece of iron\n- 'M' if the $i$-th cell contains a magnet\n- '_' if the $i$-th cell is empty\n- ':' if the $i$-th cell contains a conducting sheet\n- 'X' if the $i$-th cell is blocked\nIf there is a magnet in a cell $i$ and iron in a cell $j$, the attraction power between these cells is $P_{i,j} = K+1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j}$, where $S_{i,j}$ is the number of cells containing sheets between cells $i$ and $j$. This magnet can only attract this iron if $P_{i, j} > 0$ and there are no blocked cells between the cells $i$ and $j$.\nChef wants to choose some magnets (possibly none) and to each of these magnets, assign a piece of iron which this magnet should attract. Each piece of iron may only be attracted by at most one magnet and only if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them. Find the maximum number of magnets Chef can choose.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.\n- The second line contains a single string $S$ with length $N$.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2015 the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 2,000$\n- $1 \\le N \\le 10^5$\n- $0 \\le K \\le 10^5$\n- $S$ contains only characters 'I', 'M', '_', ':' and 'X'\n- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \\cdot 10^6$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (30 points): there are no sheets, i.e. $S$ does not contain the character ':'\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n-----Example Input-----\n2\n4 5\nI::M\n9 10\nMIM_XII:M\n\n-----Example Output-----\n1\n2\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1: The attraction power between the only magnet and the only piece of iron is $5+1-3-2 = 1$. Note that it decreases with distance and the number of sheets.\nExample case 2:\nThe magnets in cells $1$ and $3$ can attract the piece of iron in cell $2$, since the attraction power is $10$ in both cases. They cannot attract iron in cells $6$ or $7$ because there is a wall between them.\nThe magnet in cell $9$ can attract the pieces of iron in cells $7$ and $6$; the attraction power is $8$ and $7$ respectively.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The goal is to determine how many magnets can attract pieces of iron based on a specific attraction formula. The attraction depends on the distance between the magnet and the iron, the number of conducting sheets in between, and a given constant K. A magnet can only attract a piece of iron if the attraction power is positive and there are no blocked cells between them.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   We need to process multiple test cases.

The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximums of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a descending permutation is \\( N \\times (N - 1) \\). This insight was crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a given \\( K \\).\n\n    Initially, my approach to calculating the maximum value and adjusting the permutation was flawed. I incorrectly calculated the maximum possible value and did not implement a clear strategy for adjusting the permutation to reach \\( K \\). The adjustment logic involved swapping adjacent elements, but it lacked a systematic approach to ensure that the desired \\( K \\) could be achieved.\n\n    After revising the code, I implemented a more structured approach: I calculated the maximum value correctly, checked if \\( K \\) was feasible, and then constructed a descending permutation. I iteratively adjusted the permutation by swapping elements while recalculating \\( f(P) \\) until it matched \\( K \\) or determined it was impossible.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, input().split())\n            max_value = N * (N - 1)\n        \n            if K > max_value:\n                print(-1)\n                continue\n        \n            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n            current_f = sum(max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1]) for i in range(N - 1))\n        \n            for i in range(N - 1):\n                if current_f > K:\n                    if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:\n                        permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                        current_f = sum(max(permutation[j], permutation[j + 1]) for j in range(N - 1))\n            \n                if current_f == K:\n                    break\n        \n            if current_f == K:\n                print(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n            else:\n                print(-1)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    find_permutation(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of clearly understanding the problem constraints and systematically approaching adjustments in permutations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element by its index any number of times. The key insight was that the total sum of the sequence must be less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, and it must also be non-negative to reach zero.\n\n    Initially, the solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it could always be made zero. This was a flawed assumption because it did not account for the possibility of the total sum being negative, which would make it impossible to reach zero.\n\n    The corrected approach involved:\n    1. Calculating the total sum of the sequence.\n    2. Calculating the maximum reduction possible using the formula for the sum of the first `N` natural numbers.\n    3. Checking both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction and must be non-negative.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total_sum = sum(A)\n            max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))\n        \n            if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    can_make_good_sequence(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all conditions that affect the outcome, especially when dealing with sums and reductions.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to calculate the maximum strength of an army formed by Pok\u00e9mon strengths using an alternating sum formula. The alternating sum is defined as \\( a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \\ldots \\). The challenge was to maximize this sum based on the original arrangement of strengths without any swap operations.\n\n    Initially, I misunderstood the requirement and attempted to calculate the alternating sum based on the sorted strengths rather than the original order. This led to incorrect outputs, as the alternating sum should reflect the optimal selection of strengths from the original list. The correct approach involved sorting the strengths in descending order and then applying the alternating sum formula based on the sorted list.\n\n    The final solution correctly implemented this logic by sorting the strengths and calculating the maximum alternating sum by adding strengths at even indices and subtracting those at odd indices. However, despite these corrections, the solution still failed to produce the expected results, indicating a deeper misunderstanding of how to select strengths optimally.\n\n    Key Takeaways:\n    - The alternating sum needs to be calculated based on the optimal selection of strengths, not just their positions.\n    - Sorting the strengths in descending order is essential for maximizing the alternating sum.\n    - Careful attention to the problem requirements is crucial to avoid logical errors in implementation.\n\n    Final Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def calculate_max_strength(t):\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n, q = map(int, input().split())\n            strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            strengths.sort(reverse=True)\n            max_strength = 0\n            for index in range(n):\n                if index % 2 == 0:\n                    max_strength += strengths[index]\n                else:\n                    max_strength -= strengths[index]\n            print(max_strength)\n\n    t = int(input())\n    calculate_max_strength(t)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and the need for careful implementation to achieve the desired results.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

I did not account for the blocked cells properly when iterating through magnets and irons.\n   - The removal of attracted irons from the list was not handled correctly, which could lead to incorrect counts if multiple magnets were trying to attract the same iron.\n   - The logic for counting sheets was not being called correctly, and the function was not integrated properly into the main attraction logic.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. **Iterate through the string** and collect magnets and irons until a blocked cell is encountered.\n2. **For each segment** (between blocked cells), calculate the attraction power for each magnet and iron pair.\n3. **Count valid attractions** based on the attraction power and ensure that each magnet and iron can only be used once.\n4. **Reset the lists** of magnets and irons when a blocked cell is encountered and process the remaining pairs after the loop.\n\n### Revised Code:\n```python\ndef max_magnets(T):\n    for _ in range(T):\n        # Read the number of cells and the constant K\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        # Read the string representing the cells\n        S = input().strip()\n        \n        # Initialize variables to track magnets and irons\n        magnets = []\n        irons = []\n        count = 0\n        \n        # Iterate through the string S\n        for i in range(N):\n            if S[i] == 'M':\n                magnets.append(i)  # Store the index of magnets\n            elif S[i] == 'I':\n                irons.append(i)  # Store the index of irons\n            elif S[i] == 'X':\n                # Process the current magnets and irons when a block is encountered\n                count += process_attractions(magnets, irons, K)\n                magnets.clear()  # Clear magnets for the next segment\n                irons.clear()    # Clear irons for the next segment\n        \n        # Process any remaining magnets and irons after the loop\n        count += process_attractions(magnets, irons, K)\n        \n        # Print the total count of attractions\n        print(count)\n\ndef process_attractions(magnets, irons, K):\n    count = 0\n    used_irons = set()  # To track used irons\n    # Iterate through magnets and irons to calculate attractions\n    for m in magnets:\n        for i in irons:\n            if i not in used_irons:  # Check if the iron is already used\n                # Calculate the attraction power\n                distance = abs(m - i)\n                sheets = count_sheets_between(S, m, i)\n                power = K + 1 - distance - sheets\n                if power > 0:\n                    count += 1\n                    used_irons.add(i)  # Mark this iron as used\n                    break  # Move to the next magnet\n    return count\n\ndef count_sheets_between(S, m, i):\n    # Count the number of conducting sheets between indices m and i\n    return S[min(m, i) + 1:max(m, i)].count(':')\n\nT = int(input())\nmax_magnets(T)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- Added a `used_irons` set to track which irons have already been attracted.\n- Ensured that the attraction power calculation is correctly applied and checked.\n- Cleared the magnets and irons lists correctly when a blocked cell is encountered. \n\nThis should address the issues and allow the code to pass the tests."

The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximums of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a descending permutation is \\( N \\times (N - 1) \\). This insight was crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a given \\( K \\).\n\n    Initially, my approach to calculating the maximum value and adjusting the permutation was flawed. I incorrectly calculated the maximum possible value and did not implement a clear strategy for adjusting the permutation to reach \\( K \\). The adjustment logic involved swapping adjacent elements, but it lacked a systematic approach to ensure that the desired \\( K \\) could be achieved.\n\n    After revising the code, I implemented a more structured approach: I calculated the maximum value correctly, checked if \\( K \\) was feasible, and then constructed a descending permutation. I iteratively adjusted the permutation by swapping elements while recalculating \\( f(P) \\) until it matched \\( K \\) or determined it was impossible.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, input().split())\n            max_value = N * (N - 1)\n        \n            if K > max_value:\n                print(-1)\n                continue\n        \n            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n            current_f = sum(max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1]) for i in range(N - 1))\n        \n            for i in range(N - 1):\n                if current_f > K:\n                    if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:\n                        permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                        current_f = sum(max(permutation[j], permutation[j + 1]) for j in range(N - 1))\n            \n                if current_f == K:\n                    break\n        \n            if current_f == K:\n                print(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n            else:\n                print(-1)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    find_permutation(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of clearly understanding the problem constraints and systematically approaching adjustments in permutations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to calculate the maximum strength of an army formed by Pok\u00e9mon strengths using an alternating sum formula. The alternating sum is defined as \\( a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \\ldots \\). The challenge was to maximize this sum based on the original arrangement of strengths without any swap operations.\n\n    Initially, I misunderstood the requirement and attempted to calculate the alternating sum based on the sorted strengths rather than the original order. This led to incorrect outputs, as the alternating sum should reflect the optimal selection of strengths from the original list. The correct approach involved sorting the strengths in descending order and then applying the alternating sum formula based on the sorted list.\n\n    The final solution correctly implemented this logic by sorting the strengths and calculating the maximum alternating sum by adding strengths at even indices and subtracting those at odd indices. However, despite these corrections, the solution still failed to produce the expected results, indicating a deeper misunderstanding of how to select strengths optimally.\n\n    Key Takeaways:\n    - The alternating sum needs to be calculated based on the optimal selection of strengths, not just their positions.\n    - Sorting the strengths in descending order is essential for maximizing the alternating sum.\n    - Careful attention to the problem requirements is crucial to avoid logical errors in implementation.\n\n    Final Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def calculate_max_strength(t):\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n, q = map(int, input().split())\n            strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            strengths.sort(reverse=True)\n            max_strength = 0\n            for index in range(n):\n                if index % 2 == 0:\n                    max_strength += strengths[index]\n                else:\n                    max_strength -= strengths[index]\n            print(max_strength)\n\n    t = int(input())\n    calculate_max_strength(t)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and the need for careful implementation to achieve the desired results.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element by its index any number of times. The key insight was that the total sum of the sequence must be less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, and it must also be non-negative to reach zero.\n\n    Initially, the solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it could always be made zero. This was a flawed assumption because it did not account for the possibility of the total sum being negative, which would make it impossible to reach zero.\n\n    The corrected approach involved:\n    1. Calculating the total sum of the sequence.\n    2. Calculating the maximum reduction possible using the formula for the sum of the first `N` natural numbers.\n    3. Checking both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction and must be non-negative.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total_sum = sum(A)\n            max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))\n        \n            if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    can_make_good_sequence(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all conditions that affect the outcome, especially when dealing with sums and reductions.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

My approach involved calculating the attraction power based on distance and the number of conducting sheets between them. However, my solution struggled with correctly handling the blocked cells and ensuring that each magnet and iron could only be used once, which led to incorrect counts in some cases.\n\nThe official solution provided a more efficient and straightforward approach. It utilized two pointers (`i` for magnets and `j` for irons) to traverse the string simultaneously. This method allowed for a more direct comparison between magnets and irons while efficiently counting the conducting sheets between them. The key steps in the official solution included:\n\n1. **Two-Pointer Technique**: By maintaining two pointers, the solution could easily navigate through the string without needing to store all magnets and irons in separate lists. This reduced space complexity and simplified the logic.\n  \n2. **Handling Blocked Cells**: The official solution effectively managed blocked cells by resetting the pointers when an 'X' was encountered, ensuring that no invalid attractions were counted.\n\n3. **Attraction Power Calculation**: The calculation of attraction power was done inline, immediately after identifying a magnet and an iron, which streamlined the process and avoided unnecessary complexity.\n\n4. **Incrementing Pointers**: The solution incremented the pointers based on the conditions of attraction power, ensuring that it always moved forward in the string without missing potential matches.\n\nOverall, the official solution's use of a two-pointer technique and its efficient handling of the string traversal provided a clearer and more effective method for solving the problem. This experience highlighted the importance of considering different traversal strategies and the potential benefits of simplifying the logic to avoid unnecessary complexity."
