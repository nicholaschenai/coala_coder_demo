He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.\nChef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.\nThere are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.\nNow, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains one integer N.\nNext line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri \u2014 the person whom the ith member reports to.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a list of space-separated integers in ascending order \u2014 the indices of potential killers.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 105\n- 1 \u2264 Ri \u2264 N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.\n- It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask #1 [50 points]: N \u2264 10000\n- Subtask #2 [50 points]: No additional constraints\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n6\n0 1 1 2 2 3\n\nOutput:\n4 5 6\n\n-----Explanation-----\nThe reporting structure:\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Each member of the mafia reports to another member, and there is a single Don who reports to no one (indicated by a reporting value of 0). The task is to identify the members of the mafia who are not reported to by anyone else, as these members are considered potential killers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To find the potential killers, we need to determine which members of the mafia do not appear as a reporting target for any other member. We can achieve this by:\n   - Creating a list to track how many members report to each member.\n   - Iterating through the reporting list to populate this tracking list.\n   - Finally, we will collect the indices of members who have a count of zero in the tracking list, as these members are not reported to by anyone.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Initialize a list 'report_count' of size N+1 with all zeros\n   For each member i from 1 to N:\n       If Ri is not 0:\n           Increment report_count[Ri] by 1\n   Initialize an empty list 'potential_killers'\n   For each member i from 1 to N:\n       If report_count[i] is 0:\n           Append i to potential_killers\n   Sort potential_killers\n   Print the elements of potential_killers as space-separated integers\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef find_potential_killers():\n    # Read the number of members\n    N = int(input())\n    # Read the reporting structure\n    R = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    # Initialize a list to count how many people report to each member\n    report_count = [0] * (N + 1)\n    \n    # Count the number of reports for each member\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        Ri = R[i - 1]  # R is 0-indexed, members are 1-indexed\n        if Ri != 0:\n            report_count[Ri] += 1\n    \n    # Find all members who are not reported to by anyone\n    potential_killers = []\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        if report_count[i] == 0:\n            potential_killers.append(i)\n    \n    # Sort the potential killers\n    potential_killers.sort()\n    \n    # Print the result as space-separated integers\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, potential_killers)))\n\n```"

Each member of the mafia reports to another member, and we need to find members who nobody reports to, which are the \"minor criminals.\" The Don, who reports to no one, is represented by a reporting value of 0.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   - We will read the number of members (N) and their reporting structure (a list of integers where each integer indicates who a member reports to).\n   - We will create a set of all members and a set of members who are reported to.\n   - The potential killers are those members who are not in the set of reported members.\n   - Finally, we will sort the list of potential killers and print them.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_potential_killers(N, reports):\n       all_members = set(range(1, N + 1))  // Create a set of all members\n       reported_members = set()  // Create a set to track reported members\n       \n       for report in reports:\n           if report != 0:  // Ignore the Don\n               reported_members.add(report)  // Add reported members to the set\n       \n       potential_killers = all_members - reported_members  // Find members not reported to\n       return sorted(potential_killers)  // Return sorted list of potential killers\n\n   function main():\n       N = read integer  // Read number of members\n       reports = read list of integers  // Read reporting structure\n       result = find_potential_killers(N, reports)  // Find potential killers\n       print result  // Print the result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_potential_killers(N, reports):\n    # Create a set of all members from 1 to N\n    all_members = set(range(1, N + 1))\n    # Create a set to track reported members\n    reported_members = set()\n    \n    # Iterate through the reports to find who is reported to\n    for report in reports:\n        if report != 0:  # Ignore the Don\n            reported_members.add(report)  # Add reported members to the set\n    \n    # Find potential killers who are not reported to\n    potential_killers = all_members - reported_members\n    # Return the sorted list of potential killers\n    return sorted(potential_killers)\n\ndef main():\n    N = int(input())  # Read number of members\n    reports = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read reporting structure\n    result = find_potential_killers(N, reports)  # Find potential killers\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, result)))  # Print the result as space-separated integers\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n```"

        "content": "In this task, the goal was to identify potential killers in a mafia organization based on a reporting structure. The key insight was to recognize that potential killers are members who nobody reports to, which can be determined by comparing the set of all members with the set of members who are reported to.\n\nThe solution involved creating two sets: one for all members and another for those who are reported to. By iterating through the reporting list and populating the reported members set (ignoring the Don), we could easily find the difference between the two sets to identify potential killers. Sorting the result before outputting it ensured the indices were in ascending order.\n\nThe final implementation was straightforward and efficient, leveraging set operations to achieve the desired outcome. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to encapsulate the logic for finding potential killers. This approach worked well without any unexpected errors, and the solution passed all provided test cases. \n\nKey code snippet:\n```python\ndef find_potential_killers(N, reports):\n    all_members = set(range(1, N + 1))\n    reported_members = set()\n    \n    for report in reports:\n        if report != 0:\n            reported_members.add(report)\n    \n    potential_killers = all_members - reported_members\n    return sorted(potential_killers)\n``` \n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of set operations for efficiently handling membership checks and differences, especially in problems involving relationships or hierarchies."

        "content": "The official solution effectively constructs a tree-like structure to represent the reporting relationships among mafia members. It uses a dictionary to map each member to a list of their direct reports. This approach allows for easy identification of members who do not have anyone reporting to them, which are the potential killers.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n1. **Data Structure**: The use of a dictionary (`tree`) to store each member and their direct reports is efficient. It allows for quick lookups and updates as we process the reporting structure.\n2. **Initialization**: The solution initializes each member in the dictionary, ensuring that even members with no reports are accounted for.\n3. **Identification of Potential Killers**: After constructing the reporting structure, the solution iterates through the dictionary to find members with an empty list of reports, indicating that no one reports to them.\n4. **Output Formatting**: The final output is formatted as a space-separated string, which is straightforward and meets the problem's requirements.\n\nIn contrast, my initial approach was also valid but could be seen as less intuitive in terms of directly representing the relationships. While it correctly identified potential killers, the use of sets might have added unnecessary complexity compared to the straightforward dictionary approach used in the official solution. \n\nOverall, the official solution is efficient and clear, leveraging a dictionary to maintain the reporting structure and easily identify members without reports. This experience reinforces the importance of choosing the right data structure for the problem at hand."

It collects all members in a set and tracks those who have been reported to, excluding the Don (represented by 0). After processing the reports, it calculates the difference between all members and the reported members to find those who are not implicated. Finally, it returns a sorted list of these potential killers and prints them as space-separated integers.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios involving hierarchical structures where you need to identify individuals who are not under the authority of others, such as in organizations, teams, or criminal networks. It can be applied in various fields including law enforcement, corporate management, and social network analysis to find outliers or independent entities. Understanding how to identify members who do not report to anyone can help in investigations, resource allocation, and understanding power dynamics within a group."
