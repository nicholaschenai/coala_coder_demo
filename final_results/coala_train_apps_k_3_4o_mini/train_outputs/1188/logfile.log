## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains one integer N.
Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

-----Output-----
Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order â€” the indices of potential killers.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ Ri â‰¤ N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.
- It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.

1. Restate the problem in plain English

3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef is investigating a murder case involving a mafia organization. Each member of the mafia reports to another member, and there is a single Don who reports to no one (indicated by a reporting value of 0). The task is to identify the members of the mafia who are not reported to by anyone else, as these members are considered potential killers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the potential killers, we need to determine which members of the mafia do not appear as a reporting target for any other member. We can achieve this by:
   - Creating a list to track how many members report to each member.
   - Iterating through the reporting list to populate this tracking list.
   - Finally, we will collect the indices of members who have a count of zero in the tracking list, as these members are not reported to by anyone.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize a list 'report_count' of size N+1 with all zeros
   For each member i from 1 to N:
       If Ri is not 0:
           Increment report_count[Ri] by 1
   Initialize an empty list 'potential_killers'
   For each member i from 1 to N:
       If report_count[i] is 0:
           Append i to potential_killers
   Sort potential_killers
   Print the elements of potential_killers as space-separated integers
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def find_potential_killers():
    # Read the number of members
    N = int(input())
    # Read the reporting structure
    R = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize a list to count how many people report to each member
    report_count = [0] * (N + 1)
    
    # Count the number of reports for each member
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        Ri = R[i - 1]  # R is 0-indexed, members are 1-indexed
        if Ri != 0:
            report_count[Ri] += 1
    
    # Find all members who are not reported to by anyone
    potential_killers = []
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if report_count[i] == 0:
            potential_killers.append(i)
    
    # Sort the potential killers
    potential_killers.sort()
    
    # Print the result as space-separated integers

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
           The problem requires us to determine how many times first, second, and third-year students will all be present on campus together over a given number of days. Each group of students arrives at specific intervals (every x, y, and z hours respectively). We need to find the number of days within a specified range where all three groups are present simultaneously.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           - For each test case, read the number of days (N) and the intervals (x, y, z) for the three groups of students.
           - To find the days when all three groups are present, we need to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals (x, y, z). This will give us the frequency at which all three groups will be present together.
           - Count how many multiples of this LCM fit within the range of days (1 to N).

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function gcd(a, b):
               while b != 0:
                   a, b = b, a % b
               return a

           function lcm(a, b):
               return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

           function calculate_lcm(x, y, z):
               return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)

           function count_days(N, x, y, z):
               lcm_value = calculate_lcm(x, y, z)
               return N // lcm_value

               for each test case:

    [Task]:
        You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
        Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

        -----Input-----
        - First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
        - The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
        - The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
        - The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
        - The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

        -----Output-----
        For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
        - $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
        - $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
        - $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
        - $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
        - Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

        -----Sample Input-----
        1
        2
        1 3
        5
        0 0
        2 0
        0 4
        1 1
        1 2

        -----Sample Output-----
        0
        1
        2
        1
        -1

        -----Explanation-----
        The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

        If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

        If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

        If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
           The problem involves determining how many walls Chef needs to break through to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). Each wall is represented by a line segment connecting points (a_i, 0) and (0, a_i). For each query, we need to check Chef's starting position (x_j, y_j) and determine how many walls he must break to reach the origin. If Chef starts on a wall, we return -1.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           - For each test case, read the number of walls and their respective positions.
           - For each query, check if the starting position lies on any wall. If it does, return -1.
           - If not, determine how many walls Chef needs to break through. A wall is considered broken if Chef's starting position is above and to the right of the wall's line segment.
           - The walls can be represented as a list of integers, and for each query, we can count how many of these integers are greater than the maximum of the x and y coordinates of Chef's starting position.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function count_walls(N, walls, queries):

                   if (x_j, y_j) lies on any wall:
                       print -1
                   else:
                       count = 0
                       for each wall a_i in walls:
                           if a_i > max(x_j, y_j):
                               count += 1
                       print count

           function main(T):
               for each test case:
                   read N
                   read walls
                   read Q
                   read queries
                   count_walls(N, walls, queries)

        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
           The task is to find the N'th number in a specific series defined as 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... for multiple test cases. The input consists of a number of test cases, and for each test case, we need to output the corresponding number from the series.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
           The series appears to be generated by a specific mathematical formula. By analyzing the series, we can derive a formula to compute the N'th term directly without generating all previous terms. We will read the number of test cases, then for each test case, compute the N'th term using the derived formula and print the result.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function calculate_nth_number(N):
               return (N * (N + 1) * (N - 1)) // 6  // This is the formula for the N'th term in the series

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains one integer N.
Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

-----Output-----
Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order â€” the indices of potential killers.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ Ri â‰¤ N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.
- It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to identify potential killers in a mafia organization based on a reporting structure. The key insight was to recognize that potential killers are members who nobody reports to, which can be determined by comparing the set of all members with the set of members who are reported to.

The solution involved creating two sets: one for all members and another for those who are reported to. By iterating through the reporting list and populating the reported members set (ignoring the Don), we could easily find the difference between the two sets to identify potential killers. Sorting the result before outputting it ensured the indices were in ascending order.

The final implementation was straightforward and efficient, leveraging set operations to achieve the desired outcome. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to encapsulate the logic for finding potential killers. This approach worked well without any unexpected errors, and the solution passed all provided test cases. 

Key code snippet:
```python
def find_potential_killers(N, reports):
    all_members = set(range(1, N + 1))
    reported_members = set()
    
    for report in reports:
        if report != 0:
            reported_members.add(report)
    
    potential_killers = all_members - reported_members
    return sorted(potential_killers)
``` 

This experience reinforced the importance of set operations for efficiently handling membership checks and differences, especially in problems involving relationships or hierarchies.

There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains one integer N.
Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

-----Output-----
Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order â€” the indices of potential killers.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ Ri â‰¤ N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.
- It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask #1 [50 points]: N â‰¤ 10000
- Subtask #2 [50 points]: No additional constraints

-----Example-----

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem requires us to identify potential killers in a mafia organization based on a reporting structure. Each member of the mafia reports to another member, and we need to find members who nobody reports to, which are the "minor criminals." The Don, who reports to no one, is represented by a reporting value of 0.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - We will read the number of members (N) and their reporting structure (a list of integers where each integer indicates who a member reports to).
   - We will create a set of all members and a set of members who are reported to.
   - The potential killers are those members who are not in the set of reported members.
   - Finally, we will sort the list of potential killers and print them.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_potential_killers(N, reports):
       all_members = set(range(1, N + 1))  // Create a set of all members
       reported_members = set()  // Create a set to track reported members
       
       for report in reports:
           if report != 0:  // Ignore the Don
               reported_members.add(report)  // Add reported members to the set
       
       potential_killers = all_members - reported_members  // Find members not reported to
       return sorted(potential_killers)  // Return sorted list of potential killers

   function main():
       N = read integer  // Read number of members
       reports = read list of integers  // Read reporting structure
       result = find_potential_killers(N, reports)  // Find potential killers
       print result  // Print the result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def find_potential_killers(N, reports):
    # Create a set of all members from 1 to N
    all_members = set(range(1, N + 1))
    # Create a set to track reported members
    reported_members = set()
    
    # Iterate through the reports to find who is reported to
    for report in reports:
        if report != 0:  # Ignore the Don
            reported_members.add(report)  # Add reported members to the set
    
    # Find potential killers who are not reported to
    potential_killers = all_members - reported_members
    # Return the sorted list of potential killers
    return sorted(potential_killers)

def main():
    N = int(input())  # Read number of members
    reports = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read reporting structure
    result = find_potential_killers(N, reports)  # Find potential killers

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
n = eval(input())
r = list(map(int, input().split()))

tree = dict()
i = 1
for j in r:
 c = tree.get(j)
 if c:
  tree[j].append(i)
 else:
  tree[j] = [i]
 if not tree.get(i):
  tree[i] = []
 i += 1
s = []
for elem in tree:
 if not tree[elem]:
  s.append(str(elem))
print(' '.join(s))

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] The official solution effectively constructs a tree-like structure to represent the reporting relationships among mafia members. It uses a dictionary to map each member to a list of their direct reports. This approach allows for easy identification of members who do not have anyone reporting to them, which are the potential killers.

Key insights from the official solution:
1. **Data Structure**: The use of a dictionary (`tree`) to store each member and their direct reports is efficient. It allows for quick lookups and updates as we process the reporting structure.
2. **Initialization**: The solution initializes each member in the dictionary, ensuring that even members with no reports are accounted for.
3. **Identification of Potential Killers**: After constructing the reporting structure, the solution iterates through the dictionary to find members with an empty list of reports, indicating that no one reports to them.
4. **Output Formatting**: The final output is formatted as a space-separated string, which is straightforward and meets the problem's requirements.

In contrast, my initial approach was also valid but could be seen as less intuitive in terms of directly representing the relationships. While it correctly identified potential killers, the use of sets might have added unnecessary complexity compared to the straightforward dictionary approach used in the official solution. 

Overall, the official solution is efficient and clear, leveraging a dictionary to maintain the reporting structure and easily identify members without reports. This experience reinforces the importance of choosing the right data structure for the problem at hand.
