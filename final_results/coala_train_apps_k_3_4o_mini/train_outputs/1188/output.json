    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The problem requires us to identify potential killers in a mafia organization based on a reporting structure. Each member of the mafia reports to another member, and we need to find members who nobody reports to, which are the \"minor criminals.\" The Don, who reports to no one, is represented by a reporting value of 0.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   - We will read the number of members (N) and their reporting structure (a list of integers where each integer indicates who a member reports to).\n   - We will create a set of all members and a set of members who are reported to.\n   - The potential killers are those members who are not in the set of reported members.\n   - Finally, we will sort the list of potential killers and print them.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_potential_killers(N, reports):\n       all_members = set(range(1, N + 1))  // Create a set of all members\n       reported_members = set()  // Create a set to track reported members\n       \n       for report in reports:\n           if report != 0:  // Ignore the Don\n               reported_members.add(report)  // Add reported members to the set\n       \n       potential_killers = all_members - reported_members  // Find members not reported to\n       return sorted(potential_killers)  // Return sorted list of potential killers\n\n   function main():\n       N = read integer  // Read number of members\n       reports = read list of integers  // Read reporting structure\n       result = find_potential_killers(N, reports)  // Find potential killers\n       print result  // Print the result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_potential_killers(N, reports):\n    # Create a set of all members from 1 to N\n    all_members = set(range(1, N + 1))\n    # Create a set to track reported members\n    reported_members = set()\n    \n    # Iterate through the reports to find who is reported to\n    for report in reports:\n        if report != 0:  # Ignore the Don\n            reported_members.add(report)  # Add reported members to the set\n    \n    # Find potential killers who are not reported to\n    potential_killers = all_members - reported_members\n    # Return the sorted list of potential killers\n    return sorted(potential_killers)\n\ndef main():\n    N = int(input())  # Read number of members\n    reports = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read reporting structure\n    result = find_potential_killers(N, reports)  # Find potential killers\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, result)))  # Print the result as space-separated integers\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n```",
