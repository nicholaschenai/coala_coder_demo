    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The problem involves a tennis tournament where each player competes against every other player exactly once, and there are no ties. The goal is to determine if it's possible for all players to win the same number of matches. If it is possible, we need to provide a specific output format that indicates the results of each match.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we need to recognize that if there are an even number of players (N), it is impossible for each player to win the same number of matches because each player would have to win and lose an equal number of matches, which is not feasible. However, if N is odd, we can create a round-robin style tournament where each player wins exactly one match against one player and loses against another, ensuring that the wins and losses are evenly distributed. The output should be a matrix where the entry at row i and column j indicates whether player i wins against player j.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function solve_tournament(T):\n       for each testcase in T:\n           read N\n           if N is even:\n               print \"NO\"\n           else:\n               print \"YES\"\n               initialize a matrix of size N x N with all zeros\n               for i from 0 to N-1:\n                   for j from 0 to N-1:\n                       if i != j:\n                           if (i + 1) % N == j:\n                               matrix[i][j] = 1  // i wins against j\n               print the matrix\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef solve_tournament(T):\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        if N % 2 == 0:  # Check if N is even\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            # Initialize a matrix of size N x N with all zeros\n            matrix = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]\n            for i in range(N):\n                for j in range(N):\n                    if i != j:\n                        # Player i wins against player (i + 1) % N\n                        if (i + 1) % N == j:\n                            matrix[i][j] = '1'  # i wins against j\n            # Print the matrix\n            for row in matrix:\n                print(''.join(row))\n\nT = int(input())\nsolve_tournament(T)\n```",
