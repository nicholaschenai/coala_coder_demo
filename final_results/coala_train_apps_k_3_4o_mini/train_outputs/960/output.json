    "raw_msg": "Based on the insights and memories provided, it seems that the task is to generate a specific pattern of binary numbers based on the integer input \\( K \\) for multiple test cases. The expected output for each test case consists of \\( K \\) lines, where each line \\( i \\) contains the binary representations of numbers from \\( 1 \\) to \\( i+1 \\).\n\n### Key Points to Address:\n1. For each test case with input \\( K \\):\n   - We need to print \\( K \\) lines.\n   - Each line \\( i \\) should consist of the binary representations of numbers from \\( 1 \\) to \\( i+1 \\).\n   - The output for each test case should be printed consecutively without any extra blank lines in between.\n\n### Final Python Code\nHere is the corrected code that implements the above logic:\n\n```python\ndef print_pattern(T):\n    # Loop through each test case\n    for t in range(T):\n        K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case\n        # Loop to generate each line of the pattern\n        for i in range(K):\n            line = []  # Initialize an empty list to hold the current line's binary numbers\n            # Append binary representations from 1 to i+1\n            for j in range(1, i + 2):\n                line.append(bin(j)[2:])  # Convert j to binary and remove the '0b' prefix\n            # Print the current line as a string\n            print(' '.join(line))\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nprint_pattern(T)  # Call the function to print the patterns for all test cases\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- The function `print_pattern` takes the number of test cases \\( T \\) as input.\n- For each test case, it reads the integer \\( K \\).\n- It generates \\( K \\) lines, where each line \\( i \\) consists of:\n  - Binary representations of numbers from \\( 1 \\) to \\( i+1 \\).\n- Each line is printed as a single string.\n- There are no extra blank lines between the lines of the same test case.\n\nThis code should now correctly generate the desired output format for each test case as specified in the problem statement.",
