    "raw_msg": "Based on the insights and memories provided, it seems that the task is to generate a specific pattern based on the integer input \\( K \\) for multiple test cases. The expected output for each test case consists of \\( K \\) lines, where each line \\( i \\) contains numbers starting from \\( 0 \\) up to \\( i \\) and then back down to \\( 0 \\).\n\n### Key Points to Address:\n1. Each line \\( i \\) should consist of numbers from \\( 0 \\) to \\( i \\) and then back down to \\( 0 \\).\n2. The output for each test case should be separated by a blank line, except for the last test case.\n\n### Revised Code\nHere is the corrected Python code that implements the required logic:\n\n```python\ndef print_pattern(T):\n    # Loop through each test case\n    for t in range(T):\n        K = int(input())  # Read the integer K for the current test case\n        # Loop to generate each line of the pattern\n        for i in range(K):\n            line = []  # Initialize an empty list to hold the current line's numbers\n            # Append numbers from 0 to i\n            for j in range(i + 1):\n                line.append(str(j))\n            # Append numbers from i-1 down to 0\n            for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):\n                line.append(str(j))\n            # Print the current line as a string\n            print(''.join(line))\n        # Print a blank line after each test case except the last one\n        if t < T - 1:\n            print()\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nprint_pattern(T)  # Call the function to print the patterns for all test cases\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- The function `print_pattern` takes the number of test cases \\( T \\) as input.\n- For each test case, it reads the integer \\( K \\).\n- It generates \\( K \\) lines, where each line \\( i \\) consists of:\n  - Numbers from \\( 0 \\) to \\( i \\).\n  - Followed by numbers from \\( i-1 \\) down to \\( 0 \\).\n- Each line is printed as a single string.\n- A blank line is printed between test cases, except after the last test case.\n\nThis code should now correctly generate the desired output format for each test case.",
