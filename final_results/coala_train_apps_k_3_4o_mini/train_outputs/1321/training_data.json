    "summary": "In this task, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... for multiple test cases. Initially, I attempted to derive a formula for the series but mistakenly used an incorrect formula that did not correspond to the series, leading to incorrect outputs.\n\nUpon analyzing the series, I identified that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, which led to the realization that the N'th term could be computed as the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares. The correct formula for the N'th term is:\n- T(N) = (N-1) * N * (2(N-1) + 1) / 6\n\nThis formula was derived from the known formula for the sum of squares. After implementing this corrected formula, the code produced the expected results for all test cases.\n\nThe final working code is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_nth_number(N):\n    if N == 1:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return (N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1) // 6\n\ndef main():\n    T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N\n        result = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n        print(result)  # Output the result\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring that the derived formulas are correct before implementation.",
    "reflection": "In reflecting on my attempts to solve the problem, I learned several key insights about deriving formulas for series and the importance of correctly interpreting the problem statement.\n\nInitially, I misidentified the formula for the series, leading to incorrect outputs. The series is defined by the sum of squares, and I initially used a formula that did not correspond to the series' actual behavior. The official solution correctly identifies that for N=1, the output is 0, and for other values, it uses a derived formula based on the sum of squares, specifically:\n\n- For N > 1, the formula used is: \n  \\[\n  T(N) = \\frac{(N-2 + 1)(2(N-2) + 3)(N-2 + 2)}{6}\n  \\]\n  This effectively calculates the N'th term by adjusting the index and applying the sum of squares formula.\n\nThe official solution also highlights the importance of handling edge cases, such as when N=1, which I initially included but did not implement correctly in my formula. \n\nOverall, the experience reinforced the need to carefully analyze the series and derive the correct mathematical representation before implementing it in code. The official solution's approach is efficient and concise, demonstrating a clear understanding of the mathematical principles involved.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThe function reads an integer input representing the number of test cases and then iterates through each test case to read an integer value. For each value, it calculates the N'th number in a specific series using a predefined formula. The result of the calculation is then printed to the console. This process continues for all test cases provided by the user. The function effectively handles multiple inputs and outputs the corresponding results in sequence. Overall, it serves as the entry point for executing the program's logic.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to compute specific terms in a mathematical series efficiently, especially when dealing with multiple test cases. It can be applied in competitive programming, algorithm design, or any situation where series calculations are required, such as in simulations or mathematical modeling. Understanding how to derive terms from a series can also aid in optimizing performance when the number of queries is large, as seen in the constraints of this problem."
