The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximums of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a descending permutation is \\( N \\times (N - 1) \\). This insight was crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a given \\( K \\).\n\n    Initially, my approach to calculating the maximum value and adjusting the permutation was flawed. I incorrectly calculated the maximum possible value and did not implement a clear strategy for adjusting the permutation to reach \\( K \\). The adjustment logic involved swapping adjacent elements, but it lacked a systematic approach to ensure that the desired \\( K \\) could be achieved.\n\n    After revising the code, I implemented a more structured approach: I calculated the maximum value correctly, checked if \\( K \\) was feasible, and then constructed a descending permutation. I iteratively adjusted the permutation by swapping elements while recalculating \\( f(P) \\) until it matched \\( K \\) or determined it was impossible.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, input().split())\n            max_value = N * (N - 1)\n        \n            if K > max_value:\n                print(-1)\n                continue\n        \n            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n            current_f = sum(max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1]) for i in range(N - 1))\n        \n            for i in range(N - 1):\n                if current_f > K:\n                    if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:\n                        permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                        current_f = sum(max(permutation[j], permutation[j + 1]) for j in range(N - 1))\n            \n                if current_f == K:\n                    break\n        \n            if current_f == K:\n                print(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n            else:\n                print(-1)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    find_permutation(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of clearly understanding the problem constraints and systematically approaching adjustments in permutations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to calculate the maximum strength of an army formed by Pok\u00e9mon strengths using an alternating sum formula. The alternating sum is defined as \\( a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \\ldots \\). The challenge was to maximize this sum based on the original arrangement of strengths without any swap operations.\n\n    Initially, I misunderstood the requirement and attempted to calculate the alternating sum based on the sorted strengths rather than the original order. This led to incorrect outputs, as the alternating sum should reflect the optimal selection of strengths from the original list. The correct approach involved sorting the strengths in descending order and then applying the alternating sum formula based on the sorted list.\n\n    The final solution correctly implemented this logic by sorting the strengths and calculating the maximum alternating sum by adding strengths at even indices and subtracting those at odd indices. However, despite these corrections, the solution still failed to produce the expected results, indicating a deeper misunderstanding of how to select strengths optimally.\n\n    Key Takeaways:\n    - The alternating sum needs to be calculated based on the optimal selection of strengths, not just their positions.\n    - Sorting the strengths in descending order is essential for maximizing the alternating sum.\n    - Careful attention to the problem requirements is crucial to avoid logical errors in implementation.\n\n    Final Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def calculate_max_strength(t):\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n, q = map(int, input().split())\n            strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            strengths.sort(reverse=True)\n            max_strength = 0\n            for index in range(n):\n                if index % 2 == 0:\n                    max_strength += strengths[index]\n                else:\n                    max_strength -= strengths[index]\n            print(max_strength)\n\n    t = int(input())\n    calculate_max_strength(t)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and the need for careful implementation to achieve the desired results.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to calculate the mean of maximum scores for students after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve, which are assigned to specific ranges of students based on their roll numbers.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the efficient updating of scores for a range of students based on multiple queries. The approach involved initializing a list of scores, iterating through each question, and updating the scores for the specified range. The final mean score was calculated by summing the scores and dividing by the number of students, using integer division to obtain the floor value.\n\n    The solution was implemented successfully without any errors, and the provided code snippet effectively handled the input and output requirements. The key takeaway was the importance of managing score updates efficiently, especially given the constraints where both the number of students and questions could be large (up to 100,000). The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_mean_scores(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, M = map(int, input().split())\n            scores = [10] * N\n            for _ in range(M):\n                i, j, k = map(int, input().split())\n                for student in range(i - 1, j):\n                    scores[student] *= k\n            total_score = sum(scores)\n            mean_score = total_score // N\n            print(mean_score)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    calculate_mean_scores(T)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements and efficiently managing data updates in programming challenges.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Arrays**: The solution uses four arrays (`fn`, `sn`, `tn`, `fon`) to keep track of maximum values at different stages of the computation:\n   - `fn[i]`: Maximum value of `A[d]` for indices `d` greater than `i`.\n   - `sn[i]`: Maximum value of `A[b] - A[c]` for indices `c` greater than `b` and `b` greater than `a`.\n   - `tn[i]`: Maximum value of `A[b] - A[c] + A[d]` for indices `d` greater than `c`.\n   - `fon[i]`: Maximum value of the entire expression for indices `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.\n\n2. **Reverse Iteration**: The solution iterates through the array in reverse order.
