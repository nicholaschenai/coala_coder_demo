    "summary": "In this task, the goal was to determine which citizens are beheaded based on their wealth declarations and the king's visits. The core concept involved efficiently tracking the wealth of citizens and identifying the richest one during each visit. The solution utilized a list to store the wealth of citizens and employed the `max()` function to find the richest citizen quickly.\n\nThe approach worked well, as it allowed for straightforward wealth declarations and efficient retrieval of the maximum wealth during the king's visits. The main operations included appending wealth to a list and removing the richest citizen after each visit, which was manageable within the problem's constraints.\n\nOne potential area for optimization could be the removal of the richest citizen from the list, as this operation can be costly in terms of time complexity. However, given the constraints provided, the solution performed adequately. The final implementation successfully passed all tests, confirming its correctness and efficiency. \n\nThe final code snippet is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef find_beheaded_citizens():\n    citizens = []\n    results = []\n    N, M = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    for _ in range(N + M):\n        line = int(input())\n        if line > 0:\n            citizens.append(line)\n        elif line == -1:\n            richest = max(citizens)\n            results.append(richest)\n            citizens.remove(richest)\n\n    for wealth in results:\n        print(wealth)\n\nfind_beheaded_citizens()\n``` \n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of efficiently managing data structures to handle dynamic inputs and outputs, especially in scenarios involving frequent updates and queries.",
    "reflection": "The official solution takes a different approach to track the wealth of citizens and identify the richest one during the king's visits. Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Data Structure**: The official solution uses a list `l` to store the wealth of citizens. It maintains a separate variable `leng` to track the number of citizens currently in the list, which helps avoid unnecessary iterations over the entire list.\n\n2. **Finding the Richest Citizen**: Instead of using the `max()` function, which scans the entire list, the official solution iterates through the list manually during each king's visit. It keeps track of the maximum wealth found (`cm`) and its index (`mi`). This approach can be more efficient in terms of memory usage since it avoids creating a new list or removing elements from the list.\n\n3. **Marking Citizens as Dead**: When a citizen is beheaded, the official solution marks them as dead by setting their wealth to `-1`. This avoids the need to remove elements from the list, which can be costly in terms of performance.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. By avoiding the use of `remove()` and instead marking citizens as dead, it reduces the overhead associated with list operations.\n\nOverall, the official solution is effective in handling the problem requirements while maintaining efficiency. In future implementations, I should consider using similar strategies for managing state (like marking instead of removing) and optimizing searches through manual iteration when necessary.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: find_beheaded_citizens]\nThis function processes input to track the wealth of citizens and simulates a scenario where a king visits and beheads the richest citizen. It initializes two lists: one for storing the wealth of citizens and another for recording the wealth of beheaded citizens. The function reads a specified number of inputs, distinguishing between positive integers representing citizen wealth and a sentinel value indicating a king's visit. Upon a visit, it identifies and removes the wealthiest citizen from the list, adding their wealth to the results. Finally, it outputs the wealth of each citizen that was beheaded during the visits. The function effectively manages the wealth data and simulates the consequences of the king's actions.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge would be useful in scenarios where a decision-making process needs to prioritize certain individuals based on a specific criterion, such as wealth or performance. It can apply to resource allocation, competitive environments, or any situation where a group is evaluated and the top performer is selected for a specific action. Additionally, it can be relevant in programming contests or algorithm design where efficient data handling and retrieval of maximum values are required, especially under constraints of time and space complexity."
