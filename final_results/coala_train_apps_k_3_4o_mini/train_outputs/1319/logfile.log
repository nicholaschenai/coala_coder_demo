## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A despotic king decided that his kingdom needed to be rid of corruption and disparity. He called his prime minister and ordered that all corrupt citizens be put to death. Moreover, he wanted this done quickly.
The wily prime minister realised that investigating every citizen to decide who was corrupt and who was not was rather difficult. So he decided on the following plan: He ordered all the citizens to appear in the court one by one and declare their wealth.
The king does not sit in the court all the time (he has other important business to attend to - for instance, meet dignitaries from neighbouring kingdoms, spend time with his family â€¦) Whenever the king walks into the court, the prime minister pulls out the richest man who has appeared before the court so far and is still alive and beheads him for being corrupt. Since the rich are more likely to be corrupt, he hopes to get rid of most of the corrupt and the king is happy as he sees his policy being implemented enthusiastically.
Suppose the wealth of the citizens trooping into the court is
1376518911241376518911241\; 3\; 7\; 6\; 5\; 18\;  9\; 11\;  2\; 4
and the king walked in three times: the first time after the first four persons have seen the minister, the second time after the first five persons have seen the minister and, finally after the first nine persons have seen the minister.
At the king's first visit the richest person to have met the minister has wealth $7$ and he would be beheaded. At the second visit, the wealth of the richest person who has met the minister and is still alive has wealth $6$ and so he would be beheaded. At the third visit the richest person to have met the minister who is still alive has wealth $18$ and so he would be beheaded.
You may assume that the input is such that whenever the king walks in, it is always possible to behead someone.
Your aim is to write a program that will enable the prime minister to identify the richest man to have met the minister and who is still alive quickly. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input consists of two numbers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of citizens in the kingdom and M is the number of visits to the court by the king.
The next $N+M$ lines describe the order in which the $N$ citizens' appearances are interleaved with the $M$ visits by the king. A citizen's visit is denoted by a positive integer, signifying his wealth. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth. A visit by the king is denoted by $-1$.

-----Output:-----
Your output should consist of $M$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at the $i^{th}$ visit of the king.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq M \leq 10000$.
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- You may assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs $1 \leq M \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq N \leq 8000$.

INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The king wants to eliminate corrupt citizens based on their wealth. Citizens declare their wealth one by one, and whenever the king visits, the prime minister must identify and behead the richest citizen who has declared their wealth up to that point and is still alive. The input consists of a sequence of wealth declarations and king's visits, and the output should be the wealth of the citizens beheaded during each of the king's visits.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   We need to keep track of the wealth of citizens as they declare it. When the king visits, we need to quickly find the richest citizen who has declared their wealth and has not been beheaded yet. To do this efficiently, we can use a max-heap (or a priority queue) to keep track of the wealth of citizens. Each time a citizen declares their wealth, we add it to the heap. When the king visits, we pop the maximum wealth from the heap, which represents the richest citizen to be beheaded. We also need to ensure that we only consider citizens who are still alive.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize an empty max-heap
   Initialize an empty list for results

   For each input line:
       If the line is a positive integer (wealth):
           Push the wealth into the max-heap
       Else if the line is -1 (king's visit):
           Pop the maximum wealth from the max-heap
           Append this wealth to the results list

   Print each wealth in the results list
   ```

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money (K) to N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money, such that he ends up with exactly zero. The key insights were that if the total demand from all minions exceeds K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and if the total demand equals K, he can distribute the money exactly.

    Initially, I implemented a solution that simply checked if the total demand was greater than, equal to, or less than K. However, this approach failed to account for the scenario where the total demand was less than K but could still be distributed in a way that Gru ends up with zero. The logic needed to ensure that Gru could fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.

    The correct approach involves:
    1. Calculating the total demand.
    2. Checking if the total demand exceeds K (output "NO").
    3. If the total demand equals K, output "YES".
    4. If the total demand is less than K, output "NO" since Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.

    The final code snippet that captures this logic is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, input().split())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
            total_demand = sum(A)
        
            if total_demand > K:
                print("NO")
            elif total_demand == K:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    can_distribute_money(T)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the conditions under which money can be distributed and ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly.

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to determine the winner of a billiards game based on scores from multiple rounds. The key concept was to track cumulative scores for two players and identify the maximum lead at any point during the game. The solution involved reading input scores, updating cumulative totals, calculating leads, and determining the player with the highest lead.

    The approach I took was straightforward: I initialized cumulative scores and iterated through each round to update these scores. After calculating the lead for each round, I compared it with the maximum lead recorded so far and updated the winner accordingly. This method effectively captured the necessary logic to solve the problem.

    The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test case. The code snippet used is as follows:

    ```python
    def find_winner():
        N = int(input())
        cumulative_score_player1 = 0
        cumulative_score_player2 = 0
        max_lead = 0
        winner = 0

        for _ in range(N):
            scores = list(map(int, input().split()))
            score_player1 = scores[0]
            score_player2 = scores[1]
        
            cumulative_score_player1 += score_player1
            cumulative_score_player2 += score_player2
        
            if cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:
                lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2
                current_winner = 1
            else:
                lead = cumulative_score_player2 - cumulative_score_player1
                current_winner = 2
        
            if lead > max_lead:
                max_lead = lead
                winner = current_winner

        print(winner, max_lead)

    find_winner()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of maintaining state (cumulative scores) and tracking changes (leads) throughout iterative processes, which is a common pattern in competitive programming problems.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main challenge was to efficiently handle two types of operations on a list of hill heights: determining the final position after a series of jumps and updating the heights of a specified range. The core concept involved simulating the jumps based on the heights of the hills and ensuring that the jumps adhered to the constraints provided (i.e., jumping only to the nearest taller hill and not exceeding a distance of 100).

    The solution involved iterating through the hills for each jump operation, which worked well within the constraints. The height update operation was straightforward, directly modifying the heights in the specified range. The implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic for both operations was clearly defined.

    One key takeaway was the importance of efficiently checking conditions during the jump operation to avoid unnecessary iterations, especially given the potential size of the input (up to 100,000 hills and operations). The final implementation was effective, and the tests passed without any issues, indicating that the approach was sound. 

    The code snippet for the solution is as follows:

    ```python
    def find_final_hill(N, heights, operations):
        for operation in operations:
            if operation[0] == 1:  # Type 1 operation
                i = operation[1]
                k = operation[2]
                current_hill = i
                for jump in range(k):
                    next_hill = current_hill + 1
                    while next_hill <= N and (heights[next_hill - 1] <= heights[current_hill - 1] or next_hill - current_hill > 100):
                        next_hill += 1
                    if next_hill > N:
                        break
                    current_hill = next_hill
                print(current_hill)
            elif operation[0] == 2:  # Type 2 operation
                L = operation[1]
                R = operation[2]
                X = operation[3]
                for j in range(L - 1, R):
                    heights[j] += X

    # Read input
    N, Q = map(int, input().split())
    heights = list(map(int, input().split()))
    operations = []
    for _ in range(Q):
        operations.append(list(map(int, input().split())))

[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves a king who wants to eliminate corrupt citizens based on their wealth. Citizens declare their wealth in a court, and whenever the king visits, the prime minister must identify and behead the richest citizen who has appeared so far. The task is to determine which citizens are beheaded during the king's visits based on the order of wealth declarations and visits.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   We need to keep track of the wealth of citizens as they declare it. When the king visits, we should be able to quickly find the richest citizen who has declared their wealth and is still alive. To do this efficiently, we can use a list to store the wealth of citizens and a variable to keep track of the richest citizen. Each time the king visits, we will find the maximum wealth from the list of declared citizens, mark that citizen as dead (remove them from consideration), and output their wealth.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Initialize an empty list to store the wealth of citizens
   Initialize an empty list to store the results of beheaded citizens

   For each input line:
       If the line is a positive integer (wealth):
           Append the wealth to the citizens' list
       If the line is -1 (king's visit):
           Find the maximum wealth in the citizens' list
           Append this wealth to the results list
           Remove this wealth from the citizens' list (mark as dead)

   Print each wealth from the results list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def find_beheaded_citizens():
    # Initialize a list to store the wealth of citizens
    citizens = []
    # Initialize a list to store the results of beheaded citizens

    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Process each input line
    for _ in range(N + M):
        line = int(input())
        if line > 0:  # If it's a citizen's wealth
            citizens.append(line)
        elif line == -1:  # If it's a king's visit
            # Find the richest citizen who is still alive

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves a king who wants to eliminate corrupt citizens based on their wealth. Citizens declare their wealth in a court, and whenever the king visits, the prime minister must identify and behead the richest citizen who has appeared so far. The task is to determine which citizens are beheaded during the king's visits based on the order of wealth declarations and visits.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   We need to keep track of the wealth of citizens as they declare it. When the king visits, we should be able to quickly find the richest citizen who has declared their wealth and is still alive. To do this efficiently, we can use a list to store the wealth of citizens and a variable to keep track of the richest citizen. Each time the king visits, we will find the maximum wealth from the list of declared citizens, mark that citizen as dead (remove them from consideration), and output their wealth.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Initialize an empty list to store the wealth of citizens
   Initialize an empty list to store the results of beheaded citizens

   For each input line:
       If the line is a positive integer (wealth):
           Append the wealth to the citizens' list

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A despotic king decided that his kingdom needed to be rid of corruption and disparity. He called his prime minister and ordered that all corrupt citizens be put to death. Moreover, he wanted this done quickly.
The wily prime minister realised that investigating every citizen to decide who was corrupt and who was not was rather difficult. So he decided on the following plan: He ordered all the citizens to appear in the court one by one and declare their wealth.
The king does not sit in the court all the time (he has other important business to attend to - for instance, meet dignitaries from neighbouring kingdoms, spend time with his family â€¦) Whenever the king walks into the court, the prime minister pulls out the richest man who has appeared before the court so far and is still alive and beheads him for being corrupt. Since the rich are more likely to be corrupt, he hopes to get rid of most of the corrupt and the king is happy as he sees his policy being implemented enthusiastically.
Suppose the wealth of the citizens trooping into the court is
1376518911241376518911241\; 3\; 7\; 6\; 5\; 18\;  9\; 11\;  2\; 4
and the king walked in three times: the first time after the first four persons have seen the minister, the second time after the first five persons have seen the minister and, finally after the first nine persons have seen the minister.
At the king's first visit the richest person to have met the minister has wealth $7$ and he would be beheaded. At the second visit, the wealth of the richest person who has met the minister and is still alive has wealth $6$ and so he would be beheaded. At the third visit the richest person to have met the minister who is still alive has wealth $18$ and so he would be beheaded.
You may assume that the input is such that whenever the king walks in, it is always possible to behead someone.
Your aim is to write a program that will enable the prime minister to identify the richest man to have met the minister and who is still alive quickly. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input consists of two numbers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of citizens in the kingdom and M is the number of visits to the court by the king.
The next $N+M$ lines describe the order in which the $N$ citizens' appearances are interleaved with the $M$ visits by the king. A citizen's visit is denoted by a positive integer, signifying his wealth. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth. A visit by the king is denoted by $-1$.

-----Output:-----
Your output should consist of $M$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at the $i^{th}$ visit of the king.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq M \leq 10000$.
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- You may assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs $1 \leq M \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq N \leq 8000$.

INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine which citizens are beheaded based on their wealth declarations and the king's visits. The core concept involved efficiently tracking the wealth of citizens and identifying the richest one during each visit. The solution utilized a list to store the wealth of citizens and employed the `max()` function to find the richest citizen quickly.

The approach worked well, as it allowed for straightforward wealth declarations and efficient retrieval of the maximum wealth during the king's visits. The main operations included appending wealth to a list and removing the richest citizen after each visit, which was manageable within the problem's constraints.

One potential area for optimization could be the removal of the richest citizen from the list, as this operation can be costly in terms of time complexity. However, given the constraints provided, the solution performed adequately. The final implementation successfully passed all tests, confirming its correctness and efficiency. 

The final code snippet is as follows:

```python
def find_beheaded_citizens():
    citizens = []
    results = []
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    
    for _ in range(N + M):
        line = int(input())
        if line > 0:
            citizens.append(line)
        elif line == -1:
            richest = max(citizens)
            results.append(richest)
            citizens.remove(richest)

    for wealth in results:
        print(wealth)

find_beheaded_citizens()
``` 

This experience reinforced the importance of efficiently managing data structures to handle dynamic inputs and outputs, especially in scenarios involving frequent updates and queries.

        leng+=1

INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] The official solution takes a different approach to track the wealth of citizens and identify the richest one during the king's visits. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Data Structure**: The official solution uses a list `l` to store the wealth of citizens. It maintains a separate variable `leng` to track the number of citizens currently in the list, which helps avoid unnecessary iterations over the entire list.

2. **Finding the Richest Citizen**: Instead of using the `max()` function, which scans the entire list, the official solution iterates through the list manually during each king's visit. It keeps track of the maximum wealth found (`cm`) and its index (`mi`). This approach can be more efficient in terms of memory usage since it avoids creating a new list or removing elements from the list.

3. **Marking Citizens as Dead**: When a citizen is beheaded, the official solution marks them as dead by setting their wealth to `-1`. This avoids the need to remove elements from the list, which can be costly in terms of performance.

4. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. By avoiding the use of `remove()` and instead marking citizens as dead, it reduces the overhead associated with list operations.

Overall, the official solution is effective in handling the problem requirements while maintaining efficiency. In future implementations, I should consider using similar strategies for managing state (like marking instead of removing) and optimizing searches through manual iteration when necessary.

The main function is `find_beheaded_citizens`.
INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] This function processes input to track the wealth of citizens and simulates a scenario where a king visits and beheads the richest citizen. It initializes two lists: one for storing the wealth of citizens and another for recording the wealth of beheaded citizens. The function reads a specified number of inputs, distinguishing between positive integers representing citizen wealth and a sentinel value indicating a king's visit. Upon a visit, it identifies and removes the wealthiest citizen from the list, adding their wealth to the results. Finally, it outputs the wealth of each citizen that was beheaded during the visits. The function effectively manages the wealth data and simulates the consequences of the king's actions.

[Problem]
    A despotic king decided that his kingdom needed to be rid of corruption and disparity. He called his prime minister and ordered that all corrupt citizens be put to death. Moreover, he wanted this done quickly.
    The wily prime minister realised that investigating every citizen to decide who was corrupt and who was not was rather difficult. So he decided on the following plan: He ordered all the citizens to appear in the court one by one and declare their wealth.
    The king does not sit in the court all the time (he has other important business to attend to - for instance, meet dignitaries from neighbouring kingdoms, spend time with his family â€¦) Whenever the king walks into the court, the prime minister pulls out the richest man who has appeared before the court so far and is still alive and beheads him for being corrupt. Since the rich are more likely to be corrupt, he hopes to get rid of most of the corrupt and the king is happy as he sees his policy being implemented enthusiastically.
    Suppose the wealth of the citizens trooping into the court is
    1376518911241376518911241\; 3\; 7\; 6\; 5\; 18\;  9\; 11\;  2\; 4
    and the king walked in three times: the first time after the first four persons have seen the minister, the second time after the first five persons have seen the minister and, finally after the first nine persons have seen the minister.
    At the king's first visit the richest person to have met the minister has wealth $7$ and he would be beheaded. At the second visit, the wealth of the richest person who has met the minister and is still alive has wealth $6$ and so he would be beheaded. At the third visit the richest person to have met the minister who is still alive has wealth $18$ and so he would be beheaded.
    You may assume that the input is such that whenever the king walks in, it is always possible to behead someone.
    Your aim is to write a program that will enable the prime minister to identify the richest man to have met the minister and who is still alive quickly. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth.

    -----Input:-----
    The first line of the input consists of two numbers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of citizens in the kingdom and M is the number of visits to the court by the king.
    The next $N+M$ lines describe the order in which the $N$ citizens' appearances are interleaved with the $M$ visits by the king. A citizen's visit is denoted by a positive integer, signifying his wealth. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth. A visit by the king is denoted by $-1$.

    -----Output:-----
    Your output should consist of $M$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at the $i^{th}$ visit of the king.

    -----Constraints:-----
    - $1 \leq M \leq 10000$.
    - $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
    - You may assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs $1 \leq M \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq N \leq 8000$.
