    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   Chef wants to create a schedule for his restaurant where he serves one of four Ukrainian dishes each day. The dishes must be different from one day to the next, and the first and last dishes must also be different. Given a number of days, we need to calculate how many valid schedules can be created, and since the result can be large, we will return it modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   - For each day, there are 4 choices of dishes.\n   - The first day can have any of the 4 dishes.\n   - For the second day, there are 3 choices (since it must be different from the first).\n   - For the third day onward, there are 3 choices for each day (since it must be different from the previous day).\n   - However, the last day must also be different from the first day, which adds a constraint.\n   - We can derive a formula based on the number of days:\n     - If \\(N = 2\\): \\(4 \\times 3\\)\n     - If \\(N = 3\\): \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 3\\)\n     - If \\(N \\geq 4\\): \\(4 \\times 3^{(N-2)}\\) (for the first day, then 3 choices for the second and third days, and then 3 choices for the remaining days, ensuring the last day is different from the first).\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function calculate_schedules(N):\n       if N == 2:\n           return (4 * 3) % (10**9 + 7)\n       else:\n           return (4 * (3 ** (N - 1))) % (10**9 + 7)\n\n   function main():\n       read T  // number of test cases\n       for each test case from 1 to T:\n           read N\n           result = calculate_schedules(N)\n           print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef calculate_schedules(N):\n    # Calculate the number of valid schedules based on the number of days N\n    if N == 2:\n        return (4 * 3) % (10**9 + 7)  # For 2 days, 4 choices for the first and 3 for the second\n    else:\n        return (4 * (3 ** (N - 1))) % (10**9 + 7)  # For N >= 3, 4 choices for the first and 3 for the rest\n\ndef main():\n    T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())  # Read the number of days for each test case\n        result = calculate_schedules(N)  # Calculate the number of schedules\n        print(result)  # Output the result\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n```",
