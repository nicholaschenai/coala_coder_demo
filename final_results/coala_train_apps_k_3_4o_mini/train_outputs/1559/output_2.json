    "raw_msg": "Based on the previous analysis and corrections, here is the final corrected Python code to solve the problem of calculating the number of valid schedules for Chef's restaurant. The code has been adjusted to ensure that the last dish is different from the first dish while adhering to the constraints.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_schedules(N):\n    # Calculate the number of valid schedules based on the number of days N\n    if N == 2:\n        return (4 * 3) % (10**9 + 7)  # For 2 days, 4 choices for the first and 3 for the second\n    elif N == 3:\n        return (4 * 3 * 2) % (10**9 + 7)  # For 3 days, 4 choices for the first, 3 for the second, and 2 for the last\n    else:\n        return (4 * 3 * (3 ** (N - 3)) * 2) % (10**9 + 7)  # For N >= 4, 4 choices for the first, 3 for the second, 3 for the next N-2, and 2 for the last\n\ndef main():\n    T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())  # Read the number of days for each test case\n        result = calculate_schedules(N)  # Calculate the number of schedules\n        print(result)  # Output the result\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- **Function `calculate_schedules(N)`**:\n  - For \\(N = 2\\): There are 4 choices for the first day and 3 for the second day, resulting in \\(4 \\times 3\\).\n  - For \\(N = 3\\): There are 4 choices for the first day, 3 for the second, and 2 for the last day, resulting in \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 2\\).\n  - For \\(N \\geq 4\\): The first day has 4 choices, the second day has 3 choices, and for the next \\(N-2\\) days, there are 3 choices each. The last day must be different from the first, giving us 2 choices. Thus, the formula becomes \\(4 \\times 3 \\times (3^{(N-3)}) \\times 2\\).\n\n- **Function `main()`**:\n  - Reads the number of test cases and the number of days for each test case, then calls `calculate_schedules(N)` to compute the result and print it.\n\nThis code should now correctly compute the number of valid schedules for each test case.",
