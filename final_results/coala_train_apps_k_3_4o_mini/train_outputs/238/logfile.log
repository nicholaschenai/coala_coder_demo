## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:


Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

Example 2:


Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.


Example 3:


Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        
```

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 238 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a list of stock prices where each element represents the price of a stock on a specific day. Our goal is to determine the maximum profit we can achieve by making at most two buy-sell transactions. We cannot buy stocks again until we have sold the previous ones.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can break it down into two main parts:
   - First, we will calculate the maximum profit we can achieve with one transaction from the start of the list to each day.
   - Then, we will calculate the maximum profit we can achieve with one transaction from each day to the end of the list.
   - Finally, we will combine these two results to find the maximum profit we can achieve with two transactions by iterating through the days and summing the profits from the two parts.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function maxProfit(prices):
       if prices is empty:
           return 0
       
       n = length of prices
       create an array left_profit of size n
       create an array right_profit of size n
       
       // Calculate maximum profit for one transaction from the left
       min_price = prices[0]
       for i from 0 to n-1:
           min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])
           left_profit[i] = max(left_profit[i-1], prices[i] - min_price)
       
       // Calculate maximum profit for one transaction from the right
       max_price = prices[n-1]
       for i from n-1 down to 0:
           max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])
           right_profit[i] = max(right_profit[i+1], max_price - prices[i])
       
       // Combine the results to find the maximum profit with two transactions
       max_profit = 0
       for i from 0 to n-1:
           max_profit = max(max_profit, left_profit[i] + right_profit[i])
       
       return max_profit
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: list[int]) -> int:
        # Check if the prices list is empty

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy given a list of prices and a budget. The core concept involved sorting the prices to prioritize purchasing the cheapest chocolates first, which is a common greedy algorithm strategy.

    The solution was straightforward: after sorting the prices, I iterated through the list, maintaining a running total of the amount spent and counting the chocolates bought until the budget was exceeded. This approach effectively maximized the number of chocolates purchased.

    The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test case without any issues. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of sorting in optimization problems where resource allocation is constrained, as it allows for a more efficient selection process. The code snippet used is as follows:

    ```python
    def max_chocolates(n, k, prices):
        prices.sort()
        total_spent = 0
        chocolates_bought = 0
    
        for price in prices:
            if total_spent + price <= k:
                total_spent += price
                chocolates_bought += 1
            else:
                break
    
        return chocolates_bought

    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(max_chocolates(n, k, prices))
    ``` 

    This solution effectively addresses the problem and can be referenced for similar future tasks involving budget constraints and optimization.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
           Anushka wants to buy as many chocolates as possible with a limited amount of money. Each chocolate has a specific price, and she needs to figure out how many chocolates she can buy without exceeding her budget.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
           To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
           - First, we will sort the list of chocolate prices in ascending order. This way, we can start buying the cheapest chocolates first, which will allow Anushka to maximize the number of chocolates she can buy.
           - Then, we will iterate through the sorted list of prices, keeping track of the total amount spent and the number of chocolates bought. We will stop when adding another chocolate would exceed her budget.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function max_chocolates(n, k, prices):
               sort prices in ascending order
               total_spent = 0
               chocolates_bought = 0
       
               for price in prices:
                   if total_spent + price <= k:
                       total_spent += price
                       chocolates_bought += 1
                   else:
                       break
       
               return chocolates_bought

           read n and k

[Summary]:
    The problem involves maximizing the sum of pizza slice sizes taken from a circular array, where the picking order is constrained by the actions of two friends. The key concepts tested here include dynamic programming and handling circular arrays, which require careful consideration of the start and end indices when making selections.

    The solution was structured around a helper function that calculates the maximum sum of slices based on whether the first slice is included or excluded. This approach effectively breaks the problem into two scenarios, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of possible selections. The dynamic programming table was constructed to keep track of the maximum sums achievable with varying numbers of slices taken.

    The final implementation successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was sound. The main takeaway is the importance of considering edge cases in circular arrays and the utility of dynamic programming in optimizing selection problems. The solution is efficient and adheres to the constraints given, making it a robust approach for similar problems in the future. 

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def maxSizeSlices(self, slices: list[int]) -> int:
            n = len(slices)
            k = n // 3  # number of slices you can take
        
            # Helper function to calculate max sum of slices
            def calculateMaxSum(slices, start, end, k):
                dp = [[0] * (end - start + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
                for i in range(start, end + 1):
                    for j in range(min(i - start + 1, k), 0, -1):
                        dp[j][i - start] = max(dp[j][i - start - 1], 
                                               dp[j - 1][i - start - 2] + slices[i])
                return dp[k][end - start]

            # Calculate max sum including first slice (excluding last slice)
            max1 = calculateMaxSum(slices, 0, n - 2, k)
            # Calculate max sum excluding first slice (including last slice)
            max2 = calculateMaxSum(slices, 1, n - 1, k)

            return max(max1, max2)
    ```
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 238 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to determine the maximum profit that can be made from stock prices over a series of days, allowing for at most two buy-sell transactions. The goal is to find the best days to buy and sell stocks to maximize profit, ensuring that we sell before we buy again.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will maintain two arrays to track the maximum profit achievable up to each day with one transaction and two transactions. The first array will keep track of the maximum profit we can achieve with one transaction by iterating through the prices and calculating the maximum profit at each step. The second array will build on the first, allowing us to calculate the maximum profit with two transactions by considering the best day to sell after the first transaction.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function maxProfit(prices):
       if prices is empty:
           return 0
       
       n = length of prices
       create an array profit1 of size n
       create an array profit2 of size n

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to determine the maximum profit that can be made from stock prices over a series of days, allowing for at most two buy-sell transactions. The goal is to find the best days to buy and sell stocks to maximize profit, ensuring that we sell before we buy again.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:


Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

Example 2:


Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.


Example 3:


Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 238 [generation text] In this task, I implemented a solution to find the maximum profit from stock prices with at most two transactions. The core concept involved using dynamic programming to track profits from one and two transactions separately. 

The approach included creating two arrays: `profit1` for the maximum profit achievable with one transaction and `profit2` for the maximum profit with two transactions. The algorithm iterated through the prices to calculate the minimum and maximum prices at each step, updating the profit arrays accordingly. Finally, the maximum profit was derived by combining the values from both profit arrays.

The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test cases. The key takeaway is the effectiveness of dynamic programming in optimizing profit calculations over multiple transactions while maintaining clarity in the logic through separate profit tracking. 

Here’s the final code snippet for future reference:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: list[int]) -> int:
        if not prices:
            return 0
        
        n = len(prices)
        profit1 = [0] * n
        profit2 = [0] * n
        
        min_price = prices[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])
            profit1[i] = max(profit1[i-1], prices[i] - min_price)
        
        max_price = prices[n-1]
        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])
            profit2[i] = max(profit2[i+1], max_price - prices[i])
        
        max_profit = 0
        for i in range(n):
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit1[i] + profit2[i])
        
        return max_profit
``` 

This solution effectively handles the problem constraints and provides a clear method for calculating maximum profit from stock prices.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 238 [generation text] The official solution to the problem of maximizing profit from stock prices with at most two transactions offers a more efficient approach than my initial implementation. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Two-Pass Approach**: The official solution uses a two-pass strategy to calculate maximum profits. The first pass computes the maximum profit that can be achieved from the right side of the array (future prices), while the second pass calculates the maximum profit from the left side (past prices).

2. **Right Maximum Profits Calculation**: 
   - It initializes an array `rmax_profits` to store the maximum profit possible from each day to the end of the list.
   - It iterates backward through the prices, updating the maximum price seen so far (`rmax`) and calculating the potential profit for each day. This allows it to fill the `rmax_profits` array with the best possible profit from that day onward.

3. **Left Maximum Profit Calculation**:
   - In the second pass, it keeps track of the minimum price seen so far (`lmin`) and calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved up to each day.
   - It combines the profits from the left and right calculations to determine the total profit for each day, updating the maximum total profit found.

4. **Efficiency**: The official solution operates in O(n) time complexity with O(n) space complexity, which is efficient for this problem. My initial approach also had O(n) time complexity but was more complex in terms of logic and handling of the profit arrays.

5. **Edge Cases**: The official solution includes a check to return 0 if no profit can be made, which is a good practice to handle edge cases.

Overall, the official solution is insightful in its simplicity and efficiency, demonstrating a clear separation of concerns by handling the left and right profit calculations independently. This structured approach can be a useful reference for similar problems involving multiple transactions or stages.

INFO - [Task id] 238 [generation text] The function calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved from buying and selling stocks on given days, allowing for up to two transactions. It first checks if the prices list is empty and initializes two arrays to track profits from one and two transactions. It then iterates through the prices to compute the maximum profit possible with a single transaction by keeping track of the minimum price seen so far. Next, it calculates the maximum profit for two transactions by iterating backward through the prices to find the maximum price. Finally, it combines the profits from both transactions to determine the overall maximum profit and returns this value.

[Problem]
    Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

    Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

    Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

    Example 1:


    Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
                 Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

    Example 2:


    Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
                 Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
                 engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.


    Example 3:


    Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
