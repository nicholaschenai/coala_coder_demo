    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to determine the maximum profit that can be made from stock prices over a series of days, allowing for at most two buy-sell transactions. The goal is to find the best days to buy and sell stocks to maximize profit, ensuring that we sell before we buy again.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will maintain two arrays to track the maximum profit achievable up to each day with one transaction and two transactions. The first array will keep track of the maximum profit we can achieve with one transaction by iterating through the prices and calculating the maximum profit at each step. The second array will build on the first, allowing us to calculate the maximum profit with two transactions by considering the best day to sell after the first transaction.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function maxProfit(prices):\n       if prices is empty:\n           return 0\n       \n       n = length of prices\n       create an array profit1 of size n\n       create an array profit2 of size n\n       \n       min_price = prices[0]\n       for i from 1 to n-1:\n           min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])\n           profit1[i] = max(profit1[i-1], prices[i] - min_price)\n       \n       max_price = prices[n-1]\n       for i from n-2 down to 0:\n           max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])\n           profit2[i] = max(profit2[i+1], max_price - prices[i])\n       \n       max_profit = 0\n       for i from 0 to n-1:\n           max_profit = max(max_profit, profit1[i] + profit2[i])\n       \n       return max_profit\n\n   read prices\n   print maxProfit(prices)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maxProfit(self, prices: list[int]) -> int:\n        # Check if the prices list is empty\n        if not prices:\n            return 0\n        \n        n = len(prices)  # Get the number of days\n        profit1 = [0] * n  # Array to store max profit with one transaction\n        profit2 = [0] * n  # Array to store max profit with two transactions\n        \n        # Calculate max profit with one transaction\n        min_price = prices[0]  # Initialize the minimum price\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])  # Update the minimum price\n            profit1[i] = max(profit1[i-1], prices[i] - min_price)  # Max profit at day i\n        \n        # Calculate max profit with two transactions\n        max_price = prices[n-1]  # Initialize the maximum price\n        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n            max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])  # Update the maximum price\n            profit2[i] = max(profit2[i+1], max_price - prices[i])  # Max profit at day i\n        \n        # Combine the profits from both transactions\n        max_profit = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit1[i] + profit2[i])  # Max profit overall\n        \n        return max_profit  # Return the maximum profit\n\n# Example usage\n# prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]\n# solution = Solution()\n# print(solution.maxProfit(prices))\n```",
