You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
- N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
- Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
- The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where iâ‰¤j$i \leq j$.
For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
c
co
cod
code
codec
codeco
codecod
codecode
codecodec
codecodeco
...

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains string S$S$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- The second line contains string T$T$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ â€” the number of queries.
- Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

-----Output:-----
- Print Q$Q$ lines. The i$i$-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row.

-----Constraints-----
- 1â‰¤|S|â‰¤105$1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤|T|â‰¤|S|$1 \leq |T| \leq |S|$
- 1â‰¤Qâ‰¤105$1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤Nâ‰¤109$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$

-----Sample Input:-----
codechef
chefcode
3
4
12
1455

-----Sample Output:-----
0
1
181

-----Explanation:-----
Pyramid will be formed as explained in the statement.
Query 1: Row number 4 of the pyramid is code. The number of occurrences of chefcode in code is 0.
Query 2: Row number 12 of the pyramid is codechefcode. The number of occurrences of chefcode in codechefcode is 1.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a string `S` that is used to create an infinite pyramid of rows. Each row `N` contains `N` characters, starting with the first character of `S` and continuing in a cyclic manner through `S` until the row is filled. We also have another string `T`, and we need to answer several queries about how many times `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve the problem, we need to determine the content of the `N`-th row of the pyramid. The row will consist of the first `N` characters of `S`, repeated cyclically. We can calculate the characters in the row using the modulo operation to wrap around the string `S`. Once we have the row, we can count how many times the string `T` appears in it. Given the constraints, we need to ensure our solution is efficient, especially since `N` can be very large (up to 10^9).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
       length_S = length of S
       length_T = length of T
       results = []
       
       for each N in queries:
           # Create the N-th row
           row = ""
           for i from 0 to N-1:
               row += S[i % length_S]
           
           # Count occurrences of T in row
           count = 0
           for i from 0 to (N - length_T):
               if row[i:i + length_T] == T:
                   count += 1
           
           results.append(count)
       
       return results
   ```

    length_S = len(S)
    length_T = len(T)

    [Previous Critique]:
        None
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
           The task is to determine how many subsets can be formed from the numbers 1 to N such that a specific number I appears in the K-th position of the subset when sorted. The output should be the count of such subsets for multiple queries, and since the result can be large, it should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
           To solve this problem, we need to:
           - Understand that for a number I to be in the K-th position of a subset, there must be exactly \(K-1\) numbers less than I in the subset.
           - The remaining numbers in the subset can be chosen from the numbers greater than I.
           - We can use combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of ways to choose \(K-1\) numbers from the \(I-1\) numbers less than I and any number of numbers from the \(N-I\) numbers greater than I.
           - The total number of valid subsets can be calculated using combinations and powers of 2.

        3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
           ```
           function calculate_combinations(n, k):
               if k > n or k < 0:
                   return 0
               return factorial(n) / (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))

           function count_subsets(N, I, K):
               if K > I or K < 1:
                   return 0
               count_less_than_I = calculate_combinations(I - 1, K - 1)
               count_greater_than_I = 2^(N - I)
               return (count_less_than_I * count_greater_than_I) % (10^9 + 7)

           function main():
               read T
               for each test case:
                   read N, Q
                   for each query:
                       read I, K
                       result = count_subsets(N, I, K)
                       print(result)
           ```

        4. **Final Python Code**:
        ```python
        def factorial(n):
            if n == 0 or n == 1:
                return 1
            result = 1
            for i in range(2, n + 1):
                result = (result * i) % (10**9 + 7)
            return result

        def calculate_combinations(n, k):
            if k > n or k < 0:
                return 0
            return (factorial(n) * pow(factorial(k), -1, 10**9 + 7) * pow(factorial(n - k), -1, 10**9 + 7)) % (10**9 + 7)

        def count_subsets(N, I, K):
            if K > I or K < 1:
                return 0
            count_less_than_I = calculate_combinations(I - 1, K - 1)
            count_greater_than_I = pow(2, N - I, 10**9 + 7)
            return (count_less_than_I * count_greater_than_I) % (10**9 + 7)

        def main():
            MOD = 10**9 + 7
            T = int(input())
            for _ in range(T):
                N, Q = map(int, input().split())
                for __ in range(Q):
                    I, K = map(int, input().split())
                    result = count_subsets(N, I, K)
                    print(result)

        main()
        ``` 

        This code reads the number of test cases and queries, processes each query to calculate the number of valid subsets, and prints the results. The use of modular arithmetic ensures that we handle large numbers appropriately.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to generate a specific numerical pattern based on an integer input \( K \) for multiple test cases. The expected output for each test case was a series of lines where each line alternated between 1s and 0s, with the number of lines equal to \( K \). 

    Initially, I misunderstood the output format, generating sequences of increasing and decreasing numbers instead of the required alternating pattern. The key realization was that for each test case, the output should consist of \( K \) lines, each containing the string "10" repeated enough times to cover \( K \) characters, truncated to \( K \) characters.

    The correct approach involved constructing each line by simply repeating "10" and slicing it to the appropriate length. The final code correctly implemented this logic:

    ```python
    def print_pattern(T):
        for t in range(T):
            K = int(input())

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine how many rooms in two houses can be completely tiled using tiles from boxes, where the i-th box contains i tiles and each room has an area of \(i^2\). The key insight was that only even-numbered boxes could be used to tile two rooms completely, as the tiles need to be split evenly between the two rooms.

    Initially, I miscalculated the total number of rooms that could be tiled by simply counting all even boxes and multiplying by 2, which led to incorrect outputs. The correct approach required understanding that for each even box \(i\), it could tile two rooms of size \((i/2)^2\) only if \(i\) was less than or equal to \(N\).

    The final solution should have focused on counting how many even numbers exist up to \(N\) and then determining how many rooms could be tiled based on those even numbers. The correct formula for the number of rooms that can be tiled is \(N // 2\), as each even number contributes exactly 2 rooms.

    Hereâ€™s the corrected code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(N):
        return (N // 2) * 2  # Each even number contributes 2 rooms

    def main():
        T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N
            result = count_tiled_rooms(N)  # Calculate the total tiled rooms
            print(result)  # Output the result

    main()
    ```

INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] 1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
   The task is to create a pyramid of strings based on a given string \( S \). Each row \( N \) of the pyramid contains \( N \) characters, starting with the first character of \( S \) and continuing in a cyclic manner through \( S \) until the row is filled. We need to answer multiple queries about how many times a smaller string \( T \) appears as a substring in the specified row of the pyramid.

2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
   - For each query, we need to determine the string that corresponds to row \( N \) of the pyramid.
   - The string for row \( N \) can be constructed by taking the first character of \( S \) and then appending characters from \( S \) in a cyclic manner until we reach \( N \) characters.
   - Once we have the string for row \( N \), we can count the occurrences of string \( T \) within it. This can be done by sliding through the string and checking for matches.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
- N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
- Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
- The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where iâ‰¤j$i \leq j$.
For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
c
co
cod
code
codec
codeco
codecod
codecode
codecodec
codecodeco
...

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains string S$S$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- The second line contains string T$T$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ â€” the number of queries.
- Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

-----Output:-----
- Print Q$Q$ lines. The i$i$-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row.

-----Constraints-----
- 1â‰¤|S|â‰¤105$1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤|T|â‰¤|S|$1 \leq |T| \leq |S|$
- 1â‰¤Qâ‰¤105$1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤Nâ‰¤109$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$

-----Sample Input:-----

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] In this task, I was required to construct a pyramid of strings based on a given string \( S \) and answer multiple queries about the occurrences of a smaller string \( T \) within specific rows of the pyramid. The core concepts involved string manipulation, cyclic indexing, and substring counting.

The solution involved two main functions: one to generate the string for a given row \( N \) by cycling through \( S \), and another to count the occurrences of \( T \) in that generated string. The approach was straightforward, leveraging basic string operations and loops.

The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. The key takeaway was the importance of efficiently constructing the row string and accurately counting substrings, especially given the constraints where \( N \) could be as large as \( 10^9 \). 

The code snippet for generating the row string and counting occurrences is as follows:

```python
def get_row_string(S, N):
    length_S = len(S)
    row_string = ""
    for i in range(N):
        row_string += S[i % length_S]
    return row_string

def count_occurrences(row_string, T):
    count = 0
    length_T = len(T)
    for i in range(len(row_string) - length_T + 1):
        if row_string[i:i + length_T] == T:
            count += 1
    return count
```

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding string manipulation techniques and the efficiency of operations when dealing with potentially large inputs.

    length_S = len(S)
    row_string = ""
    for i in range(N):
        row_string += S[i % length_S]
    return row_string

def count_occurrences(row_string, T):
    count = 0
    length_T = len(T)
    for i in range(len(row_string) - length_T + 1):
        if row_string[i:i + length_T] == T:
            count += 1
    return count

def main():
    S = input().strip()  # Read the string S
    T = input().strip()  # Read the string T
    Q = int(input().strip())  # Read the number of queries
    for _ in range(Q):
        N = int(input().strip())  # Read each query N
        row_string = get_row_string(S, N)  # Get the row string for N
        result = count_occurrences(row_string, T)  # Count occurrences of T
        print(result)  # Print the result

main()
``` 

This code reads the input strings and the number of queries, constructs the appropriate row string for each query, counts the occurrences of \( T \) in that string, and prints the results.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] The official solution employs a more efficient approach to solve the problem of counting occurrences of a substring \( T \) in the rows of a pyramid constructed from string \( S \). Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **KMP Algorithm**: The solution utilizes the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for substring searching, which is efficient for finding occurrences of a pattern within a string. This is a significant improvement over the naive substring search method, especially given the constraints where \( N \) can be as large as \( 10^9 \).

2. **Cyclic Nature of the Pyramid**: The solution recognizes that the pyramid rows are constructed in a cyclic manner from \( S \). By doubling the string \( S \) (i.e., \( S + S \)), the algorithm can handle the cyclic nature without explicitly constructing the entire row string for large \( N \).

3. **Preprocessing with LPS Array**: The KMP algorithm first preprocesses the pattern \( T \) to create a Longest Prefix Suffix (LPS) array, which helps in efficiently finding matches while searching through the doubled string.

4. **Binary Search for Occurrences**: The solution uses a binary search method to count how many times the substring \( T \) can fit into the constructed row string based on the calculated lengths. This is done by determining how many complete cycles of \( S \) fit into the row and how many additional characters are needed.

5. **Handling Multiple Queries**: The solution efficiently handles multiple queries by precomputing the necessary information and using it to quickly answer each query without reconstructing the row string each time.

Overall, the official solution is more efficient in both time and space complexity compared to the initial approach. It avoids the need to construct large strings directly and instead leverages the properties of the KMP algorithm and binary search to achieve the desired results. This experience highlights the importance of considering algorithmic efficiency, especially when dealing with large input sizes.

[Problem]
    Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
    - N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
    - Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
    - The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
    He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
    You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where iâ‰¤j$i \leq j$.
    For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
    c
    co
    cod
    code
    codec
    codeco
    codecod
    codecode
    codecodec
    codecodeco
    ...

    -----Input:-----
    - The first line contains string S$S$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
    - The second line contains string T$T$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
    - Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ â€” the number of queries.
    - Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

    -----Output:-----
    - Print Q$Q$ lines. The i$i$-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1â‰¤|S|â‰¤105$1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$
    - 1â‰¤|T|â‰¤|S|$1 \leq |T| \leq |S|$
    - 1â‰¤Qâ‰¤105$1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$
    - 1â‰¤Nâ‰¤109$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$

    -----Sample Input:-----
    codechef
    chefcode
    3
    4
    12
    1455

    -----Sample Output:-----
    0
    1
    181

    -----Explanation:-----
    Pyramid will be formed as explained in the statement.
    Query 1: Row number 4 of the pyramid is code. The number of occurrences of chefcode in code is 0.
    Query 2: Row number 12 of the pyramid is codechefcode. The number of occurrences of chefcode in codechefcode is 1.
