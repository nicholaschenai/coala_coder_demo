Each row `N` contains `N` characters, starting with the first character of `S` and continuing in a cyclic manner through `S` until the row is filled. We also have another string `T`, and we need to answer several queries about how many times `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve the problem, we need to determine the content of the `N`-th row of the pyramid. The row will consist of the first `N` characters of `S`, repeated cyclically. We can calculate the characters in the row using the modulo operation to wrap around the string `S`. Once we have the row, we can count how many times the string `T` appears in it. Given the constraints, we need to ensure our solution is efficient, especially since `N` can be very large (up to 10^9).\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n       length_S = length of S\n       length_T = length of T\n       results = []\n       \n       for each N in queries:\n           # Create the N-th row\n           row = \"\"\n           for i from 0 to N-1:\n               row += S[i % length_S]\n           \n           # Count occurrences of T in row\n           count = 0\n           for i from 0 to (N - length_T):\n               if row[i:i + length_T] == T:\n                   count += 1\n           \n           results.append(count)\n       \n       return results\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n    # Get the lengths of S and T\n    length_S = len(S)\n    length_T = len(T)\n    results = []\n    \n    # Process each query\n    for N in queries:\n        # Create the N-th row using cyclic pattern\n        row = \"\"\n        for i in range(N):\n            row += S[i % length_S]\n        \n        # Count occurrences of T in the row\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(N - length_T + 1):\n            if row[i:i + length_T] == T:\n                count += 1\n        \n        # Store the result for this query\n        results.append(count)\n    \n    return results\n\n# Read input\nS = input().strip()\nT = input().strip()\nQ = int(input().strip())\nqueries = [int(input().strip()) for _ in range(Q)]\n\n# Get the results\nresults = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)\n\n# Print the results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```"

The expected output for each test case was a series of lines where each line alternated between 1s and 0s, with the number of lines equal to \\( K \\). \n\n    Initially, I misunderstood the output format, generating sequences of increasing and decreasing numbers instead of the required alternating pattern. The key realization was that for each test case, the output should consist of \\( K \\) lines, each containing the string \"10\" repeated enough times to cover \\( K \\) characters, truncated to \\( K \\) characters.\n\n    The correct approach involved constructing each line by simply repeating \"10\" and slicing it to the appropriate length. The final code correctly implemented this logic:\n\n    ```python\n    def print_pattern(T):\n        for t in range(T):\n            K = int(input())\n            pattern = \"10\" * K\n            for i in range(K):\n                print(pattern[:K])\n\n    T = int(input())\n    print_pattern(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully interpreting the problem requirements and the expected output format. It also reinforced the need to validate the logic against sample inputs to ensure alignment with the problem's specifications.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine how many rooms in two houses can be completely tiled using tiles from boxes, where the i-th box contains i tiles and each room has an area of \\(i^2\\). The key insight was that only even-numbered boxes could be used to tile two rooms completely, as the tiles need to be split evenly between the two rooms.\n\n    Initially, I miscalculated the total number of rooms that could be tiled by simply counting all even boxes and multiplying by 2, which led to incorrect outputs. The correct approach required understanding that for each even box \\(i\\), it could tile two rooms of size \\((i/2)^2\\) only if \\(i\\) was less than or equal to \\(N\\).\n\n    The final solution should have focused on counting how many even numbers exist up to \\(N\\) and then determining how many rooms could be tiled based on those even numbers. The correct formula for the number of rooms that can be tiled is \\(N // 2\\), as each even number contributes exactly 2 rooms.\n\n    Here\u2019s the corrected code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def count_tiled_rooms(N):\n        return (N // 2) * 2  # Each even number contributes 2 rooms\n\n    def main():\n        T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N\n            result = count_tiled_rooms(N)  # Calculate the total tiled rooms\n            print(result)  # Output the result\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing the problem requirements and ensuring that the logic aligns with the constraints provided.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

        "content": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach to solve the problem of counting occurrences of a substring \\( T \\) in the rows of a pyramid constructed from string \\( S \\). Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **KMP Algorithm**: The solution utilizes the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for substring searching, which is efficient for finding occurrences of a pattern within a string. This is a significant improvement over the naive substring search method, especially given the constraints where \\( N \\) can be as large as \\( 10^9 \\).\n\n2. **Cyclic Nature of the Pyramid**: The solution recognizes that the pyramid rows are constructed in a cyclic manner from \\( S \\). By doubling the string \\( S \\) (i.e., \\( S + S \\)), the algorithm can handle the cyclic nature without explicitly constructing the entire row string for large \\( N \\).\n\n3. **Preprocessing with LPS Array**: The KMP algorithm first preprocesses the pattern \\( T \\) to create a Longest Prefix Suffix (LPS) array, which helps in efficiently finding matches while searching through the doubled string.\n\n4. **Binary Search for Occurrences**: The solution uses a binary search method to count how many times the substring \\( T \\) can fit into the constructed row string based on the calculated lengths. This is done by determining how many complete cycles of \\( S \\) fit into the row and how many additional characters are needed.\n\n5. **Handling Multiple Queries**: The solution efficiently handles multiple queries by precomputing the necessary information and using it to quickly answer each query without reconstructing the row string each time.\n\nOverall, the official solution is more efficient in both time and space complexity compared to the initial approach. It avoids the need to construct large strings directly and instead leverages the properties of the KMP algorithm and binary search to achieve the desired results. This experience highlights the importance of considering algorithmic efficiency, especially when dealing with large input sizes."

        "content": "\n[description for function: main]\nThis function reads a string and a pattern from user input, along with the number of queries to process. For each query, it retrieves a specified number of characters from the string in a cyclic manner to form a new string. It then counts how many times the specified pattern appears in this newly formed string. Finally, it prints the count of occurrences for each query. The function effectively handles multiple queries in a single execution. Overall, it combines string manipulation and pattern matching based on user input.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to analyze patterns in cyclic strings, particularly in competitive programming or algorithm design. It can be applied in problems involving string manipulation, substring search, and efficient handling of large inputs, especially when the constraints allow for very large values of N. Understanding how to construct strings based on cyclic patterns can also help in optimizing solutions to avoid unnecessary computations, especially when dealing with repeated queries."
