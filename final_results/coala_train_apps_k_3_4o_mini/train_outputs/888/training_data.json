    "summary": "In this task, I was required to construct a pyramid of strings based on a given string \\( S \\) and answer multiple queries about the occurrences of a smaller string \\( T \\) within specific rows of the pyramid. The core concepts involved string manipulation, cyclic indexing, and substring counting.\n\nThe solution involved two main functions: one to generate the string for a given row \\( N \\) by cycling through \\( S \\), and another to count the occurrences of \\( T \\) in that generated string. The approach was straightforward, leveraging basic string operations and loops.\n\nThe final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. The key takeaway was the importance of efficiently constructing the row string and accurately counting substrings, especially given the constraints where \\( N \\) could be as large as \\( 10^9 \\). \n\nThe code snippet for generating the row string and counting occurrences is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef get_row_string(S, N):\n    length_S = len(S)\n    row_string = \"\"\n    for i in range(N):\n        row_string += S[i % length_S]\n    return row_string\n\ndef count_occurrences(row_string, T):\n    count = 0\n    length_T = len(T)\n    for i in range(len(row_string) - length_T + 1):\n        if row_string[i:i + length_T] == T:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\nOverall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding string manipulation techniques and the efficiency of operations when dealing with potentially large inputs.",
    "reflection": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach to solve the problem of counting occurrences of a substring \\( T \\) in the rows of a pyramid constructed from string \\( S \\). Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **KMP Algorithm**: The solution utilizes the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for substring searching, which is efficient for finding occurrences of a pattern within a string. This is a significant improvement over the naive substring search method, especially given the constraints where \\( N \\) can be as large as \\( 10^9 \\).\n\n2. **Cyclic Nature of the Pyramid**: The solution recognizes that the pyramid rows are constructed in a cyclic manner from \\( S \\). By doubling the string \\( S \\) (i.e., \\( S + S \\)), the algorithm can handle the cyclic nature without explicitly constructing the entire row string for large \\( N \\).\n\n3. **Preprocessing with LPS Array**: The KMP algorithm first preprocesses the pattern \\( T \\) to create a Longest Prefix Suffix (LPS) array, which helps in efficiently finding matches while searching through the doubled string.\n\n4. **Binary Search for Occurrences**: The solution uses a binary search method to count how many times the substring \\( T \\) can fit into the constructed row string based on the calculated lengths. This is done by determining how many complete cycles of \\( S \\) fit into the row and how many additional characters are needed.\n\n5. **Handling Multiple Queries**: The solution efficiently handles multiple queries by precomputing the necessary information and using it to quickly answer each query without reconstructing the row string each time.\n\nOverall, the official solution is more efficient in both time and space complexity compared to the initial approach. It avoids the need to construct large strings directly and instead leverages the properties of the KMP algorithm and binary search to achieve the desired results. This experience highlights the importance of considering algorithmic efficiency, especially when dealing with large input sizes.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThis function reads a string and a pattern from user input, along with the number of queries to process. For each query, it retrieves a specified number of characters from the string in a cyclic manner to form a new string. It then counts how many times the specified pattern appears in this newly formed string. Finally, it prints the count of occurrences for each query. The function effectively handles multiple queries in a single execution. Overall, it combines string manipulation and pattern matching based on user input.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to analyze patterns in cyclic strings, particularly in competitive programming or algorithm design. It can be applied in problems involving string manipulation, substring search, and efficient handling of large inputs, especially when the constraints allow for very large values of N. Understanding how to construct strings based on cyclic patterns can also help in optimizing solutions to avoid unnecessary computations, especially when dealing with repeated queries."
