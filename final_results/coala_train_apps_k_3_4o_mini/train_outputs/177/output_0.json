    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to find the smallest substring in a given string \\( S \\) that contains all the characters from another string \\( T \\). If no such substring exists, we should return an empty string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We will maintain a window that expands to include characters from \\( T \\) and contracts to find the minimum length that still contains all characters from \\( T \\). We will use two pointers to represent the current window and a dictionary to count the occurrences of characters in \\( T \\) within the window. As we expand the window by moving the right pointer, we will check if we have all characters from \\( T \\). If we do, we will try to contract the window from the left to find the minimum length.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function minWindow(S, T):\n       create a dictionary to count characters in T\n       initialize two pointers for the window\n       initialize variables to track the minimum length and result\n       \n       while right pointer is less than length of S:\n           include character at right pointer in the window\n           check if window contains all characters from T\n           \n           while window contains all characters:\n               update minimum length and result if current window is smaller\n               exclude character at left pointer from the window\n               move left pointer to the right\n       \n       return result if found, else return empty string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:\n        # Dictionary to count characters in T\n        char_count = {}\n        for char in t:\n            char_count[char] = char_count.get(char, 0) + 1\n        \n        # Number of unique characters in T that need to be present in the window\n        required = len(char_count)\n        # Left and right pointers for the sliding window\n        left, right = 0, 0\n        # Formed keeps track of how many unique characters in T are currently in the window\n        formed = 0\n        # Dictionary to keep track of characters in the current window\n        window_counts = {}\n        # Result variables to store the minimum length and the starting index of the window\n        min_length = float('inf')\n        min_left = 0\n        \n        # Start sliding the window\n        while right < len(s):\n            # Add character from the right pointer to the window\n            char = s[right]\n            window_counts[char] = window_counts.get(char, 0) + 1\n            \n            # Check if the current character's count matches the required count in T\n            if char in char_count and window_counts[char] == char_count[char]:\n                formed += 1\n            \n            # Try to contract the window until it ceases to be 'desirable'\n            while left <= right and formed == required:\n                char = s[left]\n                \n                # Update the minimum length and starting index if a smaller window is found\n                if right - left + 1 < min_length:\n                    min_length = right - left + 1\n                    min_left = left\n                \n                # Remove the leftmost character from the window\n                window_counts[char] -= 1\n                if char in char_count and window_counts[char] < char_count[char]:\n                    formed -= 1\n                \n                # Move the left pointer to the right\n                left += 1\n            \n            # Move the right pointer to the right\n            right += 1\n        \n        # Return the minimum window substring or an empty string if no valid window was found\n        return \"\" if min_length == float('inf') else s[min_left:min_left + min_length]\n```",
