    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The problem involves planning train travel on specific days of the year, where you can buy different types of train tickets (1-day, 7-day, and 30-day passes) at varying costs. The goal is to determine the minimum amount of money needed to cover all the travel days using the available ticket options.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to cover travel up to day `i`. For each travel day, we will consider the cost of each type of ticket and update our `dp` array accordingly. We will iterate through each travel day and calculate the minimum cost by considering the cost of buying a ticket for that day and the previous days covered by that ticket.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Initialize a dp array of size 366 (to cover days 1 to 365) with infinity\n   Set dp[0] = 0 (no cost for day 0)\n   For each day in the travel days:\n       For each ticket type (1-day, 7-day, 30-day):\n           Calculate the cost if the ticket is bought on that day\n           Update the dp array for the days covered by that ticket\n   Return the minimum cost from the dp array for the last travel day\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def mincostTickets(self, days: list[int], costs: list[int]) -> int:\n        # Initialize a dp array with size 366 (to cover days 1 to 365)\n        dp = [float('inf')] * 366\n        dp[0] = 0  # No cost for day 0\n\n        # Set of travel days for quick lookup\n        travel_days = set(days)\n\n        # Iterate through each day of the year\n        for day in range(1, 366):\n            if day in travel_days:\n                # Calculate the minimum cost for each ticket type\n                dp[day] = min(dp[day], dp[day - 1] + costs[0])  # 1-day pass\n                dp[day] = min(dp[day], dp[max(0, day - 7)] + costs[1])  # 7-day pass\n                dp[day] = min(dp[day], dp[max(0, day - 30)] + costs[2])  # 30-day pass\n            else:\n                # If it's not a travel day, carry forward the previous cost\n                dp[day] = dp[day - 1]\n\n        # The answer is the minimum cost to cover all travel days\n        return dp[365]\n```",
