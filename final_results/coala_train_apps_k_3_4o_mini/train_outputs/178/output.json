    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to find the length of the longest subsequence in a given list of integers where the subsequence is strictly increasing. For example, in the list [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18], the longest increasing subsequence is [2, 3, 7, 101], which has a length of 4.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. We will create an array `d` where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. We will iterate through the list, and for each element, we will check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. The final answer will be the maximum value in the `d` array.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function lengthOfLIS(nums):\n       if nums is empty:\n           return 0\n       \n       n = length of nums\n       create an array d of size n, initialized to 1\n       \n       for i from 1 to n-1:\n           for j from 0 to i-1:\n               if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                   d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n       \n       return max value in d\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Check if the input list is empty\n        if not nums:\n            return 0\n        \n        n = len(nums)  # Get the length of the input list\n        d = [1] * n  # Initialize the dp array with 1s\n        \n        # Iterate through the list to fill the dp array\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            for j in range(i):\n                # If the current number is greater than the previous number\n                if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                    # Update the dp value for the current index\n                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n        # The length of the longest increasing subsequence is the max value in d\n        return max(d)\n```",
