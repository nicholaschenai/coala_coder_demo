example\n\n        $$\\begin{array}{ll}\n        a &= \\{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\\} \\\\\n        d &= \\{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\\}\n        \\end{array}$$\n\n        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\\{3, 4, 5\\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\\}$ or $\\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\\{0, 1\\}$ having length 2.\n\n    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.\n    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.\n\n    So let the current index be $i$.\n    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \\dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.\n    Then there are two options:\n\n    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.\n\n    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.\n\n        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.\n        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.\n\n        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.\n        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.\n  \n        $$d[i] = \\max_{\\substack{j < i \\\\\\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \\left(d[j] + 1\\right)$$\n\n    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:\n\n    $$d[i] = \\max\\left(1, \\max_{\\substack{j < i \\\\\\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \\left(d[j] + 1\\right)\\right)$$\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}\n    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i])\n                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0];\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            ans = max(ans, d[i]);\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Restoring the subsequence\n\n    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.\n\n    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \\dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.\n    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.\n    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.\n    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.\n\n    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.\n\n    ### Implementation of restoring\n\n    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.\n    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.\n\n    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.\n    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}\n    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i] && d[i] < d[j] + 1) {\n                    d[i] = d[j] + 1;\n                    p[i] = j;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0], pos = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            if (d[i] > ans) {\n                ans = d[i];\n                pos = i;\n            }\n        }\n\n        vector<int> subseq;\n        while (pos != -1) {\n            subseq.push_back(a[pos]);\n            pos = p[pos];\n        }\n        reverse(subseq.begin(), subseq.end());\n        return subseq;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    In reflecting on my attempts to solve the problem, I recognize that my approach was fundamentally sound but lacked efficiency in terms of time complexity. My solution utilized a binary search method to find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS), which is generally efficient. However, the official solution employs a simpler dynamic programming approach that, while potentially less efficient in terms of time complexity (O(N^2)), is straightforward and easier to understand.\n\n    The official solution first checks if the array is already sorted. If it is, it immediately returns 0, which is a good optimization. If not, it initializes a list `l` to keep track of the lengths of increasing subsequences. The nested loops then iterate through the array to build the LIS by comparing each element with all previous elements. The final output is derived by subtracting the length of the longest increasing subsequence from the total number of books, which gives the minimum number of moves required.\n\n    Key insights from the official solution:\n    1. **Early Exit for Sorted Input**: Checking if the array is already sorted can save unnecessary computations.\n    2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The use of a simple nested loop to build the LIS is effective for smaller inputs and is easier to implement and understand.\n    3. **Simplicity Over Complexity**: Sometimes, a simpler solution can be more effective, especially when the input size is manageable.\n\n    In future problems, I will consider both the efficiency and clarity of my solutions, and I will also look for opportunities to optimize early exits when possible.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Longest increasing subsequence\n    Part: 2/3\n    ```\n\n    ### Alternative way of restoring the subsequence\n\n    It is also possible to restore the subsequence without the auxiliary array $p[]$.\n    We can simply recalculate the current value of $d[i]$ and also see how the maximum was reached.\n\n    This method leads to a slightly longer code, but in return we save some memory.\n\n    ## Solution in $O(n \\log n)$ with dynamic programming and binary search {data-toc-label=\"Solution in O(n log n) with dynamic programming and binary search\"}\n\n    In order to obtain a faster solution for the problem, we construct a different dynamic programming solution that runs in $O(n^2)$, and then later improve it to $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    We will use the dynamic programming array $d[0 \\dots n]$.\n    This time $d[l]$ doesn't corresponds to the element $a[i]$ or to an prefix of the array. \n    $d[l]$ will be the smallest element at which an increasing subsequence of length $l$ ends.\n\n    Initially we assume $d[0] = -\\infty$ and for all other lengths $d[l] = \\infty$.\n\n    We will again gradually process the numbers, first $a[0]$, then $a[1]$, etc, and in each step maintain the array $d[]$ so that it is up to date.\n\n    !!! example\n\n        Given the array $a = \\{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\\}$, here are all their prefixes and their dynamic programming array.\n        Notice, that the values of the array don't always change at the end.\n\n        $$\n        \\begin{array}{ll}\n        \\text{prefix} = \\{\\} &\\quad d = \\{-\\infty, \\infty, \\dots\\}\\\\\n        \\text{prefix} = \\{8\\} &\\quad d = \\{-\\infty, 8, \\infty, \\dots\\}\\\\\n        \\text{prefix} = \\{8, 3\\} &\\quad d = \\{-\\infty, 3, \\infty, \\dots\\}\\\\\n        \\text{prefix} = \\{8, 3, 4\\} &\\quad d = \\{-\\infty, 3, 4, \\infty, \\dots\\}\\\\\n        \\text{prefix} = \\{8, 3, 4, 6\\} &\\quad d = \\{-\\infty, 3, 4, 6, \\infty, \\dots\\}\\\\\n        \\text{prefix} = \\{8, 3, 4, 6, 5\\} &\\quad d = \\{-\\infty, 3, 4, 5, \\infty, \\dots\\}\\\\\n        \\text{prefix} = \\{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2\\} &\\quad d = \\{-\\infty, 2, 4, 5, \\infty, \\dots \\}\\\\\n        \\text{prefix} = \\{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0\\} &\\quad d = \\{-\\infty, 0, 4, 5, \\infty, \\dots \\}\\\\\n        \\text{prefix} = \\{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7\\} &\\quad d = \\{-\\infty, 0, 4, 5, 7, \\infty, \\dots \\}\\\\\n        \\text{prefix} = \\{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9\\} &\\quad d = \\{-\\infty, 0, 4, 5, 7, 9, \\infty, \\dots \\}\\\\\n        \\text{prefix} = \\{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\\} &\\quad d = \\{-\\infty, 0, 1, 5, 7, 9, \\infty, \\dots \\}\\\\\n        \\end{array}\n        $$\n\n    When we process $a[i]$, we can ask ourselves.\n    What have the conditions to be, that we write the current number $a[i]$ into the $d[0 \\dots n]$ array?\n\n    We set $d[l] = a[i]$, if there is a longest increasing sequence of length $l$ that ends in $a[i]$, and there is no longest increasing sequence of length $l$ that ends in a smaller number.\n    Similar to the previous approach, if we remove the number $a[i]$ from the longest increasing sequence of length $l$, we get another longest increasing sequence of length $l -1$.\n    So we want to extend a longest increasing sequence of length $l - 1$ by the number $a[i]$, and obviously the longest increasing sequence of length $l - 1$ that ends with the smallest element will work the best, in other words the sequence of length $l-1$ that ends in element $d[l-1]$.\n\n    There is a longest increasing sequence of length $l - 1$ that we can extend with the number $a[i]$, exactly if $d[l-1] < a[i]$.\n    So we can just iterate over each length $l$, and check if we can extend a longest increasing sequence of length $l - 1$ by checking the criteria.\n\n    Additionally we also need to check, if we maybe have already found a longest increasing sequence of length $l$ with a smaller number at the end.\n    So we only update if $a[i] < d[l]$.\n\n    After processing all the elements of $a[]$ the length of the desired subsequence is the largest $l$ with $d[l] < \\infty$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_method2_n2}\n    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        const int INF = 1e9;\n        vector<int> d(n+1, INF);\n        d[0] = -INF;\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int l = 1; l <= n; l++) {\n                if (d[l-1] < a[i] && a[i] < d[l])\n                    d[l] = a[i];\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = 0;\n        for (int l = 0; l <= n; l++) {\n            if (d[l] < INF)\n                ans = l;\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    We now make two important observations.\n\n    1.  The array $d$ will always be sorted: \n        $d[l-1] < d[l]$ for all $i = 1 \\dots n$.\n\n        This is trivial, as you can just remove the last element from the increasing subsequence of length $l$, and you get a increasing subsequence of length $l-1$ with a smalller ending number.\n\n    2.  The element $a[i]$ will only update at most one value $d[l]$.\n\n        This follows immediately from the above implementation.\n        There can only be one place in the array with $d[l-1] < a[i] < d[l]$.\n\n    Thus we can find this element in the array $d[]$ using [binary search](../num_methods/binary_search.md) in $O(\\log n)$.\n    In fact we can simply look in the array $d[]$ for the first number that is strictly greater than $a[i]$, and we try to update this element in the same way as the above implementation.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    This gives us the improved $O(n \\log n)$ implementation:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_method2_nlogn}\n    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        const int INF = 1e9;\n        vector<int> d(n+1, INF);\n        d[0] = -INF;\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            int l = upper_bound(d.begin(), d.end(), a[i]) - d.begin();\n            if (d[l-1] < a[i] && a[i] < d[l])\n                d[l] = a[i];\n        }\n\n        int ans = 0;\n        for (int l = 0; l <= n; l++) {\n            if (d[l] < INF)\n                ans = l;\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

        "content": "In this task, I was required to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted array of integers. The problem was approached using a dynamic programming technique, which is a common strategy for problems involving subsequences. The key concept was to maintain an array `d` where each element represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends at that index.\n\nThe solution involved iterating through the input list and comparing each element with all previous elements to determine if they could form an increasing subsequence. If they could, the length of the subsequence was updated accordingly. The final result was obtained by finding the maximum value in the `d` array.\n\nThe implemented code was as follows:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        if not nums:\n            return 0\n        \n        n = len(nums)\n        d = [1] * n\n        \n        for i in range(1, n):\n            for j in range(i):\n                if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n        return max(d)\n```\n\nThis approach successfully passed the provided test case, demonstrating its correctness. The dynamic programming method is efficient for this problem, operating in O(n^2) time complexity, which is suitable given the constraints. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of dynamic programming in solving subsequence-related problems."

        "content": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) using a combination of dynamic programming and binary search, achieving a time complexity of O(n log n). This is a significant improvement over the O(n^2) complexity of my initial solution.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The solution starts by checking if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns 0. It initializes a list `res` to keep track of the smallest tail values of increasing subsequences found so far.\n\n2. **Binary Search**: The solution defines a helper function `binarySearch` that performs a binary search on the `res` list to find the position where the current number can replace an existing value or be appended. This ensures that `res` remains sorted and allows for efficient updates.\n\n3. **Iterating through the List**: For each number in the input list, the solution checks if it is greater than the last element in `res`. If it is, it appends the number to `res`. If not, it uses the `binarySearch` function to find the appropriate position to replace an element in `res`, maintaining the potential for longer increasing subsequences.\n\n4. **Final Result**: The length of the `res` list at the end of the iteration represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\nThis approach is more efficient because it reduces the number of comparisons needed to maintain the increasing subsequence, leveraging the properties of sorted lists and binary search. In contrast, my initial solution, while correct, was less efficient due to the nested loops that checked all previous elements for each current element. \n\nIn future implementations, I will consider using binary search techniques to optimize problems involving sorted data or subsequences, as this can significantly enhance performance."

        "content": "\n[description]\nThis function calculates the length of the longest increasing subsequence in a given list of integers. It first checks if the list is empty and returns 0 if so. It initializes a dynamic programming array to keep track of the longest subsequence lengths at each index. The function then iterates through the list, comparing each element with the previous ones to update the dp array accordingly. Finally, it returns the maximum value found in the dp array, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to analyze sequences of numbers to find patterns, such as in data analysis, algorithm design, and competitive programming. It can be applied in fields like finance for trend analysis, in computer science for optimizing search algorithms, and in machine learning for feature selection. Understanding how to find the longest increasing subsequence can also help in solving more complex problems that involve sequences and order, making it a fundamental concept in algorithm studies."
