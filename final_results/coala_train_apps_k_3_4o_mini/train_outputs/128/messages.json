The solution required iterating through the string, handling digits to form numbers, and using a stack to manage nested structures created by brackets.\n\n    Key concepts included:\n    - Building numbers from digits, which could be more than one digit long.\n    - Using a stack to keep track of the current string and repeat counts when encountering opening brackets.\n    - Repeating the current string and appending it to the last string when encountering closing brackets.\n\n    The implemented solution effectively handled these requirements by maintaining a `current_string` and `current_num`, and using a stack to manage nested encodings. The final code successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was sound and efficient.\n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:\n            stack = []\n            current_num = 0\n            current_string = \"\"\n\n            for char in s:\n                if char.isdigit():\n                    current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)\n                elif char == '[':\n                    stack.append((current_string, current_num))\n                    current_string = \"\"\n                    current_num = 0\n                elif char == ']':\n                    last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()\n                    current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count\n                else:\n                    current_string += char\n\n            return current_string\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of using stacks for managing nested structures and highlighted the need to carefully handle string and number manipulations in such encoding problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Expression parsing\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Expression parsing\n\n    A string containing a mathematical expression containing numbers and various operators is given.\n    We have to compute the value of it in $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string.\n\n    The algorithm discussed here translates an expression into the so-called **reverse Polish notation** (explicitly or implicitly), and evaluates this expression.\n\n    ## Reverse Polish notation\n\n    The reverse Polish notation is a form of writing mathematical expressions, in which the operators are located after their operands.\n    For example the following expression\n\n    $$a + b * c * d + (e - f) * (g * h + i)$$\n\n    can be written in reverse Polish notation in the following way:\n\n    $$a b c * d * + e f - g h * i + * +$$\n\n    The reverse Polish notation was developed by the Australian philosopher and computer science specialist Charles Hamblin in the mid 1950s on the basis of the Polish notation, which was proposed in 1920 by the Polish mathematician Jan \u0141ukasiewicz.\n\n    The convenience of the reverse Polish notation is, that expressions in this form are very **easy to evaluate** in linear time.\n    We use a stack, which is initially empty.\n    We will iterate over the operands and operators of the expression in reverse Polish notation.\n    If the current element is a number, then we put the value on top of the stack, if the current element is an operator, then we get the top two elements from the stack, perform the operation, and put the result back on top of the stack.\n    In the end there will be exactly one element left in the stack, which will be the value of the expression.\n\n    Obviously this simple evaluation runs in $O(n)$ time.\n\n    ## Parsing of simple expressions\n\n    For the time being we only consider a simplified problem:\n    we assume that all operators are **binary** (i.e. they take two arguments), and all are **left-associative** (if the priorities are equal, they get executed from left to right).\n    Parentheses are allowed.\n\n    We will set up two stacks: one for numbers, and one for operators and parentheses.\n    Initially both stacks are empty.\n    For the second stack we will maintain the condition that all operations are ordered by strict descending priority.\n    If there are parenthesis on the stack, than each block of operators (corresponding to one pair of parenthesis) is ordered, and the entire stack is not necessarily ordered.\n\n    We will iterate over the characters of the expression from left to right.\n    If the current character is a digit, then we put the value of this number on the stack.\n    If the current character is an opening parenthesis, then we put it on the stack.\n    If the current character is a closing parenthesis, the we execute all operators on the stack until we reach the opening bracket (in other words we perform all operations inside the parenthesis).\n    Finally if the current character is an operator, then while the top of the stack has an operator with the same or higher priority, we will execute this operation, and put the new operation on the stack.\n\n    After we processed the entire string, some operators might still be in the stack, so we execute them.\n\n    Here is the implementation of this method for the four operators $+$ $-$ $*$ $/$:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=expression_parsing_simple}\n    bool delim(char c) {\n        return c == ' ';\n    }\n\n    bool is_op(char c) {\n        return c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*' || c == '/';\n    }\n\n    int priority (char op) {\n        if (op == '+' || op == '-')\n            return 1;\n        if (op == '*' || op == '/')\n            return 2;\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    void process_op(stack<int>& st, char op) {\n        int r = st.top(); st.pop();\n        int l = st.top(); st.pop();\n        switch (op) {\n            case '+': st.push(l + r); break;\n            case '-': st.push(l - r); break;\n            case '*': st.push(l * r); break;\n            case '/': st.push(l / r); break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    int evaluate(string& s) {\n        stack<int> st;\n        stack<char> op;\n        for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); i++) {\n            if (delim(s[i]))\n                continue;\n        \n            if (s[i] == '(') {\n                op.push('(');\n            } else if (s[i] == ')') {\n                while (op.top() != '(') {\n                    process_op(st, op.top());\n                    op.pop();\n                }\n                op.pop();\n            } else if (is_op(s[i])) {\n                char cur_op = s[i];\n                while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) {\n                    process_op(st, op.top());\n                    op.pop();\n                }\n                op.push(cur_op);\n            } else {\n                int number = 0;\n                while (i < (int)s.size() && isalnum(s[i]))\n                    number = number * 10 + s[i++] - '0';\n                --i;\n                st.push(number);\n            }\n        }\n\n        while (!op.empty()) {\n            process_op(st, op.top());\n            op.pop();\n        }\n        return st.top();\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Thus we learned how to calculate the value of an expression in $O(n)$, at the same time we implicitly used the reverse Polish notation.\n    By slightly modifying the above implementation it is also possible to obtain the expression in reverse Polish notation in an explicit form.\n\n    ## Unary operators\n\n    Now suppose that the expression also contains **unary** operators (operators that take one argument).\n    The unary plus and unary minus are common examples of such operators.\n\n    One of the differences in this case, is that we need to determine whether the current operator is a unary or a binary one.\n\n    You can notice, that before an unary operator, there always is another operator or an opening parenthesis, or nothing at all (if it is at the very beginning of the expression).\n    On the contrary before a binary operator there will always be an operand (number) or a closing parenthesis.\n    Thus it is easy to flag whether the next operator can be unary or not. \n\n    Additionally we need to execute a unary and a binary operator differently.\n    And we need to chose the priority of a unary operator higher than all of the binary operators.\n\n    In addition it should be noted, that some unary operators (e.g. unary plus and unary minus) are actually **right-associative**.\n\n    ## Right-associativity\n\n    Right-associative means, that whenever the priorities are equal, the operators must be evaluated from right to left.\n\n    As noted above, unary operators are usually right-associative.\n    Another example for an right-associative operator is the exponentiation operator ($a \\wedge b \\wedge c$ is usually perceived as $a^{b^c}$ and not as $(a^b)^c$).\n\n    What difference do we need to make in order to correctly handle right-associative operators?\n    It turns out that the changes are very minimal.\n    The only difference will be, if the priorities are equal we will postpone the execution of the right-associative operation.\n\n    The only line that needs to be replaced is\n    ```cpp\n    while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op))\n    ```\n    with\n    ```cpp\n    while (!op.empty() && (\n            (left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) ||\n            (!left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) > priority(cur_op))\n        ))\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Expression parsing\n    Part: 2/2\n    ```\n    where `left_assoc` is a function that decides if an operator is left_associative or not.\n\n    Here is an implementation for the binary operators $+$ $-$ $*$ $/$ and the unary  operators $+$ and $-$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=expression_parsing_unary}\n    bool delim(char c) {\n        return c == ' ';\n    }\n\n    bool is_op(char c) {\n        return c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*' || c == '/';\n    }\n\n    bool is_unary(char c) {\n        return c == '+' || c=='-';\n    }\n\n    int priority (char op) {\n        if (op < 0) // unary operator\n            return 3;\n        if (op == '+' || op == '-')\n            return 1;\n        if (op == '*' || op == '/')\n            return 2;\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    void process_op(stack<int>& st, char op) {\n        if (op < 0) {\n            int l = st.top(); st.pop();\n            switch (-op) {\n                case '+': st.push(l); break;\n                case '-': st.push(-l); break;\n            }\n        } else {\n            int r = st.top(); st.pop();\n            int l = st.top(); st.pop();\n            switch (op) {\n                case '+': st.push(l + r); break;\n                case '-': st.push(l -

Finally, we will return the computed result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Initialize two stacks: one for numbers and one for operators\n   Initialize a variable to keep track of the current number and the last operator\n   Iterate through each character in the string:\n       If the character is a digit:\n           Build the current number\n       If the character is an operator (+ or -):\n           Push the current number onto the number stack\n           Update the last operator\n       If the character is an opening parenthesis:\n           Push the last operator onto the operator stack\n           Reset the last operator\n       If the character is a closing parenthesis:\n           Evaluate the expression until the last opening parenthesis\n       Ignore spaces\n   After the loop, push the last number onto the number stack\n   Evaluate any remaining operations in the operator stack\n   Return the top of the number stack as the result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:\n        # Initialize stacks for numbers and operators\n        num_stack = []\n        op_stack = []\n        current_num = 0\n        last_op = '+'\n        \n        # Iterate through each character in the string\n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            char = s[i]\n            \n            # If the character is a digit, build the current number\n            if char.isdigit():\n                current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)\n            \n            # If the character is an operator or we are at the end of the string\n            if char in '+-' or i == len(s) - 1:\n                if last_op == '+':\n                    num_stack.append(current_num)\n                elif last_op == '-':\n                    num_stack.append(-current_num)\n                \n                # Update the last operator and reset current number\n                last_op = char\n                current_num = 0\n            \n            # If the character is an opening parenthesis, push the last operator\n            if char == '(':\n                op_stack.append(last_op)\n                last_op = '+'\n            \n            # If the character is a closing parenthesis, evaluate the expression\n            if char == ')':\n                if last_op == '+':\n                    num_stack.append(current_num)\n                elif last_op == '-':\n                    num_stack.append(-current_num)\n                \n                # Reset current number and get the last operator\n                current_num = 0\n                last_op = op_stack.pop()\n        \n        # Push the last number onto the stack\n        if last_op == '+':\n            num_stack.append(current_num)\n        elif last_op == '-':\n            num_stack.append(-current_num)\n        \n        # Return the sum of the numbers in the stack\n        return sum(num_stack)\n```"

        "content": "In this task, I implemented a basic calculator to evaluate simple mathematical expressions given as strings. The core concepts involved parsing the string to handle numbers, operators, and parentheses while maintaining the correct order of operations. A stack-based approach was utilized to manage the numbers and operators effectively.\n\nThe solution involved iterating through each character in the string, building multi-digit numbers, and applying operations based on the last encountered operator. Parentheses were handled by pushing the current operator onto a stack and resetting it when encountering an opening parenthesis. Upon reaching a closing parenthesis, the expression within was evaluated before continuing.\n\nThe final implementation successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was effective. The key takeaway was the importance of managing state (current number and last operator) and using stacks to handle nested expressions correctly. The solution is efficient and adheres to the constraints of not using any built-in evaluation functions. \n\nHere is the final code snippet for reference:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:\n        num_stack = []\n        op_stack = []\n        current_num = 0\n        last_op = '+'\n        \n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            char = s[i]\n            if char.isdigit():\n                current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)\n            if char in '+-' or i == len(s) - 1:\n                if last_op == '+':\n                    num_stack.append(current_num)\n                elif last_op == '-':\n                    num_stack.append(-current_num)\n                last_op = char\n                current_num = 0\n            if char == '(':\n                op_stack.append(last_op)\n                last_op = '+'\n            if char == ')':\n                if last_op == '+':\n                    num_stack.append(current_num)\n                elif last_op == '-':\n                    num_stack.append(-current_num)\n                current_num = 0\n                last_op = op_stack.pop()\n        \n        if last_op == '+':\n            num_stack.append(current_num)\n        elif last_op == '-':\n            num_stack.append(-current_num)\n        \n        return sum(num_stack)\n```"

        "content": "The official solution provides a clear and efficient approach to evaluating a mathematical expression. Here are the key insights and steps that stand out:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The solution initializes variables for the result (`res`), the current number (`num`), the current sign (`sign`), and a stack (`stk`) to handle nested expressions.\n\n2. **Character Iteration**: The solution iterates through each character in the string. It effectively distinguishes between digits, operators, and parentheses:\n   - For digits, it builds the current number by multiplying the existing number by 10 and adding the new digit.\n   - For operators (`+` and `-`), it updates the result based on the current sign and resets the number.\n   - For opening parentheses, it saves the current result and sign onto the stack, then resets them for the new sub-expression.\n   - For closing parentheses, it finalizes the current number and result, then combines them with the values popped from the stack.\n\n3. **Final Calculation**: After the loop, if there is any remaining number, it adds it to the result. This ensures that the last number is accounted for.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The solution operates in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input string, as it processes each character exactly once. The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case due to the stack used for parentheses.\n\nIn contrast, my initial approach was similar but lacked clarity in handling the parentheses and the final result calculation. The official solution's use of a single stack to manage both the result and the sign during nested expressions is more elegant and reduces complexity. Additionally, the handling of the last number after the loop ensures that no values are missed, which I had implemented but could have been clearer in the context of parentheses. Overall, the official solution is more concise and effectively manages the state transitions throughout the evaluation process."

        "content": "\n[description]\nThis function evaluates a mathematical expression represented as a string, handling addition, subtraction, and parentheses. It uses two stacks to keep track of numbers and operators while iterating through each character in the input string. When a digit is encountered, it builds the current number, and when an operator or the end of the string is reached, it processes the current number based on the last operator. The function also manages nested expressions by using a stack to store the last operator when encountering opening parentheses and retrieves it upon closing parentheses. Finally, it sums all the numbers in the stack and returns the result as an integer. The implementation ensures correct order of operations and handles whitespace effectively.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to evaluate mathematical expressions programmatically, such as in building a calculator application, parsing expressions in compilers, or implementing features in software that require arithmetic evaluations. It can also be applied in educational tools that help users understand mathematical operations and order of operations, especially when dealing with parentheses and multiple operators."
