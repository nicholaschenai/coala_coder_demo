    "summary": "In this task, I implemented a basic calculator to evaluate simple mathematical expressions given as strings. The core concepts involved parsing the string to handle numbers, operators, and parentheses while maintaining the correct order of operations. A stack-based approach was utilized to manage the numbers and operators effectively.\n\nThe solution involved iterating through each character in the string, building multi-digit numbers, and applying operations based on the last encountered operator. Parentheses were handled by pushing the current operator onto a stack and resetting it when encountering an opening parenthesis. Upon reaching a closing parenthesis, the expression within was evaluated before continuing.\n\nThe final implementation successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was effective. The key takeaway was the importance of managing state (current number and last operator) and using stacks to handle nested expressions correctly. The solution is efficient and adheres to the constraints of not using any built-in evaluation functions. \n\nHere is the final code snippet for reference:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:\n        num_stack = []\n        op_stack = []\n        current_num = 0\n        last_op = '+'\n        \n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            char = s[i]\n            if char.isdigit():\n                current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)\n            if char in '+-' or i == len(s) - 1:\n                if last_op == '+':\n                    num_stack.append(current_num)\n                elif last_op == '-':\n                    num_stack.append(-current_num)\n                last_op = char\n                current_num = 0\n            if char == '(':\n                op_stack.append(last_op)\n                last_op = '+'\n            if char == ')':\n                if last_op == '+':\n                    num_stack.append(current_num)\n                elif last_op == '-':\n                    num_stack.append(-current_num)\n                current_num = 0\n                last_op = op_stack.pop()\n        \n        if last_op == '+':\n            num_stack.append(current_num)\n        elif last_op == '-':\n            num_stack.append(-current_num)\n        \n        return sum(num_stack)\n```",
    "reflection": "The official solution provides a clear and efficient approach to evaluating a mathematical expression. Here are the key insights and steps that stand out:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The solution initializes variables for the result (`res`), the current number (`num`), the current sign (`sign`), and a stack (`stk`) to handle nested expressions.\n\n2. **Character Iteration**: The solution iterates through each character in the string. It effectively distinguishes between digits, operators, and parentheses:\n   - For digits, it builds the current number by multiplying the existing number by 10 and adding the new digit.\n   - For operators (`+` and `-`), it updates the result based on the current sign and resets the number.\n   - For opening parentheses, it saves the current result and sign onto the stack, then resets them for the new sub-expression.\n   - For closing parentheses, it finalizes the current number and result, then combines them with the values popped from the stack.\n\n3. **Final Calculation**: After the loop, if there is any remaining number, it adds it to the result. This ensures that the last number is accounted for.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The solution operates in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input string, as it processes each character exactly once. The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case due to the stack used for parentheses.\n\nIn contrast, my initial approach was similar but lacked clarity in handling the parentheses and the final result calculation. The official solution's use of a single stack to manage both the result and the sign during nested expressions is more elegant and reduces complexity. Additionally, the handling of the last number after the loop ensures that no values are missed, which I had implemented but could have been clearer in the context of parentheses. Overall, the official solution is more concise and effectively manages the state transitions throughout the evaluation process.",
    "desc": "\n[description]\nThis function evaluates a mathematical expression represented as a string, handling addition, subtraction, and parentheses. It uses two stacks to keep track of numbers and operators while iterating through each character in the input string. When a digit is encountered, it builds the current number, and when an operator or the end of the string is reached, it processes the current number based on the last operator. The function also manages nested expressions by using a stack to store the last operator when encountering opening parentheses and retrieves it upon closing parentheses. Finally, it sums all the numbers in the stack and returns the result as an integer. The implementation ensures correct order of operations and handles whitespace effectively.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to evaluate mathematical expressions programmatically, such as in building a calculator application, parsing expressions in compilers, or implementing features in software that require arithmetic evaluations. It can also be applied in educational tools that help users understand mathematical operations and order of operations, especially when dealing with parentheses and multiple operators."
