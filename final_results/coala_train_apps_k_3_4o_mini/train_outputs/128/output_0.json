    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a basic calculator that can evaluate a mathematical expression given as a string. The expression can include numbers, the plus (+) and minus (-) operators, parentheses for grouping, and spaces that should be ignored. The goal is to compute the result of the expression without using any built-in evaluation functions.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach. We will iterate through the characters of the string, handling numbers, operators, and parentheses appropriately. When we encounter a number, we will build it (since it can be more than one digit). When we encounter an operator, we will check the precedence and apply any necessary calculations. Parentheses will require us to evaluate the expression inside them first. Finally, we will return the computed result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Initialize two stacks: one for numbers and one for operators\n   Initialize a variable to keep track of the current number and the last operator\n   Iterate through each character in the string:\n       If the character is a digit:\n           Build the current number\n       If the character is an operator (+ or -):\n           Push the current number onto the number stack\n           Update the last operator\n       If the character is an opening parenthesis:\n           Push the last operator onto the operator stack\n           Reset the last operator\n       If the character is a closing parenthesis:\n           Evaluate the expression until the last opening parenthesis\n       Ignore spaces\n   After the loop, push the last number onto the number stack\n   Evaluate any remaining operations in the operator stack\n   Return the top of the number stack as the result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:\n        # Initialize stacks for numbers and operators\n        num_stack = []\n        op_stack = []\n        current_num = 0\n        last_op = '+'\n        \n        # Iterate through each character in the string\n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            char = s[i]\n            \n            # If the character is a digit, build the current number\n            if char.isdigit():\n                current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)\n            \n            # If the character is an operator or we are at the end of the string\n            if char in '+-' or i == len(s) - 1:\n                if last_op == '+':\n                    num_stack.append(current_num)\n                elif last_op == '-':\n                    num_stack.append(-current_num)\n                \n                # Update the last operator and reset current number\n                last_op = char\n                current_num = 0\n            \n            # If the character is an opening parenthesis, push the last operator\n            if char == '(':\n                op_stack.append(last_op)\n                last_op = '+'\n            \n            # If the character is a closing parenthesis, evaluate the expression\n            if char == ')':\n                if last_op == '+':\n                    num_stack.append(current_num)\n                elif last_op == '-':\n                    num_stack.append(-current_num)\n                \n                # Reset current number and get the last operator\n                current_num = 0\n                last_op = op_stack.pop()\n        \n        # Push the last number onto the stack\n        if last_op == '+':\n            num_stack.append(current_num)\n        elif last_op == '-':\n            num_stack.append(-current_num)\n        \n        # Return the sum of the numbers in the stack\n        return sum(num_stack)\n```",
