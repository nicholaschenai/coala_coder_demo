    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The problem involves calculating the mean of the maximum scores of students in a class after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve. The questions are assigned to specific ranges of students based on their roll numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   - Start by initializing a list of scores for all students, each set to 10.\n   - For each question, determine the range of students it affects (from roll number `i` to `j`).\n   - For each student in that range, multiply their current score by the complexity `k` of the question.\n   - After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores by summing them up and dividing by the number of students, then take the floor of that value.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function calculate_mean_scores(T):\n       for each test case:\n           read N, M\n           initialize scores list with 10 for each student\n           for each question:\n               read i, j, k\n               for student in range(i to j):\n                   scores[student] *= k\n           total_score = sum(scores)\n           mean_score = floor(total_score / N)\n           print(mean_score\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef calculate_mean_scores(T):\n    for _ in range(T):\n        # Read number of students and number of questions\n        N, M = map(int, input().split())\n        \n        # Initialize scores for each student to 10\n        scores = [10] * N\n        \n        # Process each question\n        for _ in range(M):\n            i, j, k = map(int, input().split())\n            # Update scores for the range of students affected by the question\n            for student in range(i - 1, j):  # Convert to 0-based index\n                scores[student] *= k\n        \n        # Calculate the total score and mean score\n        total_score = sum(scores)\n        mean_score = total_score // N  # Use integer division for floor value\n        \n        # Output the mean score\n        print(mean_score)\n\n# Read number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ncalculate_mean_scores(T)\n```",
