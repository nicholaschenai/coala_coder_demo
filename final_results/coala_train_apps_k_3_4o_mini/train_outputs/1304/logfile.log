## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.
However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:
123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \, 2 \, 3 \quad    1 \, 3 \, 2 \quad     2 \, 1 \, 3 \quad     2 \, 3 \, 1 \quad     3 \, 1 \, 2 \quad     3 \, 2 \, 1 
The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, â€¦, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$.

-----Output:-----
The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$.
- $1 \leq K \leq 10$.

-----Sample input-----
3 2
3 1 2
2 3 1

-----Sample output-----
3 2 1
3 1 2

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to find the next permutation in lexicographic order for a given list of permutations of numbers from 1 to N. We will be provided with multiple permutations, and for each one, we need to compute and print the next permutation.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the next permutation, we can follow these steps:
   - Identify the longest suffix that is in descending order. This means we need to find the rightmost pair of elements where the first element is less than the second.
   - If such a pair is found, we will swap the first element of this pair with the smallest element in the suffix that is larger than it.
   - Finally, we reverse the suffix to get the next permutation in lexicographic order.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function next_permutation(arr):
       find the largest index i such that arr[i] < arr[i + 1]
       if no such index exists, reverse arr and return
       find the largest index j greater than i such that arr[i] < arr[j]
       swap arr[i] and arr[j]
       reverse the sequence from arr[i + 1] to the end of arr

   read N and K
   for each permutation:
       call next_permutation on the permutation
       print the result
   ```

        i -= 1
    
    # Step 2: If no such index exists, the permutation is the last one
    if i == -1:
        arr.reverse()  # Reverse to get the first permutation

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of finding a permutation \( P \) such that \( f(P) = K \), I learned several key concepts and strategies. The function \( f(P) \) is defined as the sum of the maximums of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \( f(P) \) for a descending permutation is \( N \times (N - 1) \). This insight was crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a given \( K \).

    Initially, my approach to calculating the maximum value and adjusting the permutation was flawed. I incorrectly calculated the maximum possible value and did not implement a clear strategy for adjusting the permutation to reach \( K \). The adjustment logic involved swapping adjacent elements, but it lacked a systematic approach to ensure that the desired \( K \) could be achieved.

    After revising the code, I implemented a more structured approach: I calculated the maximum value correctly, checked if \( K \) was feasible, and then constructed a descending permutation. I iteratively adjusted the permutation by swapping elements while recalculating \( f(P) \) until it matched \( K \) or determined it was impossible.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def find_permutation(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, input().split())
            max_value = N * (N - 1)
        
            if K > max_value:
                print(-1)
                continue
        
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_f = sum(max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1]) for i in range(N - 1))
        
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_f > K:
                    if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:
                        permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                        current_f = sum(max(permutation[j], permutation[j + 1]) for j in range(N - 1))
            
                if current_f == K:
                    break
        
            if current_f == K:
                print(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
            else:
                print(-1)

    T = int(input())
    find_permutation(T)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of clearly understanding the problem constraints and systematically approaching adjustments in permutations.

    [Task]:
        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
        You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
        Note f([1]) = 0.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
        - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
        Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

        -----Constraints-----
        - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 40

        Output:
        -1
        1 2
        5 4 3 2 1

        -----Explanation-----
        Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
        Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
        Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.
    [/Task]

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem and the previous solution step-by-step to identify the issues.

        ### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
        The goal is to find a permutation \( P \) of numbers from 1 to \( N \) such that the function \( f(P) \) equals \( K \). The function \( f(P) \) is defined as the sum of the maximums of adjacent pairs in the permutation.

        ### Step 2: Analyzing the Previous Code
        1. **Maximum Calculation**: The maximum possible value of \( f(P) \) was calculated incorrectly. The correct maximum value for \( f(P) \) for a descending permutation is \( N \times (N - 1) \) because each adjacent pair contributes the maximum of the two numbers, which in a descending order is always the first number.
  
        2. **Adjustment Logic**: The logic to adjust the permutation to achieve \( f(P) = K \) was flawed. The code attempted to swap adjacent elements without a clear strategy to reach the desired \( K \). 

        3. **Output**: The output was not correctly generating valid permutations for cases where \( K \) was achievable.

        ### Step 3: Correcting the Approach
        1. **Calculate Maximum \( f(P) \)**: The maximum value of \( f(P) \) for a descending permutation should be calculated as \( N \times (N - 1) \).

        2. **Feasibility Check**: If \( K \) is greater than this maximum, output -1.

        3. **Constructing the Permutation**: Start with a descending permutation and adjust it to reach \( K \) by strategically swapping elements.

        4. **Output the Result**: Ensure the output is formatted correctly.

        ### Revised Code
        Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the code that implements the above logic:

        ```python
        def find_permutation(T):
            for _ in range(T):
                # Read N and K for each test case
                N, K = map(int, input().split())
        
                # Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P)
                max_value = N * (N - 1)  # This is the maximum f(P) for a descending permutation
        
                # If K is greater than the maximum possible value, output -1
                if K > max_value:
                    print(-1)
                    continue
        
                # Create a descending permutation from N to 1
                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        
                # Calculate the current value of f(P)
                current_f = sum(max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1]) for i in range(N - 1))
        
                # Adjust the permutation to achieve f(P) = K
                for i in range(N - 1):
                    if current_f > K:
                        # We can swap elements to reduce the max values
                        # Swap the current element with the next one if it helps
                        if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:
                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                            current_f = sum(max(permutation[j], permutation[j + 1]) for j in range(N - 1))
            
                    if current_f == K:
                        break
        
                # If we reach the desired K, print the resulting permutation
                if current_f == K:
                    print(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
                else:
                    print(-1)

        # Read number of test cases
        T = int(input())
        find_permutation(T)
        ```

        ### Key Changes Made:
        - Correctly calculated the maximum possible value of \( f(P) \).
        - Adjusted the logic to ensure that we can reach \( K \) by considering the structure of the permutation.
        - Ensured that the output is correctly formatted and valid permutations are generated.

        This revised code should now correctly handle the test cases provided.

        Based on the insights gained from the previous attempts and the understanding of the problem, here is the corrected solution for finding a permutation \( P \) such that \( f(P) = K \).

        ### Key Points to Address:
        1. **Maximum Calculation**: The maximum value of \( f(P) \) for a descending permutation is \( N \times (N - 1) \).
        2. **Feasibility Check**: If \( K \) is greater than this maximum, output -1.
        3. **Constructing the Permutation**: Start with a descending permutation and adjust it to reach \( K \) by strategically swapping elements.

        ### Final Python Code
        Hereâ€™s the corrected code that implements the above logic:

        ```python
        def find_permutation(T):
            for _ in range(T):
                # Read N and K for each test case
                N, K = map(int, input().split())
        
                # Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P)
                max_value = N * (N - 1)  # This is the maximum f(P) for a descending permutation
        
                # If K is greater than the maximum possible value, output -1
                if K > max_value:
                    print(-1)
                    continue
        
                # Create a descending permutation from N to 1
                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        
                # Calculate the current value of f(P)
                current_f = sum(max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1]) for i in range(N - 1))
        
                # Adjust the permutation to achieve f(P) = K
                for i in range(N - 1):
                    if current_f > K:
                        # We can swap elements to reduce the max values
                        # Swap the current element with the next one if it helps
                        if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:
                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                            current_f = sum(max(permutation[j], permutation[j + 1]) for j in range(N - 1))
            
                    if current_f == K:
                        break
        
                # If we reach the desired K, print the resulting permutation
                if current_f == K:
                    print(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
                else:
                    print(-1)

        # Read number of test cases
        T = int(input())
        find_permutation(T)
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code:
        1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads \( N \) and \( K \).
        2. **Maximum Calculation**: It calculates the maximum possible value of \( f(P) \) for a descending permutation.
        3. **Feasibility Check**: If \( K \) is greater than the maximum possible value, it prints -1.
        4. **Permutation Creation**: It initializes a descending permutation from \( N \) to 1.
        5. **Current \( f(P) \) Calculation**: It calculates the current value of \( f(P) \) based on the permutation.
        6. **Adjustment Loop**: It attempts to adjust the permutation to match \( K \) by swapping adjacent elements if it helps reduce the current \( f(P) \).
        7. **Output**: Finally, it prints the resulting permutation if \( f(P) \) matches \( K \), otherwise it prints -1.

        This code should now correctly handle the test cases provided and produce the expected results.

    [Task]:
        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
        You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
        Note f([1]) = 0.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
        - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
        Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

        -----Constraints-----
        - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 40
        - 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
        - Sum of N over all test cases in each file â‰¤ 106
        - 0 â‰¤ K â‰¤ 2 * 1010

        -----Example-----
        Input:
        3
        4 12
        2 2
        5 14

        Output:
        -1
        1 2
        5 4 3 2 1

        -----Explanation-----
        Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
        Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
        Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

        It seems there was a syntax error in the code provided. Let's correct that and ensure the logic is implemented properly. The goal is to create a permutation that satisfies the condition for the function f(P) = K.

                # Read N and K for each test case

                # Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P)
                max_value = (N * (N + 1)) // 2 - N  # This is the sum of the first N-1 numbers
        
                # If K is greater than the maximum possible value, output -1
                if K > max_value:
                    print(-1)
                    continue
        
                # Create a descending permutation from N to 1
                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
        
                # Calculate the current value of f(P)
                current_f = sum(max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1]) for i in range(N - 1))
        
                # Adjust the permutation to achieve f(P) = K
                for i in range(N - 1):
                    if current_f > K:
                        # We can swap elements to reduce the max values
                        # Swap the current element with the next one if it helps
                        if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:
                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                            current_f = sum(max(permutation[j], permutation[j + 1]) for j in range(N - 1))
            
                    if current_f == K:
                        break

        # Read number of test cases
        T = int(input())
        find_permutation(T)
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code:
        1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads N and K.
        2. **Maximum Calculation**: It calculates the maximum possible value of f(P) for a descending permutation.
        3. **Check Feasibility**: If K is greater than the maximum possible value, it prints -1.
        4. **Permutation Creation**: It initializes a descending permutation from N to 1.
        5. **Current f(P) Calculation**: It calculates the current value of f(P) based on the permutation.
        6. **Adjustment Loop**: It attempts to adjust the permutation to match K by swapping adjacent elements if it helps reduce the current f(P).
        7. **Output**: Finally, it prints the resulting permutation.

        This code should now run without syntax errors and fulfill the problem requirements.

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] 1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
   The task is to find the next permutation of a given sequence of numbers from 1 to N in lexicographic order. Given a permutation, we need to determine what the next permutation would be. If the given permutation is the last one in the order, we should return the first permutation (which is sorted in ascending order).

2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
   To find the next permutation:
   - Identify the longest suffix that is non-increasing (i.e., find the rightmost pair where the first number is less than the second).
   - If such a pair is found, swap the first number of this pair with the smallest number in the suffix that is larger than it.
   - Finally, reverse the suffix to get the next permutation in lexicographic order.
   - If no such pair exists, the permutation is the last one, and we should return the first permutation.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.
However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:
123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \, 2 \, 3 \quad    1 \, 3 \, 2 \quad     2 \, 1 \, 3 \quad     2 \, 3 \, 1 \quad     3 \, 1 \, 2 \quad     3 \, 2 \, 1 
The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, â€¦, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$.

-----Output:-----
The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$.
- $1 \leq K \leq 10$.

-----Sample input-----
3 2
3 1 2

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] The task involved generating the next permutation of a sequence of numbers in lexicographic order. The core concept tested was understanding how to manipulate permutations efficiently, particularly identifying the rightmost ascent in the sequence and performing swaps and reversals to achieve the next permutation.

The solution strategy involved:
1. Finding the longest non-increasing suffix of the permutation.
2. Identifying the pivot element just before this suffix.
3. Swapping this pivot with the smallest element in the suffix that is larger than it.
4. Reversing the suffix to get the next permutation.

The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output requirements. The code utilized a helper function for reversing the suffix, which kept the main function clean and focused on the permutation logic.

The final code snippet is as follows:

```python
def reverse(arr, start):
    end = len(arr) - 1
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        start += 1
        end -= 1

def next_permutation(permutation):
    n = len(permutation)
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0 and permutation[i] >= permutation[i + 1]:
        i -= 1
    if i < 0:
        return sorted(permutation)  # Return the first permutation
    
    j = n - 1
    while permutation[j] <= permutation[i]:
        j -= 1
    
    permutation[i], permutation[j] = permutation[j], permutation[i]
    reverse(permutation, i + 1)
    return permutation

for _ in range(K):
    permutation = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = next_permutation(permutation)
    print(" ".join(map(str, result)))
```

This experience reinforced the importance of understanding permutation generation algorithms and their applications in combinatorial problems.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.
However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:
123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \, 2 \, 3 \quad    1 \, 3 \, 2 \quad     2 \, 1 \, 3 \quad     2 \, 3 \, 1 \quad     3 \, 1 \, 2 \quad     3 \, 2 \, 1 
The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, â€¦, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$.

-----Output:-----
The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$.
- $1 \leq K \leq 10$.

-----Sample input-----
3 2
3 1 2
2 3 1

-----Sample output-----
3 2 1
3 1 2

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [prompt] 1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
   The task is to find the next permutation of a given sequence of numbers from 1 to N in lexicographic order. Given a permutation, we need to determine what the next permutation would be. If the given permutation is the last one in the order, we should return the first permutation (which is sorted in ascending order).

2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
   To find the next permutation:
   - Identify the longest suffix that is non-increasing (i.e., find the rightmost pair where the first number is less than the second).
   - If such a pair is found, swap the first number of this pair with the smallest number in the suffix that is larger than it.
   - Finally, reverse the suffix to get the next permutation in lexicographic order.
   - If no such pair exists, the permutation is the last one, and we should return the first permutation.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function next_permutation(permutation):
       n = length of permutation
       i = n - 2
       while i >= 0 and permutation[i] >= permutation[i + 1]:
           i -= 1
       if i < 0:
           return sorted(permutation)  # Return the first permutation
       
       j = n - 1
       while permutation[j] <= permutation[i]:
           j -= 1

            break
    
    print(*arr)

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] The official solution effectively implements the algorithm to find the next permutation in lexicographic order. Here are the key insights and steps that can be distilled from it:

1. **Input Handling**: The official solution uses helper functions to read input efficiently. This is a good practice for competitive programming as it simplifies the main logic and improves readability.

2. **Finding the Pivot**: The solution iterates through the array in reverse to find the first index `i` where the current element is less than the next element (`arr[i] < arr[i+1]`). This identifies the point where the order can be changed to create the next permutation.

3. **Finding the Successor**: Once the pivot is found, the solution looks for the smallest element in the suffix (the part of the array after the pivot) that is larger than `arr[i]`. This is done using a simple loop, which ensures that the next permutation is the smallest possible.

4. **Swapping and Sorting**: After identifying the correct element to swap with the pivot, the solution performs the swap and then sorts the suffix to ensure it is in the lowest possible order. This guarantees that the next permutation is indeed the next in lexicographic order.

5. **Output**: Finally, the solution prints the resulting permutation in a space-separated format.

### Reflection on My Attempt:
- My approach was similar in logic but lacked clarity in handling the suffix sorting. I used a reverse function which, while correct, was less efficient than directly sorting the suffix after the swap.
- The official solution's method of finding the successor and directly modifying the array in place is more efficient and straightforward.
- I also noticed that my input handling was less efficient compared to the official solution, which uses dedicated functions for reading input.

Overall, the official solution is a good reference for efficiently implementing the next permutation algorithm, particularly in terms of clarity and performance. It emphasizes the importance of clear input handling and efficient array manipulation, which are crucial in competitive programming contexts.
