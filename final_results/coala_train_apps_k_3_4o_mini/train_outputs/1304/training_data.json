    "summary": "The task involved generating the next permutation of a sequence of numbers in lexicographic order. The core concept tested was understanding how to manipulate permutations efficiently, particularly identifying the rightmost ascent in the sequence and performing swaps and reversals to achieve the next permutation.\n\nThe solution strategy involved:\n1. Finding the longest non-increasing suffix of the permutation.\n2. Identifying the pivot element just before this suffix.\n3. Swapping this pivot with the smallest element in the suffix that is larger than it.\n4. Reversing the suffix to get the next permutation.\n\nThe implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output requirements. The code utilized a helper function for reversing the suffix, which kept the main function clean and focused on the permutation logic.\n\nThe final code snippet is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef reverse(arr, start):\n    end = len(arr) - 1\n    while start < end:\n        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]\n        start += 1\n        end -= 1\n\ndef next_permutation(permutation):\n    n = len(permutation)\n    i = n - 2\n    while i >= 0 and permutation[i] >= permutation[i + 1]:\n        i -= 1\n    if i < 0:\n        return sorted(permutation)  # Return the first permutation\n    \n    j = n - 1\n    while permutation[j] <= permutation[i]:\n        j -= 1\n    \n    permutation[i], permutation[j] = permutation[j], permutation[i]\n    reverse(permutation, i + 1)\n    return permutation\n\n# Read input\nN, K = map(int, input().split())\nfor _ in range(K):\n    permutation = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    result = next_permutation(permutation)\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n```\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of understanding permutation generation algorithms and their applications in combinatorial problems.",
    "reflection": "The official solution effectively implements the algorithm to find the next permutation in lexicographic order. Here are the key insights and steps that can be distilled from it:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The official solution uses helper functions to read input efficiently. This is a good practice for competitive programming as it simplifies the main logic and improves readability.\n\n2. **Finding the Pivot**: The solution iterates through the array in reverse to find the first index `i` where the current element is less than the next element (`arr[i] < arr[i+1]`). This identifies the point where the order can be changed to create the next permutation.\n\n3. **Finding the Successor**: Once the pivot is found, the solution looks for the smallest element in the suffix (the part of the array after the pivot) that is larger than `arr[i]`. This is done using a simple loop, which ensures that the next permutation is the smallest possible.\n\n4. **Swapping and Sorting**: After identifying the correct element to swap with the pivot, the solution performs the swap and then sorts the suffix to ensure it is in the lowest possible order. This guarantees that the next permutation is indeed the next in lexicographic order.\n\n5. **Output**: Finally, the solution prints the resulting permutation in a space-separated format.\n\n### Reflection on My Attempt:\n- My approach was similar in logic but lacked clarity in handling the suffix sorting. I used a reverse function which, while correct, was less efficient than directly sorting the suffix after the swap.\n- The official solution's method of finding the successor and directly modifying the array in place is more efficient and straightforward.\n- I also noticed that my input handling was less efficient compared to the official solution, which uses dedicated functions for reading input.\n\nOverall, the official solution is a good reference for efficiently implementing the next permutation algorithm, particularly in terms of clarity and performance. It emphasizes the importance of clear input handling and efficient array manipulation, which are crucial in competitive programming contexts.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: next_permutation]\nThis function generates the next lexicographical permutation of a given list of integers. It first identifies the rightmost pair of consecutive elements where the first is less than the second, indicating a point of change. If no such pair exists, it returns the sorted version of the list, representing the smallest permutation. Otherwise, it finds the smallest element to the right of this point that is larger than the identified element and swaps them. Finally, it reverses the order of the elements to the right of the original point to complete the next permutation. The function returns the modified list representing the next permutation.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to generate permutations in a systematic way, particularly in applications involving combinatorial algorithms, scheduling problems, or generating test cases for algorithms that require permutations. It can also be beneficial in competitive programming where generating the next permutation efficiently is required. Understanding how to find the next permutation can help in solving problems related to lexicographic ordering and can be applied in various fields such as data analysis, cryptography, and game development."
