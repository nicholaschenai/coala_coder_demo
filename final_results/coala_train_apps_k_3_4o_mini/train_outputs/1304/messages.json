However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, \u2026, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.\nHowever, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, \u2026, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:\n123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \\, 2 \\, 3 \\quad    1 \\, 3 \\, 2 \\quad     2 \\, 1 \\, 3 \\quad     2 \\, 3 \\, 1 \\quad     3 \\, 1 \\, 2 \\quad     3 \\, 2 \\, 1 \nThe problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, \u2026, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.\n\n-----Input:-----\nThe first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,\u2026,N$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nThe output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 1000$.\n- $1 \\leq K \\leq 10$.\n\n-----Sample input-----\n3 2\n3 1 2\n2 3 1\n\n-----Sample output-----\n3 2 1\n3 1 2\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximums of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a descending permutation is \\( N \\times (N - 1) \\). This insight was crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a given \\( K \\).\n\n    Initially, my approach to calculating the maximum value and adjusting the permutation was flawed. I incorrectly calculated the maximum possible value and did not implement a clear strategy for adjusting the permutation to reach \\( K \\). The adjustment logic involved swapping adjacent elements, but it lacked a systematic approach to ensure that the desired \\( K \\) could be achieved.\n\n    After revising the code, I implemented a more structured approach: I calculated the maximum value correctly, checked if \\( K \\) was feasible, and then constructed a descending permutation. I iteratively adjusted the permutation by swapping elements while recalculating \\( f(P) \\) until it matched \\( K \\) or determined it was impossible.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, input().split())\n            max_value = N * (N - 1)\n        \n            if K > max_value:\n                print(-1)\n                continue\n        \n            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n            current_f = sum(max(permutation[i], permutation[i + 1]) for i in range(N - 1))\n        \n            for i in range(N - 1):\n                if current_f > K:\n                    if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:\n                        permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                        current_f = sum(max(permutation[j], permutation[j + 1]) for j in range(N - 1))\n            \n                if current_f == K:\n                    break\n        \n            if current_f == K:\n                print(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n            else:\n                print(-1)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    find_permutation(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of clearly understanding the problem constraints and systematically approaching adjustments in permutations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).\n        You are given N and an integer K.

The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximums of adjacent pairs in the permutation.\n\n        ### Step 2: Analyzing the Previous Code\n        1. **Maximum Calculation**: The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) was calculated incorrectly. The correct maximum value for \\( f(P) \\) for a descending permutation is \\( N \\times (N - 1) \\) because each adjacent pair contributes the maximum of the two numbers, which in a descending order is always the first number.\n  \n        2. **Adjustment Logic**: The logic to adjust the permutation to achieve \\( f(P) = K \\) was flawed. The code attempted to swap adjacent elements without a clear strategy to reach the desired \\( K \\). \n\n        3. **Output**: The output was not correctly generating valid permutations for cases where \\( K \\) was achievable.\n\n        ### Step 3: Correcting the Approach\n        1. **Calculate Maximum \\( f(P) \\)**: The maximum value of \\( f(P) \\) for a descending permutation should be calculated as \\( N \\times (N - 1) \\).\n\n        2. **Feasibility Check**: If \\( K \\) is greater than this maximum, output -1.\n\n        3. **Constructing the Permutation**: Start with a descending permutation and adjust it to reach \\( K \\) by strategically swapping elements.\n\n        4. **Output the Result**: Ensure the output is formatted correctly.\n\n        ### Revised Code\n        Here\u2019s the corrected version of the code that implements the above logic:\n\n        ```python\n        def find_permutation(T):\n            for _ in range(T):\n                # Read N and K for each test case\n                N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        \n                # Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P)\n                max_value = N * (N -

Given a permutation, we need to determine what the next permutation would be. If the given permutation is the last one in the order, we should return the first permutation (which is sorted in ascending order).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:\n   To find the next permutation:\n   - Identify the longest suffix that is non-increasing (i.e., find the rightmost pair where the first number is less than the second).\n   - If such a pair is found, swap the first number of this pair with the smallest number in the suffix that is larger than it.\n   - Finally, reverse the suffix to get the next permutation in lexicographic order.\n   - If no such pair exists, the permutation is the last one, and we should return the first permutation.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function next_permutation(permutation):\n       n = length of permutation\n       i = n - 2\n       while i >= 0 and permutation[i] >= permutation[i + 1]:\n           i -= 1\n       if i < 0:\n           return sorted(permutation)  # Return the first permutation\n       \n       j = n - 1\n       while permutation[j] <= permutation[i]:\n           j -= 1\n       \n       swap(permutation[i], permutation[j])\n       reverse(permutation[i + 1:])\n       return permutation\n\n   read N and K\n   for each permutation in K:\n       output next_permutation(permutation)\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python Code**:\n```python\ndef reverse(arr, start):\n    end = len(arr) - 1\n    while start < end:\n        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]\n        start += 1\n        end -= 1\n\ndef next_permutation(permutation):\n    n = len(permutation)\n    i = n - 2\n    while i >= 0 and permutation[i] >= permutation[i + 1]:\n        i -= 1\n    if i < 0:\n        return sorted(permutation)  # Return the first permutation\n    \n    j = n - 1\n    while permutation[j] <= permutation[i]:\n        j -= 1\n    \n    permutation[i], permutation[j] = permutation[j], permutation[i]\n    reverse(permutation, i + 1)\n    return permutation\n\n# Read input\nN, K = map(int, input().split())\nfor _ in range(K):\n    permutation = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    result = next_permutation(permutation)\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n``` \n\nThis code reads the number of permutations and their values, processes each permutation to find the next one in lexicographic order, and prints the results."

Here are the key insights and steps that can be distilled from it:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The official solution uses helper functions to read input efficiently. This is a good practice for competitive programming as it simplifies the main logic and improves readability.\n\n2. **Finding the Pivot**: The solution iterates through the array in reverse to find the first index `i` where the current element is less than the next element (`arr[i] < arr[i+1]`). This identifies the point where the order can be changed to create the next permutation.\n\n3. **Finding the Successor**: Once the pivot is found, the solution looks for the smallest element in the suffix (the part of the array after the pivot) that is larger than `arr[i]`. This is done using a simple loop, which ensures that the next permutation is the smallest possible.\n\n4. **Swapping and Sorting**: After identifying the correct element to swap with the pivot, the solution performs the swap and then sorts the suffix to ensure it is in the lowest possible order. This guarantees that the next permutation is indeed the next in lexicographic order.\n\n5. **Output**: Finally, the solution prints the resulting permutation in a space-separated format.\n\n### Reflection on My Attempt:\n- My approach was similar in logic but lacked clarity in handling the suffix sorting. I used a reverse function which, while correct, was less efficient than directly sorting the suffix after the swap.\n- The official solution's method of finding the successor and directly modifying the array in place is more efficient and straightforward.\n- I also noticed that my input handling was less efficient compared to the official solution, which uses dedicated functions for reading input.\n\nOverall, the official solution is a good reference for efficiently implementing the next permutation algorithm, particularly in terms of clarity and performance. It emphasizes the importance of clear input handling and efficient array manipulation, which are crucial in competitive programming contexts."
