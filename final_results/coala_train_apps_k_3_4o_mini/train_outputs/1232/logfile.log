## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
AND gates and OR gates are basic components used in building digital circuits. Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.

You are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.

Now consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.

-----Input-----

The first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).

Each test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.

As stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.

Test cases are separated by a blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.


-----Output-----

For each test case you are to output a single line containing the value p for which the output of node n is 1 with probability exactly 1/2 if the inputs are independently and randomly set to value 1 with probability p. The value p should be printed with exactly 5 digits after the decimal.


-----Example-----

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a digital circuit made up of AND and OR gates, and we want to determine the probability `p` that the output of the circuit is 1 with a probability of exactly 1/2. Each input can independently be set to 1 with probability `p` or to 0 with probability `1-p`. The circuit is defined by a series of nodes, where some nodes are inputs (0) and others are gates (1 for OR, 2 for AND) that take inputs from previous nodes.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the output of the circuit based on the type of gates and their connections. We can represent the output probability of each node in terms of `p`. For an AND gate, the output is 1 if both inputs are 1, which gives us a probability of `p^2`. For an OR gate, the output is 1 if at least one input is 1, which gives us a probability of `1 - (1-p)^2`. We will compute the output probability for the final node (the output node) and set it equal to 1/2 to find the value of `p`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_probability(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read number of nodes n
           initialize a list probabilities of size n
           for i from 0 to n-1:
               read node type
               if node is input:
                   probabilities[i] = 0.5  // initial probability for input
               else if node is OR:
                   read inputs a, b
                   probabilities[i] = 1 - (1 - probabilities[a]) * (1 - probabilities[b])
               else if node is AND:
                   read inputs a, b
                   probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]
           // Now we have the output probability for the last node
           output_probability = probabilities[n-1]
           // Solve for p such that output_probability = 0.5

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
AND gates and OR gates are basic components used in building digital circuits. Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.

You are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.

Now consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.

-----Input-----

The first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).

Each test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.

As stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.

Test cases are separated by a blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.


-----Output-----

For each test case you are to output a single line containing the value p for which the output of node n is 1 with probability exactly 1/2 if the inputs are independently and randomly set to value 1 with probability p. The value p should be printed with exactly 5 digits after the decimal.

    A \key{probability} is a real number between $0$ and $1$
    that indicates how probable an event is.
    If an event is certain to happen,
    its probability is 1,
    and if an event is impossible,
    its probability is 0.
    The probability of an event is denoted $P(\cdots)$
    where the three dots describe the event.

    For example, when throwing a dice,
    the outcome is an integer between $1$ and $6$,
    and the probability of each outcome is $1/6$.
    For example, we can calculate the following probabilities:

    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item $P(\textrm{''the outcome is 4''})=1/6$
    \item $P(\textrm{''the outcome is not 6''})=5/6$
    \item $P(\textrm{''the outcome is even''})=1/2$
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Calculation}

    To calculate the probability of an event,
    we can either use combinatorics
    or simulate the process that generates the event.
    As an example, let us calculate the probability
    of drawing three cards with the same value
    from a shuffled deck of cards
    (for example, $\spadesuit 8$, $\clubsuit 8$ and $\diamondsuit 8$).

    \subsubsection*{Method 1}

    We can calculate the probability using the formula

    \[\frac{\textrm{number of desired outcomes}}{\textrm{total number of outcomes}}.\]

    In this problem, the desired outcomes are those
    in which the value of each card is the same.
    There are $13 {4 \choose 3}$ such outcomes,
    because there are $13$ possibilities for the
    value of the cards and ${4 \choose 3}$ ways to
    choose $3$ suits from $4$ possible suits.

    There are a total of ${52 \choose 3}$ outcomes,
    because we choose 3 cards from 52 cards.
    Thus, the probability of the event is

    \[\frac{13 {4 \choose 3}}{{52 \choose 3}} = \frac{1}{425}.\]

    \subsubsection*{Method 2}

    Another way to calculate the probability is
    to simulate the process that generates the event.
    In this example, we draw three cards, so the process
    consists of three steps.
    We require that each step of the process is successful.

    Drawing the first card certainly succeeds,
    because there are no restrictions.
    The second step succeeds with probability $3/51$,
    because there are 51 cards left and 3 of them
    have the same value as the first card.
    In a similar way, the third step succeeds with probability $2/50$.

    The probability that the entire process succeeds is

    \[1 \cdot \frac{3}{51} \cdot \frac{2}{50} = \frac{1}{425}.\]

    Chapter: Probability
    Section: Events
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Events}

    An event in probability theory can be represented as a set
    \[A \subset X,\]
    where $X$ contains all possible outcomes
    and $A$ is a subset of outcomes.
    For example, when drawing a dice, the outcomes are
    \[X = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}.\]
    Now, for example, the event ''the outcome is even''
    corresponds to the set
    \[A = \{2,4,6\}.\]

    Each outcome $x$ is assigned a probability $p(x)$.
    Then, the probability $P(A)$ of an event
    $A$ can be calculated as a sum
    of probabilities of outcomes using the formula
    \[P(A) = \sum_{x \in A} p(x).\]
    For example, when throwing a dice,
    $p(x)=1/6$ for each outcome $x$,
    so the probability of the event
    ''the outcome is even'' is
    \[p(2)+p(4)+p(6)=1/2.\]

    The total probability of the outcomes in $X$ must
    be 1, i.e., $P(X)=1$.

    Since the events in probability theory are sets,
    we can manipulate them using standard set operations:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item The \key{complement} $\bar A$ means
    ''$A$ does not happen''.
    For example, when throwing a dice, 
    the complement of $A=\{2,4,6\}$ is
    $\bar A = \{1,3,5\}$.
    \item The \key{union} $A \cup B$ means
    ''$A$ or $B$ happen''.
    For example, the union of
    $A=\{2,5\}$
    and $B=\{4,5,6\}$ is
    $A \cup B = \{2,4,5,6\}$.
    \item The \key{intersection} $A \cap B$ means
    ''$A$ and $B$ happen''.
    For example, the intersection of
    $A=\{2,5\}$ and $B=\{4,5,6\}$ is
    $A \cap B = \{5\}$.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Complement}

    The probability of the complement
    $\bar A$ is calculated using the formula
    \[P(\bar A)=1-P(A).\]

    Sometimes, we can solve a problem easily
    using complements by solving the opposite problem.
    For example, the probability of getting
    at least one six when throwing a dice ten times is
    \[1-(5/6)^{10}.\]

    Here $5/6$ is the probability that the outcome
    of a single throw is not six, and
    $(5/6)^{10}$ is the probability that none of
    the ten throws is a six.
    The complement of this is the answer to the problem.

    \subsubsection{Union}

    The probability of the union $A \cup B$
    is calculated using the formula
    \[P(A \cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B).\]
    For example, when throwing a dice,
    the union of the events
    \[A=\textrm{''the outcome is even''}\]
    and
    \[B=\textrm{''the outcome is less than 4''}\]
    is
    \[A \cup B=\textrm{''the outcome is even or less than 4''},\]
    and its probability is
    \[P(A \cup B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A \cap B)=1/2+1/2-1/6=5/6.\]

    If the events $A$ and $B$ are \key{disjoint}, i.e.,
    $A \cap B$ is empty,
    the probability of the event $A \cup B$ is simply

    \[P(A \cup B)=P(A)+P(B).\]

    \subsubsection{Conditional probability}

    \index{conditional probability}

    The \key{conditional probability}
    \[P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}\]
    is the probability of $A$
    assuming that $B$ happens.
    Hence, when calculating the
    probability of $A$, we only consider the outcomes
    that also belong to $B$.

    Using the previous sets,
    \[P(A | B)= 1/3,\]
    because the outcomes of $B$ are
    $\{1,2,3\}$, and one of them is even.
    This is the probability of an even outcome
    if we know that the outcome is between $1 \ldots 3$.

    \subsubsection{Intersection}

    \index{independence}

    Using conditional probability,
    the probability of the intersection
    $A \cap B$ can be calculated using the formula
    \[P(A \cap B)=P(A)P(B|A).\]
    Events $A$ and $B$ are \key{independent} if
    \[P(A|B)=P(A) \hspace{10px}\textrm{and}\hspace{10px} P(B|A)=P(B),\]
    which means that the fact that $B$ happens does not
    change the probability of $A$, and vice versa.
    In this case, the probability of the intersection is
    \[P(A \cap B)=P(A)P(B).\]
    For example, when drawing a card from a deck, the events
    \[A = \textrm{''the suit is clubs''}\]
    and
    \[B = \textrm{''the value is four''}\]
    are independent. Hence the event
    \[A \cap B = \textrm{''the card is the four of clubs''}\]
    happens with probability
    \[P(A \cap B)=P(A)P(B)=1/4 \cdot 1/13 = 1/52.\]

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... for multiple test cases. Initially, I attempted to derive a formula for the series but mistakenly used an incorrect formula that did not correspond to the series, leading to incorrect outputs.

    Upon analyzing the series, I identified that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, which led to the realization that the N'th term could be computed as the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares. The correct formula for the N'th term is:
    - T(N) = (N-1) * N * (2(N-1) + 1) / 6

    This formula was derived from the known formula for the sum of squares. After implementing this corrected formula, the code produced the expected results for all test cases.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(N):
        if N == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1) // 6

    def main():
        T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N
            result = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            print(result)  # Output the result

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring that the derived formulas are correct before implementation.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
AND gates and OR gates are basic components used in building digital circuits. Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.

You are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.

Now consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.

-----Input-----

The first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).

Each test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.

As stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.

Test cases are separated by a blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.


-----Output-----

For each test case you are to output a single line containing the value p for which the output of node n is 1 with probability exactly 1/2 if the inputs are independently and randomly set to value 1 with probability p. The value p should be printed with exactly 5 digits after the decimal.


-----Example-----
Input:

4

1 1 2

3
0

2 1 2

5

0.70711

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [generation text] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify potential issues that could lead to runtime errors or incorrect outputs.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The input is read as a single block and split into lines. The code attempts to handle blank lines, but it may not be robust enough to handle all cases, especially if there are multiple blank lines or if the input format is slightly different than expected.

2. **Node Representation**:
   - The nodes are stored in a list called `nodes`, where each node can be an input, OR gate, or AND gate. The representation seems correct, but we need to ensure that the indices used for accessing the nodes are accurate.

3. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The `calculate_probability` function recursively computes the probability of a node outputting 1 based on its type (input, OR, AND). The logic for OR and AND gates appears correct, but we need to ensure that the inputs to these gates are correctly indexed.

4. **Binary Search for Probability**:
   - The `find_p_for_half_probability` function uses binary search to find the probability \( p \) such that the output of the last node is 1 with a probability of exactly 1/2. The condition for the binary search seems appropriate, but we need to ensure that the precision is sufficient to avoid infinite loops or excessive iterations.

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The results are formatted to five decimal places, which is correct. However, we need to ensure that the output is printed correctly after all test cases are processed.

### Potential Issues Identified:
- The handling of blank lines may not be robust enough.
- The indexing of nodes in the `calculate_probability` function may lead to incorrect results if not handled properly.
- The binary search may not converge correctly if the precision is not set appropriately.

### Steps to Fix:
1. Improve the input handling to ensure that blank lines are correctly managed.
2. Double-check the indexing of nodes in the `calculate_probability` function to ensure that we are accessing the correct nodes.
3. Ensure that the binary search has a sufficient precision and does not lead to infinite loops.
4. Add print statements for debugging if necessary to trace the flow of data and identify where it might be going wrong.

Now, let's implement these fixes in the code. 

```python
def calculate_probability(node, p, nodes):
    # If the node is an input, return the probability p
    if nodes[node][0] == 0:
        return p
    # If the node is an OR gate
    elif nodes[node][0] == 1:
        return 1 - (1 - calculate_probability(nodes[node][1] - 1, p, nodes)) * (1 - calculate_probability(nodes[node][2] - 1, p, nodes))
    # If the node is an AND gate
    elif nodes[node][0] == 2:
        return calculate_probability(nodes[node][1] - 1, p, nodes) * calculate_probability(nodes[node][2] - 1, p, nodes)

def find_p_for_half_probability(n, nodes):
    low = 0.0
    high = 1.0
    epsilon = 1e-7  # Precision for binary search
    while (high - low) > epsilon:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        if calculate_probability(n - 1, mid, nodes) < 0.5:  # n-1 because nodes are 0-indexed
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid
    return mid

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().strip().split('\n')
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index].strip())  # Read the number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        while index < len(data) and data[index].strip() == '':
            index += 1  # Skip blank lines
        if index >= len(data):
            break
        n = int(data[index].strip())  # Read number of nodes
        index += 1
        
        nodes = []
        for i in range(n):
            line = list(map(int, data[index].strip().split()))
            nodes.append(line)  # Store node information
            index += 1
        
        p = find_p_for_half_probability(n, nodes)  # Calculate p for the last node
        results.append(f"{p:.5f}")  # Format the result to 5 decimal places
    
    print("\n".join(results))  # Output all results

main()
``` 

### Key Changes Made:
- Adjusted the indexing in the `calculate_probability` function to account for the 1-based indexing of the input.
- Improved the handling of blank lines in the input processing loop.
- Ensured that the output is printed correctly after processing all test cases. 

This should resolve the issues and allow the code to pass all tests.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
AND gates and OR gates are basic components used in building digital circuits. Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.

You are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.

Now consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.

-----Input-----

The first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).

Each test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.

As stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.

Test cases are separated by a blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.


-----Output-----

For each test case you are to output a single line containing the value p for which the output of node n is 1 with probability exactly 1/2 if the inputs are independently and randomly set to value 1 with probability p. The value p should be printed with exactly 5 digits after the decimal.


-----Example-----
Input:

1 1 2

1. Restate the problem in plain English

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine the probability \( p \) such that the output of a digital circuit composed of AND and OR gates is 1 with a probability of exactly 1/2. The circuit is defined by a series of nodes, where each node can either be an input (0) or a gate (1 for OR, 2 for AND) that takes inputs from previous nodes.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we will represent the circuit as a directed graph where nodes are either inputs or gates. We will recursively calculate the probability of each gate outputting 1 based on the probabilities of its input nodes. The goal is to find the value of \( p \) such that the final output node (the last node) has a probability of 1/2. This can be achieved using a binary search approach to find the correct value of \( p \).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```

The condition for the binary search seems appropriate, but we need to ensure that the precision is sufficient to avoid infinite loops or excessive iterations.

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The results are formatted to five decimal places, which is correct. However, we need to ensure that the output is printed correctly after all test cases are processed.

### Potential Issues Identified:
- The handling of blank lines may not be robust enough.
- The indexing of nodes in the `calculate_probability` function may lead to incorrect results if not handled properly.
- The binary search may not converge correctly if the precision is not set appropriately.

### Steps to Fix:
1. Improve the input handling to ensure that blank lines are correctly managed.
2. Double-check the indexing of nodes in the `calculate_probability` function to ensure that we are accessing the correct nodes.
3. Ensure that the binary search has a sufficient precision and does not lead to infinite loops.
4. Add print statements for debugging if necessary to trace the flow of data and identify where it might be going wrong.

Now, let's implement these fixes in the code. 

```python
def calculate_probability(node, p, nodes):
    # If the node is an input, return the probability p
    if nodes[node][0] == 0:
        return p
    # If the node is an OR gate
    elif nodes[node][0] == 1:
        return 1 - (1 - calculate_probability(nodes[node][1] - 1, p, nodes)) * (1 - calculate_probability(nodes[node][2] - 1, p, nodes))
    # If the node is an AND gate
    elif nodes[node][0] == 2:
        return calculate_probability(nodes[node][1] - 1, p, nodes) * calculate_probability(nodes[node][2] - 1, p, nodes)

def find_p_for_half_probability(n, nodes):
    low = 0.0
    high = 1.0
    epsilon = 1e-7  # Precision for binary search
    while (high - low) > epsilon:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        if calculate_probability(n - 1, mid, nodes) < 0.5:  # n-1 because nodes are 0-indexed
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid
    return mid

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().strip().split('\n')
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index].strip())  # Read the number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        while index < len(data) and data[index].strip() == '':
            index += 1  # Skip blank lines
        if index >= len(data):
            break
        n = int(data[index].strip())  # Read number of nodes
        index += 1
        
        nodes = []
        for i in range(n):
            line = list(map(int, data[index].strip().split()))
            nodes.append(line)  # Store node information
            index += 1
        
        p = find_p_for_half_probability(n, nodes)  # Calculate p for the last node
        results.append(f"{p:.5f}")  # Format the result to 5 decimal places
    
    print("\n".join(results))  # Output all results

main()
``` 

### Key Changes Made:
- Adjusted the indexing in the `calculate_probability` function to account for the 1-based indexing of the input.
- Improved the handling of blank lines in the input processing loop.
- Ensured that the output is printed correctly after processing all test cases. 

This should resolve the issues and allow the code to pass all tests.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... for multiple test cases. Initially, I attempted to derive a formula for the series but mistakenly used an incorrect formula that did not correspond to the series, leading to incorrect outputs.

    Upon analyzing the series, I identified that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, which led to the realization that the N'th term could be computed as the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares. The correct formula for the N'th term is:
    - T(N) = (N-1) * N * (2(N-1) + 1) / 6

    This formula was derived from the known formula for the sum of squares. After implementing this corrected formula, the code produced the expected results for all test cases.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(N):
        if N == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1) // 6

    def main():
        T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N
            result = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            print(result)  # Output the result

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring that the derived formulas are correct before implementation.

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to calculate the mean of maximum scores for students after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve, which are assigned to specific ranges of students based on their roll numbers.

    The core concept tested here was the efficient updating of scores for a range of students based on multiple queries. The approach involved initializing a list of scores, iterating through each question, and updating the scores for the specified range. The final mean score was calculated by summing the scores and dividing by the number of students, using integer division to obtain the floor value.

    The solution was implemented successfully without any errors, and the provided code snippet effectively handled the input and output requirements. The key takeaway was the importance of managing score updates efficiently, especially given the constraints where both the number of students and questions could be large (up to 100,000). The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_mean_scores(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, M = map(int, input().split())
            scores = [10] * N
            for _ in range(M):
                i, j, k = map(int, input().split())
                for student in range(i - 1, j):
                    scores[student] *= k
            total_score = sum(scores)
            mean_score = total_score // N
            print(mean_score)

    T = int(input())
    calculate_mean_scores(T)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements and efficiently managing data updates in programming challenges.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to calculate the maximum strength of an army formed by PokÃ©mon strengths using an alternating sum formula. The alternating sum is defined as \( a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \ldots \). The challenge was to maximize this sum based on the original arrangement of strengths without any swap operations.

    Initially, I misunderstood the requirement and attempted to calculate the alternating sum based on the sorted strengths rather than the original order. This led to incorrect outputs, as the alternating sum should reflect the optimal selection of strengths from the original list. The correct approach involved sorting the strengths in descending order and then applying the alternating sum formula based on the sorted list.

    The final solution correctly implemented this logic by sorting the strengths and calculating the maximum alternating sum by adding strengths at even indices and subtracting those at odd indices. However, despite these corrections, the solution still failed to produce the expected results, indicating a deeper misunderstanding of how to select strengths optimally.

    Key Takeaways:
    - The alternating sum needs to be calculated based on the optimal selection of strengths, not just their positions.
    - Sorting the strengths in descending order is essential for maximizing the alternating sum.
    - Careful attention to the problem requirements is crucial to avoid logical errors in implementation.

    Final Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def calculate_max_strength(t):
        for _ in range(t):
            n, q = map(int, input().split())
            strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))
            strengths.sort(reverse=True)
            max_strength = 0
            for index in range(n):
                if index % 2 == 0:
                    max_strength += strengths[index]
                else:
                    max_strength -= strengths[index]
            print(max_strength)

    t = int(input())
    calculate_max_strength(t)
    ``` 

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and the need for careful implementation to achieve the desired results.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
AND gates and OR gates are basic components used in building digital circuits. Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.

You are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.

Now consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.

-----Input-----

The first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).

Each test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.

As stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.

Test cases are separated by a blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.


-----Output-----

For each test case you are to output a single line containing the value p for which the output of node n is 1 with probability exactly 1/2 if the inputs are independently and randomly set to value 1 with probability p. The value p should be printed with exactly 5 digits after the decimal.


-----Example-----
Input:

1 1 2

2 1 2

5

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We need to determine the probability \( p \) such that the output of a digital circuit composed of AND and OR gates is 1 with a probability of exactly 1/2. The circuit is defined by a series of nodes, where each node can either be an input (0) or a gate (1 for OR, 2 for AND) that takes inputs from previous nodes.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we will represent the circuit as a directed graph where nodes are either inputs or gates. We will recursively calculate the probability of each gate outputting 1 based on the probabilities of its input nodes. The goal is to find the value of \( p \) such that the final output node (the last node) has a probability of 1/2. This can be achieved using a binary search approach to find the correct value of \( p \).

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify potential issues that could lead to runtime errors or incorrect outputs.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The input is read as a single block and split into lines. The code attempts to handle blank lines, but it may not be robust enough to handle all cases, especially if there are multiple blank lines or if the input format is slightly different than expected.

2. **Node Representation**:
   - The nodes are stored in a list called `nodes`, where each node can be an input, OR gate, or AND gate. The representation seems correct, but we need to ensure that the indices used for accessing the nodes are accurate.

3. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The `calculate_probability` function recursively computes the probability of a node outputting 1 based on its type (input, OR, AND). The logic for OR and AND gates appears correct, but we need to ensure that the inputs to these gates are correctly indexed.

4. **Binary Search for Probability**:
   - The `find_p_for_half_probability` function uses binary search to find the probability \( p \) such that the output of the last node is 1 with a probability of exactly 1/2. The condition for the binary search seems appropriate, but we need to ensure that the precision is sufficient to avoid infinite loops or excessive iterations.

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The results are formatted to five decimal places, which is correct. However, we need to ensure that the output is printed correctly after all test cases are processed.

### Potential Issues Identified:
- The handling of blank lines may not be robust enough.
- The indexing of nodes in the `calculate_probability` function may lead to incorrect results if not handled properly.
- The binary search may not converge correctly if the precision is not set appropriately.

### Steps to Fix:
1. Improve the input handling to ensure that blank lines are correctly managed.
2. Double-check the indexing of nodes in the `calculate_probability` function to ensure that we are accessing the correct nodes.
3. Ensure that the binary search has a sufficient precision and does not lead to infinite loops.
4. Add print statements for debugging if necessary to trace the flow of data and identify where it might be going wrong.

Now, let's implement these fixes in the code. 

```python
def calculate_probability(node, p, nodes):
    # If the node is an input, return the probability p
    if nodes[node][0] == 0:
        return p
    # If the node is an OR gate
    elif nodes[node][0] == 1:
        return 1 - (1 - calculate_probability(nodes[node][1] - 1, p, nodes)) * (1 - calculate_probability(nodes[node][2] - 1, p, nodes))
    # If the node is an AND gate
    elif nodes[node][0] == 2:
        return calculate_probability(nodes[node][1] - 1, p, nodes) * calculate_probability(nodes[node][2] - 1, p, nodes)

def find_p_for_half_probability(n, nodes):
    low = 0.0
    high = 1.0
    epsilon = 1e-7  # Precision for binary search
    while (high - low) > epsilon:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        if calculate_probability(n - 1, mid, nodes) < 0.5:  # n-1 because nodes are 0-indexed
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid
    return mid

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().strip().split('\n')
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index].strip())  # Read the number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        while index < len(data) and data[index].strip() == '':
            index += 1  # Skip blank lines
        if index >= len(data):
            break
        n = int(data[index].strip())  # Read number of nodes
        index += 1
        
        nodes = []
        for i in range(n):
            line = list(map(int, data[index].strip().split()))
            nodes.append(line)  # Store node information

        results.append(f"{p:.5f}")  # Format the result to 5 decimal places
    
    print("\n".join(results))  # Output all results

main()
``` 

### Key Changes Made:
- Adjusted the indexing in the `calculate_probability` function to account for the 1-based indexing of the input.
- Improved the handling of blank lines in the input processing loop.
- Ensured that the output is printed correctly after processing all test cases. 

This should resolve the issues and allow the code to pass all tests.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [generation text] In solving the problem of determining the probability \( p \) for a digital circuit composed of AND and OR gates, I learned the importance of careful input handling and accurate indexing when working with node representations. The circuit is defined by nodes that can either be inputs or gates, and the output probability needs to be calculated recursively based on the type of gate.

Initially, the code had issues with handling blank lines in the input, which could lead to incorrect parsing of test cases. Additionally, the indexing for accessing the nodes was off, as the input format used 1-based indexing while Python uses 0-based indexing. This discrepancy caused incorrect calculations in the probability function.

The solution involved implementing a binary search to find the value of \( p \) such that the output of the last node is 1 with a probability of exactly 1/2. The final code correctly computes the probabilities and formats the output to five decimal places.

Key code snippets:
```python
def calculate_probability(node, p, nodes):
    if nodes[node][0] == 0:
        return p
    elif nodes[node][0] == 1:
        return 1 - (1 - calculate_probability(nodes[node][1] - 1, p, nodes)) * (1 - calculate_probability(nodes[node][2] - 1, p, nodes))
    elif nodes[node][0] == 2:
        return calculate_probability(nodes[node][1] - 1, p, nodes) * calculate_probability(nodes[node][2] - 1, p, nodes)

def find_p_for_half_probability(n, nodes):
    low = 0.0
    high = 1.0
    epsilon = 1e-7
    while (high - low) > epsilon:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        if calculate_probability(n - 1, mid, nodes) < 0.5:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid
    return mid
```

Overall, this experience reinforced the need for meticulous attention to detail in both input processing and algorithm implementation, especially when dealing with recursive functions and probability calculations.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
AND gates and OR gates are basic components used in building digital circuits. Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.

You are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.

Now consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.

-----Input-----

The first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).

Each test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.

As stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.

Test cases are separated by a blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.


-----Output-----

For each test case you are to output a single line containing the value p for which the output of node n is 1 with probability exactly 1/2 if the inputs are independently and randomly set to value 1 with probability p. The value p should be printed with exactly 5 digits after the decimal.


-----Example-----
Input:

1 1 2

2 1 2

5

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify potential issues that could lead to runtime errors or incorrect outputs.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The input is read as a single block and split into lines. The code attempts to handle blank lines, but it may not be robust enough to handle all cases, especially if there are multiple blank lines or if the input format is slightly different than expected.

2. **Node Representation**:
   - The nodes are stored in a list called `nodes`, where each node can be an input, OR gate, or AND gate. The representation seems correct, but we need to ensure that the indices used for accessing the nodes are accurate.

3. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The `calculate_probability` function recursively computes the probability of a node outputting 1 based on its type (input, OR, AND). The logic for OR and AND gates appears correct, but we need to ensure that the inputs to these gates are correctly indexed.

4. **Binary Search for Probability**:
   - The `find_p_for_half_probability` function uses binary search to find the probability \( p \) such that the output of the last node is 1 with a probability of exactly 1/2. The condition for the binary search seems appropriate, but we need to ensure that the precision is sufficient to avoid infinite loops or excessive iterations.

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The results are formatted to five decimal places, which is correct. However, we need to ensure that the output is printed correctly after all test cases are processed.

### Potential Issues Identified:
- The handling of blank lines may not be robust enough.
- The indexing of nodes in the `calculate_probability` function may lead to incorrect results if not handled properly.
- The binary search may not converge correctly if the precision is not set appropriately.

### Steps to Fix:
1. Improve the input handling to ensure that blank lines are correctly managed.
2. Double-check the indexing of nodes in the `calculate_probability` function to ensure that we are accessing the correct nodes.
3. Ensure that the binary search has a sufficient precision and does not lead to infinite loops.
4. Add print statements for debugging if necessary to trace the flow of data and identify where it might be going wrong.

Now, let's implement these fixes in the code. 

```python
def calculate_probability(node, p, nodes):
    # If the node is an input, return the probability p
    if nodes[node][0] == 0:
        return p
    # If the node is an OR gate
    elif nodes[node][0] == 1:
        return 1 - (1 - calculate_probability(nodes[node][1] - 1, p, nodes)) * (1 - calculate_probability(nodes[node][2] - 1, p, nodes))
    # If the node is an AND gate
    elif nodes[node][0] == 2:
        return calculate_probability(nodes[node][1] - 1, p, nodes) * calculate_probability(nodes[node][2] - 1, p, nodes)

def find_p_for_half_probability(n, nodes):
    low = 0.0
    high = 1.0
    epsilon = 1e-7  # Precision for binary search
    while (high - low) > epsilon:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        if calculate_probability(n - 1, mid, nodes) < 0.5:  # n-1 because nodes are 0-indexed
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid
    return mid

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().strip().split('\n')
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index].strip())  # Read the number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        while index < len(data) and data[index].strip() == '':
            index += 1  # Skip blank lines
        if index >= len(data):
            break
        n = int(data[index].strip())  # Read number of nodes
        index += 1
        
        nodes = []
        for i in range(n):
            line = list(map(int, data[index].strip().split()))
            nodes.append(line)  # Store node information
            index += 1
        
        p = find_p_for_half_probability(n, nodes)  # Calculate p for the last node
        results.append(f"{p:.5f}")  # Format the result to 5 decimal places
    
    print("\n".join(results))  # Output all results

main()
``` 

### Key Changes Made:
- Adjusted the indexing in the `calculate_probability` function to account for the 1-based indexing of the input.
- Improved the handling of blank lines in the input processing loop.
- Ensured that the output is printed correctly after processing all test cases. 

This should resolve the issues and allow the code to pass all tests.

INFO - [Task id] 1232 [generation text] In reflecting on my attempts to solve the problem, I found that while my solution was functional and passed the provided test cases, it could be improved in terms of clarity and efficiency. The official solution employs a more structured approach using a class to represent nodes, which enhances readability and encapsulation of node properties.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:
1. **Node Representation**: The official solution uses a `node` class to encapsulate the properties of each node (value and its inputs). This makes it easier to manage and understand the relationships between nodes.

2. **Recursive Probability Calculation**: The `finder` function recursively calculates the probability of a node outputting 1 based on its type (input, OR, AND). This is similar to my approach but is more elegantly implemented with the class structure.

3. **Binary Search for Probability**: The official solution uses a binary search to find the probability \( p \) that results in the output being 1 with a probability of exactly 1/2. The precision is set to a very small value (`1e-9`), which ensures that the search converges accurately.

4. **Input Handling**: The official solution handles input parsing and node creation in a straightforward manner, ensuring that the node list is built correctly before performing calculations.

### Comparison with My Approach:
- My solution was functional but lacked the clarity provided by the class-based structure. The use of a list to store nodes made it less intuitive to manage node properties.
- The recursive function in my solution was similar in logic but could benefit from the encapsulation that the official solution provides.
- The official solution's handling of input and node creation is more streamlined, which could reduce potential errors in indexing and node management.

### Conclusion:
Overall, while my solution worked, the official solution demonstrates a more effective way to structure the problem using object-oriented principles. In future problems, I should consider using classes to encapsulate related data and functionality, which can lead to clearer and more maintainable code.

[Problem]
    AND gates and OR gates are basic components used in building digital circuits. Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.

    You are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.

    Now consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.

    -----Input-----

    The first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).

    Each test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.

    As stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.

    Test cases are separated by a blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.


    -----Output-----

    For each test case you are to output a single line containing the value p for which the output of node n is 1 with probability exactly 1/2 if the inputs are independently and randomly set to value 1 with probability p. The value p should be printed with exactly 5 digits after the decimal.


    -----Example-----
    Input:

    4
