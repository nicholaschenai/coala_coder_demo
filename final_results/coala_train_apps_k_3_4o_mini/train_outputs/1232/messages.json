Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.\n\nYou are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.\n\nNow consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).\n\nEach test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.\n\nAs stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.\n\nTest cases are separated by a blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case you are to output a single line containing the value p for which the output of node n is 1 with probability exactly 1/2 if the inputs are independently and randomly set to value 1 with probability p. The value p should be printed with exactly 5 digits after the decimal.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n\n4\n\n1\n0\n\n3\n0\n0\n1 1 2\n\n3\n0\n0\n2 1 2\n\n5\n0\n0\n0\n2 1 2\n1 3 4\n\nOutput:\n\n0.50000\n0.29289\n0.70711\n0.40303\n\n-----Temporary Stuff-----\n\nA horizontal rule follows.\n\n***\n\nHere's a definition list (with `definitionLists` option):\n\napples\n: Good for making applesauce.\noranges\n: Citrus!\ntomatoes\n: There's no \"e\" in tomatoe.\n\n#PRACTICE\n- This must be done\n[http:codechef.com/users/dpraveen](http:codechef.com/users/dpraveen)\n\n(0.8944272\u22120.44721360.4472136\u22120.8944272)(10005)(0.89442720.4472136\u22120.4472136\u22120.8944272)(10005)\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \n0.8944272 & 0.4472136\\\\\n-0.4472136 & -0.8944272\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \n10 & 0\\\\ \n0 & 5\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Each input can independently be set to 1 with probability `p` or to 0 with probability `1-p`.

We can represent the output probability of each node in terms of `p`. For an AND gate, the output is 1 if both inputs are 1, which gives us a probability of `p^2`. For an OR gate, the output is 1 if at least one input is 1, which gives us a probability of `1 - (1-p)^2`.

\\key{probability} is a real number between $0$ and $1$\n    that indicates how probable an event is.\n    If an event is certain to happen,\n    its probability is 1,\n    and if an event is impossible,\n    its probability is 0.\n    The probability of an event is denoted $P(\\cdots)$\n    where the three dots describe the event.\n\n    For example, when throwing a dice,\n    the outcome is an integer between $1$ and $6$,\n    and the probability of each outcome is $1/6$.\n    For example, we can calculate the following probabilities:\n\n    \\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]\n    \\item $P(\\textrm{''the outcome is 4''})=1/6$\n    \\item $P(\\textrm{''the outcome is not 6''})=5/6$\n    \\item $P(\\textrm{''the outcome is even''})=1/2$\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    \\section{Calculation}\n\n    To calculate the probability of an event,\n    we can either use combinatorics\n    or simulate the process that generates the event.\n    As an example, let us calculate the probability\n    of drawing three cards with the same value\n    from a shuffled deck of cards\n    (for example, $\\spadesuit 8$, $\\clubsuit 8$ and $\\diamondsuit 8$).\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Method 1}\n\n    We can calculate the probability using the formula\n\n    \\[\\frac{\\textrm{number of desired outcomes}}{\\textrm{total number of outcomes}}.\\]\n\n    In this problem, the desired outcomes are those\n    in which the value of each card is the same.\n    There are $13 {4 \\choose 3}$ such outcomes,\n    because there are $13$ possibilities for the\n    value of the cards and ${4 \\choose 3}$ ways to\n    choose $3$ suits from $4$ possible suits.\n\n    There are a total of ${52 \\choose 3}$ outcomes,\n    because we choose 3 cards from 52 cards.\n    Thus, the probability of the event is\n\n    \\[\\frac{13 {4 \\choose 3}}{{52 \\choose 3}} = \\frac{1}{425}.\\]\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Method 2}\n\n    Another way to calculate the probability is\n    to simulate the process that generates the event.\n    In this example, we draw three cards, so the process\n    consists of three steps.\n    We require that each step of the process is successful.\n\n    Drawing the first card certainly succeeds,\n    because there are no restrictions.\n    The second step succeeds with probability $3/51$,\n    because there are 51 cards left and 3 of them\n    have the same value as the first card.\n    In a similar way, the third step succeeds with probability $2/50$.\n\n    The probability that the entire process succeeds is\n\n    \\[1 \\cdot \\frac{3}{51} \\cdot \\frac{2}{50} = \\frac{1}{425}.\\]\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Probability\n    Section: Events\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Events}\n\n    An event in probability theory can be represented as a set\n    \\[A \\subset X,\\]\n    where $X$ contains all possible outcomes\n    and $A$ is a subset of outcomes.\n    For example, when drawing a dice, the outcomes are\n    \\[X = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}.\\]\n    Now, for example, the event ''the outcome is even''\n    corresponds to the set\n    \\[A = \\{2,4,6\\}.\\]\n\n    Each outcome $x$ is assigned a probability $p(x)$.\n    Then, the probability $P(A)$ of an event\n    $A$ can be calculated as a sum\n    of probabilities of outcomes using the formula\n    \\[P(A) = \\sum_{x \\in A} p(x).\\]\n    For example, when throwing a dice,\n    $p(x)=1/6$ for each outcome $x$,\n    so the probability of the event\n    ''the outcome is even'' is\n    \\[p(2)+p(4)+p(6)=1/2.\\]\n\n    The total probability of the outcomes in $X$ must\n    be 1, i.e., $P(X)=1$.\n\n    Since the events in probability theory are sets,\n    we can manipulate them using standard set operations:\n\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The \\key{complement} $\\bar A$ means\n    ''$A$ does not happen''.\n    For example, when throwing a dice, \n    the complement of $A=\\{2,4,6\\}$ is\n    $\\bar A = \\{1,3,5\\}$.\n    \\item The \\key{union} $A \\cup B$ means\n    ''$A$ or $B$ happen''.\n    For example, the union of\n    $A=\\{2,5\\}$\n    and $B=\\{4,5,6\\}$ is\n    $A \\cup B = \\{2,4,5,6\\}$.\n    \\item The \\key{intersection} $A \\cap B$ means\n    ''$A$ and $B$ happen''.\n    For example, the intersection of\n    $A=\\{2,5\\}$ and $B=\\{4,5,6\\}$ is\n    $A \\cap B = \\{5\\}$.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    \\subsubsection{Complement}\n\n    The probability of the complement\n    $\\bar A$ is calculated using the formula\n    \\[P(\\bar A)=1-P(A).\\]\n\n    Sometimes, we can solve a problem easily\n    using complements by solving the opposite problem.\n    For example, the probability of getting\n    at least one six when throwing a dice ten times is\n    \\[1-(5/6)^{10}.\\]\n\n    Here $5/6$ is the probability that the outcome\n    of a single throw is not six, and\n    $(5/6)^{10}$ is the probability that none of\n    the ten throws is a six.\n    The complement of this is the answer to the problem.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Union}\n\n    The probability of the union $A \\cup B$\n    is calculated using the formula\n    \\[P(A \\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \\cap B).\\]\n    For example, when throwing a dice,\n    the union of the events\n    \\[A=\\textrm{''the outcome is even''}\\]\n    and\n    \\[B=\\textrm{''the outcome is less than 4''}\\]\n    is\n    \\[A \\cup B=\\textrm{''the outcome is even or less than 4''},\\]\n    and its probability is\n    \\[P(A \\cup B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A \\cap B)=1/2+1/2-1/6=5/6.\\]\n\n    If the events $A$ and $B$ are \\key{disjoint}, i.e.,\n    $A \\cap B$ is empty,\n    the probability of the event $A \\cup B$ is simply\n\n    \\[P(A \\cup B)=P(A)+P(B).\\]\n\n    \\subsubsection{Conditional probability}\n\n    \\index{conditional probability}\n\n    The \\key{conditional probability}\n    \\[P(A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\\]\n    is the probability of $A$\n    assuming that $B$ happens.\n    Hence, when calculating the\n    probability of $A$, we only consider the outcomes\n    that also belong to $B$.\n\n    Using the previous sets,\n    \\[P(A | B)= 1/3,\\]\n    because the outcomes of $B$ are\n    $\\{1,2,3\\}$, and one of them is even.\n    This is the probability of an even outcome\n    if we know that the outcome is between $1 \\ldots 3$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Intersection}\n\n    \\index{independence}\n\n    Using conditional probability,\n    the probability of the intersection\n    $A \\cap B$ can be calculated using the formula\n    \\[P(A \\cap B)=P(A)P(B|A).\\]\n    Events $A$ and $B$ are \\key{independent} if\n    \\[P(A|B)=P(A) \\hspace{10px}\\textrm{and}\\hspace{10px} P(B|A)=P(B),\\]\n    which means that the fact that $B$ happens does not\n    change the probability of $A$, and vice versa.\n    In this case, the probability of the intersection is\n    \\[P(A \\cap B)=P(A)P(B).\\]\n    For example, when drawing a card from a deck, the events\n    \\[A = \\textrm{''the suit is clubs''}\\]\n    and\n    \\[B = \\textrm{''the value is four''}\\]\n    are independent. Hence the event\n    \\[A \\cap B = \\textrm{''the card is the four of clubs''}\\]\n    happens with probability\n    \\[P(A \\cap B)=P(A)P(B)=1/4 \\cdot 1/13 = 1/52.\\]\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... for multiple test cases. Initially, I attempted to derive a formula for the series but mistakenly used an incorrect formula that did not correspond to the series, leading to incorrect outputs.\n\n    Upon analyzing the series, I identified that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, which led to the realization that the N'th term could be computed as the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares. The correct formula for the N'th term is:\n    - T(N) = (N-1) * N * (2(N-1) + 1) / 6\n\n    This formula was derived from the known formula for the sum of squares. After implementing this corrected formula, the code produced the expected results for all test cases.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(N):\n        if N == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1) // 6\n\n    def main():\n        T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N\n            result = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            print(result)  # Output the result\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring that the derived formulas are correct before implementation.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify potential issues that could lead to runtime errors or incorrect outputs.\n\n1. **Input Handling**:\n   - The input is read as a single block and split into lines. The code attempts to handle blank lines, but it may not be robust enough to handle all cases, especially if there are multiple blank lines or if the input format is slightly different than expected.\n\n2. **Node Representation**:\n   - The nodes are stored in a list called `nodes`, where each node can be an input, OR gate, or AND gate. The representation seems correct, but we need to ensure that the indices used for accessing the nodes are accurate.\n\n3. **Probability Calculation**:\n   - The `calculate_probability` function recursively computes the probability of a node outputting 1 based on its type (input, OR, AND). The logic for OR and AND gates appears correct, but we need to ensure that the inputs to these gates are correctly indexed.\n\n4. **Binary Search for Probability**:\n   - The `find_p_for_half_probability` function uses binary search to find the probability \\( p \\) such that the output of the last node is 1 with a probability of exactly 1/2. The condition for the binary search seems appropriate, but we need to ensure that the precision is sufficient to avoid infinite loops or excessive iterations.\n\n5. **Output Formatting**:\n   - The results are formatted to five decimal places, which is correct. However, we need to ensure that the output is printed correctly after all test cases are processed.\n\n### Potential Issues Identified:\n- The handling of blank lines may not be robust enough.\n- The indexing of nodes in the `calculate_probability` function may lead to incorrect results if not handled properly.\n- The binary search may not converge correctly if the precision is not set appropriately.\n\n### Steps to Fix:\n1. Improve the input handling to ensure that blank lines are correctly managed.\n2. Double-check the indexing of nodes in the `calculate_probability` function to ensure that we are accessing the correct nodes.\n3. Ensure that the binary search has a sufficient precision and does not lead to infinite loops.\n4. Add print statements for debugging if necessary to trace the flow of data and identify where it might be going wrong.\n\nNow, let's implement these fixes in the code. \n\n```python\ndef calculate_probability(node, p, nodes):\n    # If the node is an input, return the probability p\n    if nodes[node][0] == 0:\n        return p\n    # If the node is an OR gate\n    elif nodes[node][0] == 1:\n        return 1 - (1 - calculate_probability(nodes[node][1] - 1, p, nodes)) * (1 - calculate_probability(nodes[node][2] - 1, p, nodes))\n    # If the node is an AND gate\n    elif nodes[node][0] == 2:\n        return calculate_probability(nodes[node][1] - 1, p, nodes) * calculate_probability(nodes[node][2] - 1, p, nodes)\n\ndef find_p_for_half_probability(n, nodes):\n    low = 0.0\n    high = 1.0\n    epsilon = 1e-7  # Precision for binary search\n    while (high - low) > epsilon:\n        mid = (low + high) / 2\n        if calculate_probability(n - 1, mid, nodes) < 0.5:  # n-1 because nodes are 0-indexed\n            low = mid\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return mid\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().strip().split('\\n')\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index].strip())  # Read the number of test cases\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        while index < len(data) and data[index].strip() == '':\n            index += 1  # Skip blank lines\n        if index >= len(data):\n            break\n        n = int(data[index].strip())  # Read number of nodes\n        index += 1\n        \n        nodes = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            line = list(map(int, data[index].strip().split()))\n            nodes.append(line)  # Store node information\n            index += 1\n        \n        p = find_p_for_half_probability(n, nodes)  # Calculate p for the last node\n        results.append(f\"{p:.5f}\")  # Format the result to 5 decimal places\n    \n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))  # Output all results\n\nmain()\n``` \n\n### Key Changes Made:\n- Adjusted the indexing in the `calculate_probability` function to account for the 1-based indexing of the input.\n- Improved the handling of blank lines in the input processing loop.\n- Ensured that the output is printed correctly after processing all test cases. \n\nThis should resolve the issues and allow the code to pass all tests."

Initially, I attempted to derive a formula for the series but mistakenly used an incorrect formula that did not correspond to the series, leading to incorrect outputs.\n\n    Upon analyzing the series, I identified that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, which led to the realization that the N'th term could be computed as the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares. The correct formula for the N'th term is:\n    - T(N) = (N-1) * N * (2(N-1) + 1) / 6\n\n    This formula was derived from the known formula for the sum of squares. After implementing this corrected formula, the code produced the expected results for all test cases.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(N):\n        if N == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1) // 6\n\n    def main():\n        T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N\n            result = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            print(result)  # Output the result\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring that the derived formulas are correct before implementation.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to calculate the mean of maximum scores for students after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve, which are assigned to specific ranges of students based on their roll numbers.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the efficient updating of scores for a range of students based on multiple queries. The approach involved initializing a list of scores, iterating through each question, and updating the scores for the specified range. The final mean score was calculated by summing the scores and dividing by the number of students, using integer division to obtain the floor value.\n\n    The solution was implemented successfully without any errors, and the provided code snippet effectively handled the input and output requirements. The key takeaway was the importance of managing score updates efficiently, especially given the constraints where both the number of students and questions could be large (up to 100,000). The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_mean_scores(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, M = map(int, input().split())\n            scores = [10] * N\n            for _ in range(M):\n                i, j, k = map(int, input().split())\n                for student in range(i - 1, j):\n                    scores[student] *= k\n            total_score = sum(scores)\n            mean_score = total_score // N\n            print(mean_score)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    calculate_mean_scores(T)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements and efficiently managing data updates in programming challenges.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to calculate the maximum strength of an army formed by Pok\u00e9mon strengths using an alternating sum formula. The alternating sum is defined as \\( a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \\ldots \\). The challenge was to maximize this sum based on the original arrangement of strengths without any swap operations.\n\n    Initially, I misunderstood the requirement and attempted to calculate the alternating sum based on the sorted strengths rather than the original order. This led to incorrect outputs, as the alternating sum should reflect the optimal selection of strengths from the original list. The correct approach involved sorting the strengths in descending order and then applying the alternating sum formula based on the sorted list.\n\n    The final solution correctly implemented this logic by sorting the strengths and calculating the maximum alternating sum by adding strengths at even indices and subtracting those at odd indices. However, despite these corrections, the solution still failed to produce the expected results, indicating a deeper misunderstanding of how to select strengths optimally.\n\n    Key Takeaways:\n    - The alternating sum needs to be calculated based on the optimal selection of strengths, not just their positions.\n    - Sorting the strengths in descending order is essential for maximizing the alternating sum.\n    - Careful attention to the problem requirements is crucial to avoid logical errors in implementation.\n\n    Final Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def calculate_max_strength(t):\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n, q = map(int, input().split())\n            strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            strengths.sort(reverse=True)\n            max_strength = 0\n            for index in range(n):\n                if index % 2 == 0:\n                    max_strength += strengths[index]\n                else:\n                    max_strength -= strengths[index]\n            print(max_strength)\n\n    t = int(input())\n    calculate_max_strength(t)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and the need for careful implementation to achieve the desired results.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This is similar to my approach but is more elegantly implemented with the class structure.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Probability**: The official solution uses a binary search to find the probability \\( p \\) that results in the output being 1 with a probability of exactly 1/2. The precision is set to a very small value (`1e-9`), which ensures that the search converges accurately.\n\n4. **Input Handling**: The official solution handles input parsing and node creation in a straightforward manner, ensuring that the node list is built correctly before performing calculations.\n\n### Comparison with My Approach:\n- My solution was functional but lacked the clarity provided by the class-based structure. The use of a list to store nodes made it less intuitive to manage node properties.\n- The recursive function in my solution was similar in logic but could benefit from the encapsulation that the official solution provides.\n- The official solution's handling of input and node creation is more streamlined, which could reduce potential errors in indexing and node management.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOverall, while my solution worked, the official solution demonstrates a more effective way to structure the problem using object-oriented principles. In future problems, I should consider using classes to encapsulate related data and functionality, which can lead to clearer and more maintainable code."

It first retrieves the number of test cases and then iterates through each case to read the number of nodes and their configurations. For each test case, it calculates the probability that the last node outputs true by finding the probability value that results in a 50% chance of success. The results are formatted to five decimal places and collected for output. Finally, it prints all the results for the test cases.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios involving the design and analysis of digital circuits, particularly when determining the probability of circuit outputs based on probabilistic input values. It can be applied in fields such as computer engineering, digital logic design, and reliability engineering, where understanding the behavior of circuits under varying conditions is crucial. Additionally, this knowledge can be beneficial in algorithm development for simulations and optimizations in circuit design, as well as in educational contexts for teaching concepts related to logic gates and probability."
