You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string.\n\nFind the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.\nThe second line contains the string S.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 50\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 50\n- S will consist of uppercase English letters.\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n2\n4\nDCBA\n7\nXYZZYZZ\n\nOutput:\nADCB\nXYYZZZZ\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB\nExample case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters.

        "content": "Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Input and Output**: \n   The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line indicates the number of test cases, followed by pairs of lines where the first line of each pair gives the length of the string (which is not necessary for processing) and the second line contains the string itself. The expected output is the lexicographically smallest string for each test case, printed on a new line.\n\n2. **Identifying the Problem in the Code**:\n   - The code reads the input correctly but does not handle the output format as expected. The output should be printed for each test case, but the way the function is structured, it does not return or print the results correctly.\n   - The function `find_lexicographically_smallest_string` is designed to print the results directly, but it should be structured to collect results and print them after processing all test cases.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong**:\n   - I did not account for the fact that the first line of each test case is the length of the string, which is unnecessary for the logic but should be read and ignored.\n   - The output should be collected and printed in a single step after processing all test cases, rather than printing immediately within the loop.\n\n### Revised Plan:\n1. Read the number of test cases.\n2. For each test case, read the string and ignore the length.\n3. Implement the logic to find the lexicographically smallest string by moving one character.\n4. Collect the results and print them at the end.\n\nNow, let's implement the corrected solution:\n\n```python\ndef find_lexicographically_smallest_string(test_cases):\n    results = []  # To collect results for each test case\n    # Iterate through each test case\n    for s in test_cases:\n        smallest_string = s  # Start with the original string as the smallest\n        n = len(s)  # Get the length of the string\n        \n        # Iterate through each character in the string\n        for i in range(n):\n            char = s[i]  # Character to move\n            new_string = s[:i] + s[i+1:]  # String without the character\n            \n            # Try inserting the character at every possible position in the new string\n            for j in range(n - 1):  # n-1 because we removed one character\n                # Create a new string by inserting the character at position j\n                candidate_string = new_string[:j] + char + new_string[j:]\n                # Update smallest_string if the new candidate is smaller\n                if candidate_string < smallest_string:\n                    smallest_string = candidate_string\n        \n        results.append(smallest_string)  # Collect the smallest string for the test case\n\n    # Print all results, each on a new line\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Read number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]  # Read each test case string\nfind_lexicographically_smallest_string(test_cases)  # Call the function with the test cases\n``` \n\nThis revised code should now correctly handle the input and output as specified in the problem statement."

The key insight was to leverage the concept of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). The minimum moves needed to sort the books can be calculated as the total number of books minus the length of the LIS.\n\n    Initially, the solution focused on the logic for calculating the LIS but failed to include necessary input/output handling, which is crucial for execution in a competitive programming environment. The main issues were the lack of input reading, the absence of function invocation, and the failure to convert input strings into the appropriate data types.\n\n    The final solution involved defining a binary search function to efficiently find positions in the LIS and a main function to compute the minimum moves. The corrected code successfully handled input and output, ensuring it worked as expected in the testing environment.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final working code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def binary_search(lis, book):\n        left, right = 0, len(lis)\n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            if lis[mid] < book:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid\n        return left\n\n    def minMovesToSort(N, books):\n        lis = []\n        for book in books:\n            pos = binary_search(lis, book)\n            if pos < len(lis):\n                lis[pos] = book\n            else:\n                lis.append(book)\n        return N - len(lis)\n\n    N = int(input().strip())\n    books = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))\n    print(minMovesToSort(N, books))\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of considering input/output requirements in coding challenges and highlighted the effectiveness of using LIS to solve sorting problems efficiently.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The first line indicates the number of test cases, followed by pairs of lines where the first line of each pair gives the length of the string (which is not necessary for processing) and the second line contains the string itself. The expected output is the lexicographically smallest string for each test case, printed on a new line.\n\n2. **Identifying the Problem in the Code**:\n   - The code is reading the input correctly, but it is not handling the first line of each test case properly. The first line (length of the string) is being read but not used, which is fine, but it seems to be causing confusion in the output.\n   - The output format is expected to be a specific structure (like a list of dictionaries), but the code is simply printing the results directly.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong**:\n   - The output format is not matching the expected output. The expected output format is a list of dictionaries, but the current implementation prints strings directly.\n   - The function should return the results in the expected format rather than printing them directly.\n\n### Revised Plan:\n1.

The initial approach involved generating all permutations of the input strings and merging them based on maximum overlaps. However, this method failed to produce the correct results, as it did not account for the optimal merging of strings across different permutations.\n\n    Key issues identified included:\n    - The merging function only considered overlaps between two strings at a time, which could lead to suboptimal results when multiple strings were involved.\n    - The solution did not effectively explore the best way to concatenate strings to minimize the total length of the resulting superstring.\n\n    In subsequent attempts, I maintained the permutation generation but focused on refining the merging logic. The merging function was designed to maximize overlaps, but it still did not yield the expected results for certain test cases, such as the input `[\"alex\", \"loves\", \"leetcode\"]`, which should have produced \"leetcode\"loves\"alex\".\n\n    ### Key Takeaways:\n    - The problem requires a comprehensive approach to merging strings, considering overlaps more systematically.\n    - A more effective solution might involve dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that evaluates overlaps between all pairs of strings rather than relying solely on permutations.\n    - Future attempts should focus on optimizing the merging process to ensure that the shortest superstring is found efficiently. \n\n    ### Code Snippet for Reference:\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def shortestSuperstring(self, A: list[str]) -> str:\n            from itertools import permutations\n        \n            def merge_strings(s1, s2):\n                max_overlap = 0\n                for i in range(1, min(len(s1), len(s2)) + 1):\n                    if s1[-i:] == s2[:i]:\n                        max_overlap = i\n                return s1 + s2[max_overlap:]\n\n            shortest_string = None\n        \n            for perm in permutations(A):\n                current_string = perm[0]\n                for i in range(1, len(perm)):\n                    current_string = merge_strings(current_string, perm[i])\n                if shortest_string is None or len(current_string) < len(shortest_string):\n                    shortest_string = current_string\n        \n            return shortest_string\n    ```\n\n    This summary encapsulates the core concepts, strategies attempted, and the challenges faced during the problem-solving process.

The expected output is the lexicographically smallest string for each test case, printed in a specific format.\n\n2. **Identifying the Problem in the Code**:\n   - The code is reading the input correctly, but it is not handling the first line of each test case properly. The first line (length of the string) is being read but not used, which is fine, but it seems to be causing confusion in the output.\n   - The output format is expected to be a specific structure (like a list of dictionaries), but the code is simply printing strings directly.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong**:\n   - The output format is not matching the expected output. The expected output format is a list of dictionaries, but the current implementation prints strings directly.\n   - The function should return the results in the expected format rather than printing them directly.\n\n### Revised Plan:\n1. Read the number of test cases.\n2. For each test case, read the string and ignore the length.\n3. Implement the logic to find the lexicographically smallest string by moving one character.\n4. Collect the results in the expected format and print them at the end.\n\nNow, let's implement the corrected solution:\n\n```python\ndef find_lexicographically_smallest_string(test_cases):\n    results = []  # To collect results for each test case\n    # Iterate through each test case\n    for s in test_cases:\n        smallest_string = s  # Start with the original string as the smallest\n        n = len(s)  # Get the length of the string\n        \n        # Iterate through each character in the string\n        for i in range(n):\n            char = s[i]  # Character to move\n            new_string = s[:i] + s[i+1:]  # String without the character\n            \n            # Try inserting the character at every possible position in the new string\n            for j in range(n - 1):  # n-1 because we removed one character\n                # Create a new string by inserting the character at position j\n                candidate_string = new_string[:j] + char + new_string[j:]\n                # Update smallest_string if the new candidate is smaller\n                if candidate_string < smallest_string:\n                    smallest_string = candidate_string\n        \n        results.append({smallest_string})  # Collect the smallest string for the test case in a dictionary\n\n    # Print all results, each in the expected format\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Read number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]  # Read each test case string\nfind_lexicographically_smallest_string(test_cases)  # Call the function with the test cases\n```\n\n### Key Changes Made:\n- The results are now collected in a list of dictionaries to match the expected output format.\n- The output is printed as a single list containing dictionaries, which should align with the expected output structure.\n\nThis code should now work correctly and pass all tests as specified in the problem statement."

The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of \"abc\" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate strings and utilize loops for repeated operations. The solution successfully handled multiple test cases by reading input, processing each string, and outputting the final result after all removals.\n\n    The implemented code used a while loop to check for \"abc\" and the `replace` method to remove it. This method was efficient for the problem's constraints, as it ensured that the string was modified in place until no \"abc\" substrings were left. The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def remove_abc_pairs(test_cases):\n        for s in test_cases:\n            while \"abc\" in s:\n                s = s.replace(\"abc\", \"\", 1)\n            print(s)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]\n    remove_abc_pairs(test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding string operations and iterative processes in programming.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        The chef is having one string of English lower case alphabets only.
