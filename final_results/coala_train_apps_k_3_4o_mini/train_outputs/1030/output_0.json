    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:\n   We have an infinite binary tree where each node has a specific labeling and structure. Given two nodes `u` and `v`, we need to find out how many pairs of nodes `(w, t)` exist such that the path taken to traverse from `w` to `t` is the same as the path taken from `u` to `v`. The input consists of multiple queries, each specifying a maximum node label `n` and the two nodes `u` and `v`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:\n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Determine the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of nodes `u` and `v`. This will help us understand the path taken from `u` to `v`.\n   - Count how many nodes can be paired with `u` and `v` such that they share the same path configuration. This involves counting nodes that are in the same subtree as the LCA of `u` and `v`.\n   - The number of valid pairs `(w, t)` can be derived from the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at the LCA.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_lca(u, v):\n       while u != v:\n           if u > v:\n               u = u // 2\n           else:\n               v = v // 2\n       return u  # This is the LCA\n\n   function count_pairs(n, u, v):\n       lca = find_lca(u, v)\n       # Count nodes in the subtree rooted at LCA\n       # The number of nodes in the subtree is determined by the depth of the LCA\n       depth = 0\n       while (1 << depth) <= n:\n           depth += 1\n       # Total nodes in the subtree rooted at LCA\n       total_nodes = (1 << (depth - 1)) - 1\n       return total_nodes\n\n   function main():\n       Q = read integer from input\n       for each query:\n           n, u, v = read integers from input\n           result = count_pairs(n, u, v)\n           print(result)\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python Code**:\n```python\ndef find_lca(u, v):\n    # Function to find the lowest common ancestor of u and v\n    while u != v:\n        if u > v:\n            u = u // 2\n        else:\n            v = v // 2\n    return u  # This is the LCA\n\ndef count_pairs(n, u, v):\n    # Find the lowest common ancestor of u and v\n    lca = find_lca(u, v)\n    \n    # Count nodes in the subtree rooted at LCA\n    # The number of nodes in the subtree is determined by the depth of the LCA\n    depth = 0\n    while (1 << depth) <= n:\n        depth += 1\n    \n    # Total nodes in the subtree rooted at LCA\n    total_nodes = (1 << (depth - 1)) - 1\n    \n    # The number of valid pairs (w, t) is total_nodes\n    return total_nodes\n\ndef main():\n    Q = int(input())  # Read number of queries\n    for _ in range(Q):\n        n, u, v = map(int, input().split())  # Read n, u, v\n        result = count_pairs(n, u, v)  # Calculate result\n        print(result)  # Print result\n\nmain()\n``` \n\nThis code reads the number of queries, processes each query to find the number of valid pairs `(w, t)` based on the path configuration from `u` to `v`, and prints the results. The use of bit manipulation helps efficiently determine the depth and count of nodes in the subtree.",
