## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
There is crazy man named P29892P. He always tries to do crazy things as he thinks. One day he invented a machine and named it as ANGEN. The ANGEN is used to perform range operations. The range operation means performing operations on range values from {L..R}. At any time it performs operations on values in between L to R.
ANGEN can perform following operations
U I V - Update the value present at I  with value V
A L R - Find the sum between range L and R
M L R - Find the maximum number between L and R
m L R - Find the minimum number between L and R
S L R - Find second maximum value in between L and R
s L R - Find second mimimum value in between L and R
If it is not possible perform operation ANGEN returns ‚ÄúNA‚Äù with out quotes.
For Invalid operations ANGEN returns ‚Äú!!!‚Äù with out quotes.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 692 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a system called ANGEN that can perform various operations on a list of integers. The operations include updating a specific index with a new value, finding the sum of a range of values, finding the maximum or minimum value in a range, and finding the second maximum or second minimum value in a range. If an operation cannot be performed, we should return "NA", and for invalid operations, we should return "!!!".

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will start by reading the number of integers and the integers themselves into a list.
   - We will then read the number of queries and process each query based on its type.
   - For update operations, we will directly modify the list.
   - For sum, maximum, and minimum operations, we will compute the required values by iterating through the specified range.
   - For second maximum and second minimum operations, we will collect unique values from the range, sort them, and retrieve the second largest or second smallest.
   - We will handle invalid queries and out-of-bounds access appropriately.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function main():
       read N
       read list of integers
       read Q
       for each query in Q:
           parse query type T, L, R
           if T is 'U':
               update list at index L-1 with R
           else if T is 'A':
               calculate sum from index L-1 to R-1
           else if T is 'M':
               find maximum from index L-1 to R-1
           else if T is 'm':
               find minimum from index L-1 to R-1

           else if T is 's':
               find second minimum from index L-1 to R-1

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main challenge was to efficiently handle two types of operations on a list of hill heights: determining the final position after a series of jumps and updating the heights of a specified range. The core concept involved simulating the jumps based on the heights of the hills and ensuring that the jumps adhered to the constraints provided (i.e., jumping only to the nearest taller hill and not exceeding a distance of 100).

    The solution involved iterating through the hills for each jump operation, which worked well within the constraints. The height update operation was straightforward, directly modifying the heights in the specified range. The implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic for both operations was clearly defined.

    One key takeaway was the importance of efficiently checking conditions during the jump operation to avoid unnecessary iterations, especially given the potential size of the input (up to 100,000 hills and operations). The final implementation was effective, and the tests passed without any issues, indicating that the approach was sound. 

    The code snippet for the solution is as follows:

    ```python
    def find_final_hill(N, heights, operations):
        for operation in operations:
            if operation[0] == 1:  # Type 1 operation
                i = operation[1]
                k = operation[2]
                current_hill = i
                for jump in range(k):
                    next_hill = current_hill + 1
                    while next_hill <= N and (heights[next_hill - 1] <= heights[current_hill - 1] or next_hill - current_hill > 100):
                        next_hill += 1
                    if next_hill > N:
                        break
                    current_hill = next_hill
                print(current_hill)
            elif operation[0] == 2:  # Type 2 operation
                L = operation[1]
                R = operation[2]
                X = operation[3]
                for j in range(L - 1, R):
                    heights[j] += X

    # Read input
    N, Q = map(int, input().split())
    heights = list(map(int, input().split()))
    operations = []
    for _ in range(Q):
        operations.append(list(map(int, input().split())))

    find_final_hill(N, heights, operations)
    ```

[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to calculate the mean of maximum scores for students after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve, which are assigned to specific ranges of students based on their roll numbers.

    The core concept tested here was the efficient updating of scores for a range of students based on multiple queries. The approach involved initializing a list of scores, iterating through each question, and updating the scores for the specified range. The final mean score was calculated by summing the scores and dividing by the number of students, using integer division to obtain the floor value.

    The solution was implemented successfully without any errors, and the provided code snippet effectively handled the input and output requirements. The key takeaway was the importance of managing score updates efficiently, especially given the constraints where both the number of students and questions could be large (up to 100,000). The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_mean_scores(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, M = map(int, input().split())
            scores = [10] * N
            for _ in range(M):
                i, j, k = map(int, input().split())
                for student in range(i - 1, j):
                    scores[student] *= k
            total_score = sum(scores)
            mean_score = total_score // N
            print(mean_score)

    T = int(input())
    calculate_mean_scores(T)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements and efficiently managing data updates in programming challenges.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
           The problem requires us to calculate the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries. Each query specifies a range of indices, and we need to return the sum of the values in that range for each query. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with its own list of bills and queries.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           - For each test case, read the number of bills and the number of queries.
           - Store the values of the bills in a list.
           - For each query, extract the specified range and compute the sum of the values in that range.
           - Print the results for each query.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function process_queries(T):
               for each test case:
                   read N, Q
                   read the list of bills
                   for each query:
                       read Xi, Yi
                       calculate the sum from bills[Xi-1] to bills[Yi-1]
                       store the result
               print all results
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
        ```python
        def process_queries(T):
            for _ in range(T):
                # Read number of bills (N) and number of queries (Q)

                bills = list(map(int, input().split()))

                    # Calculate the sum from Xi to Yi (inclusive)
                    total_sum = sum(bills[Xi-1:Yi])  # Convert to 0-based index
                    results.append(total_sum)
        
                # Print all results for the current test case

INFO - [Task id] 692 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves creating a system called ANGEN that can perform various operations on a list of integers. The operations include updating a specific index with a new value, calculating the sum of values in a specified range, finding the maximum or minimum value in a range, and determining the second maximum or second minimum value in a range. If an operation cannot be performed, the system should return "NA" or "!!!" for invalid operations.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - First, read the number of integers and store them in a list.
   - Read the number of queries and process each query based on its type.
   - For update operations, change the value at the specified index.
   - For sum, maximum, and minimum operations, calculate the required values over the specified range.
   - For second maximum and second minimum operations, sort the values in the range and find the second distinct value.
   - Handle invalid operations by checking the bounds and returning appropriate messages.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function ANGEN(N, values, Q, queries):
       for each query in queries:
           if query type is 'U':
               update values at index with new value
           else if query type is 'A':
               calculate sum from L to R
           else if query type is 'M':
               find maximum from L to R
           else if query type is 'm':
               find minimum from L to R
           else if query type is 'S':
               find second maximum from L to R
           else if query type is 's':
               find second minimum from L to R
           else:

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
There is crazy man named P29892P. He always tries to do crazy things as he thinks. One day he invented a machine and named it as ANGEN. The ANGEN is used to perform range operations. The range operation means performing operations on range values from {L..R}. At any time it performs operations on values in between L to R.
ANGEN can perform following operations
U I V - Update the value present at I  with value V
A L R - Find the sum between range L and R
M L R - Find the maximum number between L and R
m L R - Find the minimum number between L and R
S L R - Find second maximum value in between L and R
s L R - Find second mimimum value in between L and R
If it is not possible perform operation ANGEN returns ‚ÄúNA‚Äù with out quotes.

INFO - [Task id] 692 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves creating a system called ANGEN that can perform various operations on a list of integers. The operations include updating a specific index with a new value, calculating the sum of values in a specified range, finding the maximum or minimum value in a range, and determining the second maximum or second minimum value in a range. If an operation cannot be performed, the system should return "NA" or "!!!" for invalid operations.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - First, read the number of integers and store them in a list.
   - Read the number of queries and process each query based on its type.
   - For update operations, change the value at the specified index.
   - For sum, maximum, and minimum operations, calculate the required values over the specified range.
   - For second maximum and second minimum operations, sort the values in the range and find the second distinct value.
   - Handle invalid operations by checking the bounds and returning appropriate messages.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function ANGEN(N, values, Q, queries):
       for each query in queries:
           if query type is 'U':
               update values at index with new value
           else if query type is 'A':
               calculate sum from L to R
           else if query type is 'M':
               find maximum from L to R
           else if query type is 'm':

INFO - [Task id] 692 [generation text] In this task, I implemented a system called ANGEN that performs various operations on a list of integers, including updates, sum calculations, and finding maximum/minimum values, as well as second maximum/minimum values. The core concepts involved understanding how to manipulate lists and handle different types of queries efficiently.

The solution required careful handling of input and output, ensuring that operations were performed within valid index ranges. I utilized helper functions to find the second maximum and second minimum values by leveraging Python's set and sorting capabilities to ensure uniqueness and order.

One key strategy that worked well was using list slicing to access subarrays for operations like sum, max, and min. However, I had to ensure that I checked for invalid ranges to avoid errors. The implementation successfully passed all tests, indicating that the logic for handling various operations was sound. 

Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of input validation and efficient data manipulation techniques in Python. The final code is structured to be clear and maintainable, with comments explaining each part of the process.

INFO - [Task id] 692 [generation text] The official solution provides a concise and efficient approach to solving the problem. Here are the key insights and steps that can be distilled from it:

1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of integers and the list of integers in a straightforward manner. It then processes each query in a loop.

2. **Query Validation**: The solution uses a string `VQ` to quickly check if the query type is valid. This is a clean way to handle invalid operations, allowing for immediate feedback with "!!!".

3. **Update Operation**: For the update operation ('U'), the solution directly modifies the list at the specified index, which is efficient and straightforward.

4. **Range Queries**: For sum ('A'), maximum ('M'), and minimum ('m') operations, the solution uses Python's built-in functions (`sum`, `max`, `min`) to compute results over the specified range. This is efficient given the constraints.

5. **Second Maximum and Minimum**: The solution handles the second maximum and minimum by first creating a sorted set of the values in the specified range. This ensures that duplicates are removed and allows for easy access to the second largest or second smallest value. The check for the length of the sorted set ensures that it returns "NA" if there aren't enough unique values.

6. **Efficiency**: The overall approach is efficient for the problem constraints, as it leverages Python's built-in capabilities for handling lists and sets, which are optimized for performance.

In summary, the official solution effectively combines input validation, direct list manipulation, and efficient range queries using built-in functions, making it both concise and performant. This approach serves as a good reference for handling similar problems involving range queries and updates in a list.

The main function is `ANGEN`.
INFO - [Task id] 692 [generation text] This function processes a series of queries on an array of integers, allowing for updates and various operations such as summing, finding maximums, minimums, and second maximums or minimums within specified ranges. It first initializes an empty list to store results and then iterates through each query, determining the type of operation to perform based on the query's content. For update operations, it modifies the specified index in the array, while for range queries, it checks the validity of the indices before performing the requested operation. If the indices are valid, it computes the result and appends it to the results list; otherwise, it appends an error message. Finally, the function returns the list of results for all queries processed. The function handles edge cases, such as invalid indices and insufficient unique values for second maximum or minimum queries.

- Focus on general patterns and situations to help connect this knowledge to new situations.
- Then, include a list of keywords that are useful for searching this problem/solution pair.

## Response format
Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```

[Problem]
    There is crazy man named P29892P. He always tries to do crazy things as he thinks. One day he invented a machine and named it as ANGEN. The ANGEN is used to perform range operations. The range operation means performing operations on range values from {L..R}. At any time it performs operations on values in between L to R.
    ANGEN can perform following operations
    U I V - Update the value present at I  with value V
    A L R - Find the sum between range L and R
    M L R - Find the maximum number between L and R
    m L R - Find the minimum number between L and R
    S L R - Find second maximum value in between L and R
    s L R - Find second mimimum value in between L and R
    If it is not possible perform operation ANGEN returns ‚ÄúNA‚Äù with out quotes.
    For Invalid operations ANGEN returns ‚Äú!!!‚Äù with out quotes.
    Now P29892P challenging his friends and you too, to build his invention with yourown code. So it's your time to defeat P29892P by implementing his invention with your own ability. Let's go and solve the problem.
