The core concept tested was understanding how to manipulate permutations efficiently, particularly identifying the rightmost ascent in the sequence and performing swaps and reversals to achieve the next permutation.\n\n    The solution strategy involved:\n    1. Finding the longest non-increasing suffix of the permutation.\n    2. Identifying the pivot element just before this suffix.\n    3. Swapping this pivot with the smallest element in the suffix that is larger than it.\n    4. Reversing the suffix to get the next permutation.\n\n    The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output requirements. The code utilized a helper function for reversing the suffix, which kept the main function clean and focused on the permutation logic.\n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def reverse(arr, start):\n        end = len(arr) - 1\n        while start < end:\n            arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]\n            start += 1\n            end -= 1\n\n    def next_permutation(permutation):\n        n = len(permutation)\n        i = n - 2\n        while i >= 0 and permutation[i] >= permutation[i + 1]:\n            i -= 1\n        if i < 0:\n            return sorted(permutation)  # Return the first permutation\n    \n        j = n - 1\n        while permutation[j] <= permutation[i]:\n            j -= 1\n    \n        permutation[i], permutation[j] = permutation[j], permutation[i]\n        reverse(permutation, i + 1)\n        return permutation\n\n    # Read input\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    for _ in range(K):\n        permutation = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        result = next_permutation(permutation)\n        print(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding permutation generation algorithms and their applications in combinatorial problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the problems created by his setters, the number of problems needed for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the available days to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging simple loops and arithmetic.\n\n    The final implementation was clean and efficient, successfully passing all provided test cases. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all edge cases (like having fewer problems than needed for a single contest) are considered. The solution was implemented without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints given. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_contests(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    max_contests(T)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of clear problem understanding and systematic solution development.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The task was to calculate the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to a given number \"N\" for multiple test cases. The solution involved identifying the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N, calculating the number of terms in the series of multiples of 10, and then using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to compute the result efficiently.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to work with arithmetic series and integer division to find multiples. The approach was straightforward: determine the largest multiple of 10, count how many multiples exist up to that point, and apply the sum formula. This method is efficient and avoids any potential issues with large numbers, as Python handles large integers natively.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, and the code was structured to read input, process each test case, and output results correctly. The key takeaway is the importance of understanding arithmetic series and how to leverage mathematical formulas for efficient computation, especially when dealing with potentially large inputs. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):\n        largest_multiple = (N // 10) * 10\n        number_of_terms = largest_multiple // 10\n        sum = (number_of_terms * (10 + largest_multiple)) // 2\n        return sum\n\n    def main():\n        T = int(input())\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)\n            print(result)\n\n    main()\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the value of mathematical insights in programming challenges, particularly in optimizing solutions for large input sizes.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

        "content": "The official solution effectively implements the merge sort algorithm to count inversions in an array, which is a well-known approach for this problem. The key insights from the official solution that are useful for future reference include:\n\n1. **Recursive Division**: The algorithm divides the array into two halves recursively until it reaches subarrays of size one. This is a fundamental aspect of the merge sort algorithm, allowing for efficient sorting and counting.\n\n2. **Counting Inversions During Merge**: While merging two sorted subarrays, the algorithm counts inversions. If an element from the right subarray is smaller than an element from the left subarray, it indicates that all remaining elements in the left subarray (from the current index to the end) are greater than the current element from the right subarray. This is where the inversion count is updated.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(N log N), which is efficient for the input constraints provided (up to 100,000 elements). This efficiency is achieved by leveraging the divide-and-conquer strategy inherent in merge sort.\n\n4. **Implementation Details**: The use of a temporary array (`temp_arr`) to store sorted elements during the merge process is crucial. This prevents overwriting the original array and allows for accurate counting of inversions.\n\n5. **Input Handling**: The solution reads multiple test cases in a straightforward manner, which is essential for competitive programming scenarios.\n\nOverall, the official solution is a solid implementation of the merge sort algorithm tailored to count inversions, and it serves as a good reference for similar problems in the future. The approach is clear, efficient, and leverages the properties of sorting to achieve the desired outcome."

        "content": "\n[description for function: count_inversions]\nThis function counts the number of inversions in an array, which are pairs of elements that are out of order. It initializes a temporary array to assist in the sorting process and then calls a merge sort algorithm that also counts inversions. The merge sort divides the array into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and counts how many times elements from the right subarray are placed before elements from the left subarray, indicating an inversion. Finally, it returns the total count of inversions found in the array. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases by reading input values and processing each array accordingly. The result is printed for each test case.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to analyze the order of elements in an array, particularly in sorting algorithms or data analysis tasks. It can be applied in competitive programming, algorithm design, and optimization problems where understanding the number of inversions can help in determining the efficiency of sorting methods or in assessing the degree of disorder in a dataset. Additionally, it can be beneficial in applications involving data structures like binary indexed trees or segment trees, where inversion counting is a common operation."
