1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 961 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem requires us to count the number of inversions in an array of natural numbers for multiple test cases. An inversion is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j]. 

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To efficiently count the number of inversions, we can use a modified merge sort algorithm. The merge sort will help us sort the array while simultaneously counting the inversions. During the merge step, when we take an element from the right half before taking an element from the left half, it indicates that there are inversions equal to the number of remaining elements in the left half.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_inversions(arr):
       if length of arr <= 1:
           return 0
       mid = length of arr // 2
       left = arr[0:mid]
       right = arr[mid:length of arr]
       
       inversions = count_inversions(left) + count_inversions(right)
       inversions += merge_and_count(arr, left, right)
       return inversions

   function merge_and_count(arr, left, right):
       i = 0, j = 0, k = 0
       inversions = 0

               i += 1
           else:
               arr[k] = right[j]
               inversions += (length of left - i)  // Count inversions
               j += 1
           k += 1
       while i < length of left:
           arr[k] = left[i]
           i += 1
           k += 1
       while j < length of right:
           arr[k] = right[j]
           j += 1
           k += 1
       return inversions

## Memories

[Summary]:
    The task involved generating the next permutation of a sequence of numbers in lexicographic order. The core concept tested was understanding how to manipulate permutations efficiently, particularly identifying the rightmost ascent in the sequence and performing swaps and reversals to achieve the next permutation.

    The solution strategy involved:
    1. Finding the longest non-increasing suffix of the permutation.
    2. Identifying the pivot element just before this suffix.
    3. Swapping this pivot with the smallest element in the suffix that is larger than it.
    4. Reversing the suffix to get the next permutation.

    The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output requirements. The code utilized a helper function for reversing the suffix, which kept the main function clean and focused on the permutation logic.

    The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def reverse(arr, start):
        end = len(arr) - 1
        while start < end:
            arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
            start += 1
            end -= 1

    def next_permutation(permutation):
        n = len(permutation)
        i = n - 2
        while i >= 0 and permutation[i] >= permutation[i + 1]:
            i -= 1
        if i < 0:
            return sorted(permutation)  # Return the first permutation
    
        j = n - 1
        while permutation[j] <= permutation[i]:
            j -= 1
    
        permutation[i], permutation[j] = permutation[j], permutation[i]
        reverse(permutation, i + 1)
        return permutation

    # Read input
    N, K = map(int, input().split())
    for _ in range(K):
        permutation = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = next_permutation(permutation)
        print(" ".join(map(str, result)))
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding permutation generation algorithms and their applications in combinatorial problems.

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the problems created by his setters, the number of problems needed for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the available days to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging simple loops and arithmetic.

    The final implementation was clean and efficient, successfully passing all provided test cases. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all edge cases (like having fewer problems than needed for a single contest) are considered. The solution was implemented without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints given. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def max_contests(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    max_contests(T)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of clear problem understanding and systematic solution development.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    The task was to calculate the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to a given number "N" for multiple test cases. The solution involved identifying the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N, calculating the number of terms in the series of multiples of 10, and then using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to compute the result efficiently.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to work with arithmetic series and integer division to find multiples. The approach was straightforward: determine the largest multiple of 10, count how many multiples exist up to that point, and apply the sum formula. This method is efficient and avoids any potential issues with large numbers, as Python handles large integers natively.

    The final implementation was successful, and the code was structured to read input, process each test case, and output results correctly. The key takeaway is the importance of understanding arithmetic series and how to leverage mathematical formulas for efficient computation, especially when dealing with potentially large inputs. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):
        largest_multiple = (N // 10) * 10
        number_of_terms = largest_multiple // 10
        sum = (number_of_terms * (10 + largest_multiple)) // 2
        return sum

    def main():
        T = int(input())
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)
            print(result)

    main()
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the value of mathematical insights in programming challenges, particularly in optimizing solutions for large input sizes.

INFO - [Task id] 961 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to count how many pairs of elements in an array are out of order, which is known as inversions. An inversion is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j]. We need to do this for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To efficiently count inversions, we can use a modified merge sort algorithm. The idea is to divide the array into two halves, count the inversions in each half recursively, and then count the inversions that cross the two halves while merging them back together. This approach has a time complexity of O(N log N), which is efficient enough given the constraints.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):
       i = left    // Starting index for left subarray

           inv_count += merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right)
       return inv_count

   function count_inversions(arr):

           read array of N integers
           result = count_inversions(array)
           print result
   ```

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to count how many pairs of elements in an array are out of order, which is known as inversions. An inversion is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j]. We need to do this for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To efficiently count inversions, we can use a modified merge sort algorithm. The idea is to divide the array into two halves, count the inversions in each half recursively, and then count the inversions that cross the two halves while merging them back together. This approach has a time complexity of O(N log N), which is efficient enough given the constraints.

    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 961 [generation text] The problem involved counting the number of inversions in an array, which is a common algorithmic challenge. An inversion is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j]. The efficient way to solve this problem is through a modified merge sort algorithm, which allows counting inversions in O(N log N) time complexity.

The solution was structured into three main functions: `merge_and_count`, `merge_sort_and_count`, and `count_inversions`. The `merge_and_count` function merges two halves of the array while counting the inversions that occur between them. The `merge_sort_and_count` function recursively divides the array and aggregates the inversion counts from both halves and the merging process. Finally, `count_inversions` initializes a temporary array and calls the sorting function.

The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the provided test case, demonstrating the effectiveness of the merge sort approach for counting inversions. No unexpected errors occurred during the implementation, and the solution passed all tests. This experience reinforced the importance of understanding divide-and-conquer strategies in algorithm design. 

Key code snippet:
```python
def merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):
    # Merging and counting inversions logic
    ...
```
This encapsulates the core logic for counting inversions while merging sorted subarrays.

INFO - [Task id] 961 [generation text] The official solution effectively implements the merge sort algorithm to count inversions in an array, which is a well-known approach for this problem. The key insights from the official solution that are useful for future reference include:

1. **Recursive Division**: The algorithm divides the array into two halves recursively until it reaches subarrays of size one. This is a fundamental aspect of the merge sort algorithm, allowing for efficient sorting and counting.

2. **Counting Inversions During Merge**: While merging two sorted subarrays, the algorithm counts inversions. If an element from the right subarray is smaller than an element from the left subarray, it indicates that all remaining elements in the left subarray (from the current index to the end) are greater than the current element from the right subarray. This is where the inversion count is updated.

3. **Efficiency**: The overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(N log N), which is efficient for the input constraints provided (up to 100,000 elements). This efficiency is achieved by leveraging the divide-and-conquer strategy inherent in merge sort.

4. **Implementation Details**: The use of a temporary array (`temp_arr`) to store sorted elements during the merge process is crucial. This prevents overwriting the original array and allows for accurate counting of inversions.

5. **Input Handling**: The solution reads multiple test cases in a straightforward manner, which is essential for competitive programming scenarios.

Overall, the official solution is a solid implementation of the merge sort algorithm tailored to count inversions, and it serves as a good reference for similar problems in the future. The approach is clear, efficient, and leverages the properties of sorting to achieve the desired outcome.
