    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**:\n   The problem involves a series of hills with varying heights, and we need to determine the minimum number of water reservoirs required to ensure that all hills receive water. Water can flow from a reservoir in one direction until it reaches a taller hill, at which point it stops. The goal is to strategically place reservoirs and choose their flow direction to minimize the total number of reservoirs used.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**:\n   To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will iterate through the list of hills and determine the optimal placement of reservoirs. For each hill, we will check if it can be supplied with water from a previously placed reservoir. If it cannot, we will place a new reservoir. We will also keep track of the last placed reservoir and its height to decide the direction of water flow.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function min_reservoirs(T):\n       for each test case:\n           read N\n           read heights list\n           initialize reservoirs_count to 0\n           initialize last_height to -1\n           \n           for each height in heights:\n               if height > last_height:\n                   increment reservoirs_count\n                   update last_height to height\n           \n           print reservoirs_count\n\n   read T\n   min_reservoirs(T)\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef min_reservoirs(T):\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        heights = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n        reservoirs_count = 0\n        last_height = -1\n        \n        for height in heights:\n            if height > last_height:\n                reservoirs_count += 1\n                last_height = height\n        \n        print(reservoirs_count)\n\nT = int(input())\nmin_reservoirs(T)\n``` \n\nIn this solution:\n- We read the number of test cases.\n- For each test case, we read the number of hills and their respective heights.\n- We initialize a counter for reservoirs and a variable to track the last height of the placed reservoir.\n- We iterate through the heights, and whenever we find a height greater than the last placed reservoir's height, we increment the reservoir count and update the last height.\n- Finally, we print the total number of reservoirs needed for each test case.",
