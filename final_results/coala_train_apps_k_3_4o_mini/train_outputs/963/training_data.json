    "summary": "In attempting to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of reservoirs needed to supply water to a series of hills, several key concepts and strategies emerged. The core idea is that a reservoir can supply water in one direction until it hits a taller hill, and the goal is to minimize the number of reservoirs used.\n\nInitially, I attempted a greedy approach by counting reservoirs from both left to right and right to left, but this led to over-counting due to not properly managing the conditions under which a hill could be supplied by a reservoir. The logic for marking hills as supplied was flawed, resulting in incorrect counts.\n\nThe main error was in the overlap adjustment logic, where I incorrectly assumed that counting reservoirs from both sides and then adjusting would yield the correct result. Instead, I needed to ensure that reservoirs were only counted when a hill could not be supplied by any previously placed reservoir.\n\nThe final approach should involve iterating through the hills from both directions while maintaining a clear understanding of which hills can be supplied by existing reservoirs. However, despite multiple revisions, the code continued to produce incorrect outputs, indicating a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem's requirements.\n\nThe key takeaway is the importance of carefully tracking the conditions under which reservoirs can supply water and ensuring that the logic accurately reflects the problem's constraints. Future attempts should focus on a more systematic approach to managing the supply conditions and possibly using a more structured data representation to track supplied hills.",
    "reflection": "In my attempts to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of reservoirs needed to supply water to all hills, I encountered several challenges that led to incorrect outputs. My approach involved iterating through the list of hill heights from both directions and attempting to track the maximum heights encountered. However, this method failed to accurately account for the conditions under which reservoirs could effectively supply water to the hills.\n\nThe official solution provided a more elegant and efficient approach by leveraging the concept of recursion. It identifies the peak hill (the highest point) and recursively determines the number of reservoirs needed for the left and right segments of the hills. The key steps in the official solution are as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the Peak**: The solution finds the index of the maximum height in the list of hills.\n2. **Base Cases**: If the peak is at either end of the list, only one reservoir is needed.\n3. **Recursive Division**: For peaks not at the ends, the solution recursively calculates the number of reservoirs needed for the left and right segments of the hills, adding one for the peak itself.\n\nThis recursive approach is effective because it breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems, allowing for a clear and concise calculation of the required reservoirs. My attempts, on the other hand, were overly complex and did not properly handle the conditions for counting reservoirs, leading to excessive counts.\n\nIn summary, the official solution's recursive strategy is a more effective way to tackle the problem, focusing on the peak and its segments, while my approach failed to accurately account for the flow of water from reservoirs. This experience highlights the importance of understanding the problem structure and considering simpler, more efficient methods for solving complex problems.",
