One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.\nEach rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.\nSalmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.\nPlease help Salmon achieve this goal!\n\nIt can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.\n\nIf there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   \n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   \n- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   \n- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \\leq i \\leq N$\n\n-----Output:-----\n- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. \n- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \\leq m1,m2 \\leq K$ and $0 \\leq c1,c2 \\leq N$. \n- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \\leq c1,c2 \\leq N$.\n- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $T=10$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$ \n- $2 \\leq K \\leq 10^5$ \n- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$\n- There can be a color with $0$ ducks\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \\leq N \\leq 10$, $K=2$ \n- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$\n- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n1\n2 4\n3 4 1\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n2 1 1 3\n1 1 0 3\n\n-----Explanation:-----\n- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   \n- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   \n- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Each box can hold a specific number of ducks, and he wants to ensure that each box contains at most two different colors of ducks. The task is to determine how to distribute the ducks into the boxes while adhering to these constraints.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of duck colors and their counts. We will fill each box with ducks, ensuring that we do not exceed the box capacity and that we only use up to two colors per box.

The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the available days to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging simple loops and arithmetic.\n\n    The final implementation was clean and efficient, successfully passing all provided test cases. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all edge cases (like having fewer problems than needed for a single contest) are considered. The solution was implemented without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints given. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_contests(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    max_contests(T)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of clear problem understanding and systematic solution development.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money (K) to N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money, such that he ends up with exactly zero. The key insights were that if the total demand from all minions exceeds K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and if the total demand equals K, he can distribute the money exactly.\n\n    Initially, I implemented a solution that simply checked if the total demand was greater than, equal to, or less than K. However, this approach failed to account for the scenario where the total demand was less than K but could still be distributed in a way that Gru ends up with zero. The logic needed to ensure that Gru could fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.\n\n    The correct approach involves:\n    1. Calculating the total demand.\n    2. Checking if the total demand exceeds K (output \"NO\").\n    3. If the total demand equals K, output \"YES\".\n    4. If the total demand is less than K, output \"NO\" since Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.\n\n    The final code snippet that captures this logic is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, input().split())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n            total_demand = sum(A)\n        \n            if total_demand > K:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            elif total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    can_distribute_money(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the conditions under which money can be distributed and ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution effectively simplifies the problem by directly calculating the total number of problems and determining how many contests can be formed in a straightforward manner. The key steps are:\n\n    1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it captures the number of setters (N), the number of problems required for a contest (K), and the number of days available (D).\n    2. **Problem Summation**: It computes the total number of problems created by summing the list of problems from each setter.\n    3. **Contest Calculation**: It calculates the maximum number of contests that can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems required for each contest.\n    4. **Final Output**: It prints the minimum of the contests possible and the days available, ensuring that the output respects the constraints of the problem.\n\n    The official solution is concise and efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for input and summation, which keeps the code clean and readable. \n\n    One insight from this experience is the importance of directly addressing the problem constraints in a clear manner. The official solution does this effectively by using a single line to compute the number of contests and another to print the result, which is both efficient and easy to understand. \n\n    Overall, the approach I took was similar, but the official solution's brevity and clarity highlight the effectiveness of straightforward calculations in competitive programming.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

Ultimately, the function outputs the color and count of ducks in each box for all test cases.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to distribute items (in this case, rubber ducks) into containers (boxes) while adhering to specific constraints, such as limiting the number of distinct types (colors) in each container. This can apply to various real-world situations, such as organizing inventory in warehouses, packing items for shipping, or even in programming challenges that involve resource allocation with restrictions. Understanding how to manage and distribute resources efficiently while following rules can help in optimizing processes in logistics, event planning, and even game development."
