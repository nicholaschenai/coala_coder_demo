    "raw_msg": "Let's revisit the original problem regarding the distribution of tiles in the Chef's houses and ensure we implement the correct logic to count the total number of rooms that can be completely tiled.\n\n### Problem Recap:\n- The Chef has \\(N\\) boxes of tiles, where the \\(i\\)-th box contains \\(i\\) tiles.\n- Each room in both houses has an area of \\(i^2\\) (where \\(i\\) is the room number).\n- We need to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes, ensuring that each room is tiled with tiles from a single box and that the same number of tiles is used in two rooms (one from each house).\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. For a box containing \\(i\\) tiles, we can only tile two rooms completely if \\(i\\) is even, because we need to split the tiles evenly between two rooms.\n2. The area of the rooms is \\(i^2\\), so we need to check if \\(i\\) tiles can cover two rooms of size \\(i^2\\). This means we need to find pairs of rooms that can be tiled with the tiles from the boxes.\n\n### Correct Approach:\n- For each box \\(i\\) from 1 to \\(N\\):\n  - If \\(i\\) is even, it can tile two rooms of size \\((i/2)^2\\).\n  - We need to count how many such pairs of rooms can be tiled completely.\n\n### Final Python Code:\nHere\u2019s the corrected code that implements the above logic:\n\n```python\ndef count_tiled_rooms(N):\n    total_rooms = 0\n    # We can only use boxes with even numbers of tiles\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        if i % 2 == 0:  # Check if the box has an even number of tiles\n            total_rooms += 2  # Each even box can tile two rooms\n    return total_rooms\n\ndef main():\n    T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N\n        result = count_tiled_rooms(N)  # Calculate the total tiled rooms\n        print(result)  # Output the result\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- The function `count_tiled_rooms(N)` iterates through each box from 1 to \\(N\\).\n- It checks if the box number \\(i\\) is even. If it is, it adds 2 to the total count of rooms that can be tiled (one room from each house).\n- The `main()` function handles input and output as specified, reading the number of test cases and processing each case accordingly.\n\nThis implementation should now correctly count the total number of rooms that can be tiled completely for each test case.",
