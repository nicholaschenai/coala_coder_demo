    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to determine how many rooms in two houses can be completely tiled using tiles from boxes, where the i-th box contains i tiles and each room has an area of \\(i^2\\). The key insight was that only even-numbered boxes could be used to tile two rooms completely, as the tiles need to be split evenly between the two rooms.\n\nInitially, I miscalculated the total number of rooms that could be tiled by simply counting all even boxes and multiplying by 2, which led to incorrect outputs. The correct approach required understanding that for each even box \\(i\\), it could tile two rooms of size \\((i/2)^2\\) only if \\(i\\) was less than or equal to \\(N\\).\n\nThe final solution should have focused on counting how many even numbers exist up to \\(N\\) and then determining how many rooms could be tiled based on those even numbers. The correct formula for the number of rooms that can be tiled is \\(N // 2\\), as each even number contributes exactly 2 rooms.\n\nHere\u2019s the corrected code snippet for future reference:\n\n```python\ndef count_tiled_rooms(N):\n    return (N // 2) * 2  # Each even number contributes 2 rooms\n\ndef main():\n    T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N\n        result = count_tiled_rooms(N)  # Calculate the total tiled rooms\n        print(result)  # Output the result\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing the problem requirements and ensuring that the logic aligns with the constraints provided.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\nIn my attempts to solve the problem, I initially misunderstood the requirements for counting the number of rooms that could be tiled completely. My approach focused on iterating through each box and checking if the number of tiles was even, which led to incorrect calculations. The key insight I missed was that the problem can be simplified significantly by recognizing that the number of rooms that can be tiled is directly related to the largest perfect square that can be formed with the available tiles.\n\nThe official solution effectively leverages the mathematical properties of perfect squares. By dividing \\(N\\) by 2, it determines how many pairs of rooms can be tiled, and then it calculates the maximum room number \\(k\\) that can be tiled completely using the formula \\(k = 2 \\times \\text{int}(n^{0.5})\\). This approach is efficient and avoids unnecessary iterations, leading to a time complexity of \\(O(1)\\) for each test case.\n\nIn summary, the official solution's use of mathematical properties to derive the result directly is a more effective approach than my initial iterative method. This experience highlights the importance of recognizing patterns and mathematical relationships in problem-solving, especially in competitive programming contexts.",
