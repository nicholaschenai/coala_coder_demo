    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the Problem**: \n   The Chef has bought N boxes of tiles, where the i-th box contains i tiles. He has two houses, each with N rooms, and the area of the i-th room is i*i. The goal is to determine how many rooms in both houses can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes, ensuring that each room is tiled with tiles from a single box and that the same number of tiles is used in two rooms (one from each house).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a Solution**: \n   For each box i, the number of tiles is i. To tile two rooms completely, we need to check if the number of tiles in the box can be evenly divided between the two rooms. This means that the area of the rooms (i*i) must be equal to the number of tiles used from the box. Therefore, we need to find pairs of rooms (one from each house) that can be tiled using the tiles from the boxes. The maximum room number that can be tiled completely is determined by the largest box that can tile the rooms.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   - Initialize a counter for the total number of rooms tiled.\n   - For each box from 1 to N:\n     - Check if the box can tile two rooms (i.e., if i is even).\n     - If it can, increment the counter by 2 (for the two rooms).\n   - Output the total count of rooms tiled for each test case.\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef count_tiled_rooms(N):\n    total_rooms = 0\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        if i * i <= i:  # Check if the box can tile two rooms\n            total_rooms += 2  # Each box can tile two rooms\n    return total_rooms\n\ndef main():\n    T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N\n        result = count_tiled_rooms(N)  # Calculate the total tiled rooms\n        print(result)  # Output the result\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n``` \n\nThis code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, calculates how many rooms can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes, and then prints the result.",
