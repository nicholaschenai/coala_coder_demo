    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   Chef has a certain number of empty boxes (K) and a number of apples (N) that is a multiple of K. He wants to know if the way the apples are distributed into the boxes can result in different final distributions depending on which of two candidates he hires. The first candidate distributes one apple to each box, while the second candidate puts all K apples into the box with the least apples. The task is to determine if the final distributions can differ based on the candidate chosen.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To determine if the distributions can differ, we need to analyze the two methods of distribution:\n   - The first candidate will always distribute the apples evenly across all boxes, resulting in each box having the same number of apples (N/K).\n   - The second candidate, however, can potentially leave some boxes empty while filling others, leading to a situation where one box could have all the apples while others have none.\n   The key insight is that if K is equal to 1, both candidates will produce the same result (all apples in one box). If K is greater than 1, the distributions can differ. Therefore, the answer is \"YES\" if K > 1 and \"NO\" if K = 1.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function can_distribute_apples(T):\n       for each test case from 1 to T:\n           read N, K\n           if K == 1:\n               print \"NO\"\n           else:\n               print \"YES\"\n\n   read T\n   can_distribute_apples(T)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef can_distribute_apples(T):\n    # Loop through each test case\n    for _ in range(T):\n        # Read the values of N and K\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        # If K is 1, both candidates will produce the same distribution\n        if K == 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            # If K is greater than 1, the distributions can differ\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\n# Call the function to process the test cases\ncan_distribute_apples(T)\n```",
