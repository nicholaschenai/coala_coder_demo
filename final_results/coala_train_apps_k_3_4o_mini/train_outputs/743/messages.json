He ordered $N$ apples, where $N$ is a multiple of $K$. Now, he just needs to hire someone who will distribute the apples into the boxes with professional passion. \nOnly two candidates passed all the interviews for the box filling job. In one minute, each candidate can put $K$ apples into boxes, but they do it in different ways: the first candidate puts exactly one apple in each box, while the second one chooses a random box with the smallest number of apples and puts $K$ apples in it.\nChef is wondering if the final distribution of apples can even depend on which candidate he hires. Can you answer that question?\nNote: The boxes are distinguishable (labeled), while the apples are not. Therefore, two distributions of apples are different if there is a box such that the number of apples in it when the first candidate finishes working can be different from the number of apples in it when the second candidate finishes working.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. \n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string \"YES\" if the final distributions of apples can be different or \"NO\" if they will be the same (without quotes).\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 250$\n- $1 \\le N, K \\le 10^{18}$\n- $N$ is divisible by $K$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (30 points): $1 \\le N, K \\le 10^5$\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n-----Example Input-----\n3\n5 1\n4 2\n10 10\n\n-----Example Output-----\nNO\nNO\nYES\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1: No matter who is hired, all apples will be in the only box at the end.\nExample case 2: At the end, there will be two apples in each box.\nExample case 3: If we hire the first candidate, there will be one apple in each box, but if we hire the second one, there will be $10$ apples in one box and none in all other boxes.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

There are two candidates who can help with this task. The first candidate distributes the apples evenly, putting one apple in each box until all apples are distributed. The second candidate puts all K apples into the box that currently has the least number of apples. The question is whether the final distribution of apples in the boxes can be different depending on which candidate is hired.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To determine if the final distributions can differ, we need to analyze how each candidate distributes the apples:\n   - The first candidate will always distribute the apples evenly across all boxes, resulting in each box having the same number of apples.\n   - The second candidate, however, may end up putting all apples into one box if K equals N, or may distribute them unevenly if K is less than N. \n   Therefore, if K equals N, the second candidate will fill one box completely, while the first candidate will distribute them evenly. In all other cases, if K is less than N, the distributions will be the same because both candidates will end up filling the boxes in a way that results in the same number of apples in each box.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Read the number of test cases T\n   For each test case:\n       Read N and K\n       If K == N:\n           Print \"YES\" (distributions can be different)\n       Else:\n           Print \"NO\" (distributions will be the same)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\n\n# Iterate through each test case\nfor _ in range(T):\n    # Read N and K\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    # Check if K is equal to N\n    if K == N:\n        # If K equals N, the distributions can be different\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        # Otherwise, the distributions will be the same\n        print(\"NO\")\n```"

The key insights were that if the total demand from all minions exceeds K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and if the total demand equals K, he can distribute the money exactly.\n\n    Initially, I implemented a solution that simply checked if the total demand was greater than, equal to, or less than K. However, this approach failed to account for the scenario where the total demand was less than K but could still be distributed in a way that Gru ends up with zero. The logic needed to ensure that Gru could fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.\n\n    The correct approach involves:\n    1. Calculating the total demand.\n    2. Checking if the total demand exceeds K (output \"NO\").\n    3. If the total demand equals K, output \"YES\".\n    4. If the total demand is less than K, output \"NO\" since Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.\n\n    The final code snippet that captures this logic is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, input().split())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n            total_demand = sum(A)\n        \n            if total_demand > K:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            elif total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    can_distribute_money(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the conditions under which money can be distributed and ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the problems created by his setters, the number of problems needed for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the available days to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging simple loops and arithmetic.\n\n    The final implementation was clean and efficient, successfully passing all provided test cases. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all edge cases (like having fewer problems than needed for a single contest) are considered. The solution was implemented without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints given. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_contests(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    max_contests(T)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of clear problem understanding and systematic solution development.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to calculate the number of valid schedules for Chef's restaurant, where dishes must be served over \\(N\\) days with specific constraints: consecutive days must have different dishes, and the first and last dishes must also be different.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    1. **Understanding the Combinatorial Nature**: The problem required a combinatorial approach to count valid arrangements based on the number of days. The choices for each day depended on the previous day's choice, leading to a recursive pattern.\n\n    2. **Formulating the Correct Logic**:\n       - For \\(N = 2\\): The valid combinations are \\(4 \\times 3\\).\n       - For \\(N = 3\\): The valid combinations are \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 2\\).\n       - For \\(N \\geq 4\\): The correct formula should be \\(4 \\times 3^{(N-1)}\\) because:\n         - The first day has 4 choices.\n         - The second day has 3 choices.\n         - Each of the next \\(N-2\\) days has 3 choices.\n         - The last day must be different from the first dish, which is already accounted for in the choices.\n\n    ### Errors and Fixes:\n    - Initially, I miscalculated the formula for \\(N \\geq 4\\) by incorrectly considering the last dish's constraints. The correct approach was to ensure that the last dish is different from the first while maintaining the choices for the middle days.\n    - The final formula for \\(N \\geq 4\\) was adjusted to correctly reflect the choices available.\n\n    ### Final Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def calculate_schedules(N):\n        if N == 2:\n            return (4 * 3) % (10**9 + 7)\n        elif N == 3:\n            return (4 * 3 * 2) % (10**9 + 7)\n        else:\n            return (4 * 3 * (3 ** (N - 2))) % (10**9 + 7)\n\n    def main():\n        T = int(input())\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            result = calculate_schedules(N)\n            print(result)\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering constraints in combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accurately reflected in the formulas used.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
