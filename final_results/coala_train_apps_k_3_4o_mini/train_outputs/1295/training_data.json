The error stemmed from miscalculating the indices for the Fibonacci numbers. The correct formula for the sum of Fibonacci numbers from \\( F(N) \\) to \\( F(K) \\) is \\( S(N, K) = F(K + 1) - F(N) \\).

    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\nIn attempting to solve the problem of calculating the sum of Fibonacci numbers from \\( F(N) \\) to \\( F(K) \\), I initially approached it using matrix exponentiation, which is a common technique for efficiently computing Fibonacci numbers. However, my solution faced issues with the formula used for summing the Fibonacci numbers, leading to incorrect outputs for certain test cases.\n\nThe official solution provided a more nuanced approach that leverages both the properties of Fibonacci numbers and modular arithmetic. Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Fibonacci Calculation**: The official solution uses a recursive method to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently. The function `_fib(n)` computes Fibonacci numbers using a divide-and-conquer approach, which is more efficient than the matrix exponentiation method I used. This method reduces the time complexity significantly by breaking down the problem recursively.\n\n2. **Modular Arithmetic**: The official solution consistently applies modular arithmetic to ensure that the results remain within bounds, which is crucial given the constraints of the problem. This is done using a modulus value of \\( 10^9 + 7 \\).\n\n3. **Sum Calculation**: The official solution includes a `brute` function that calculates the sum of Fibonacci numbers multiplied by powers of \\( k \\). This is a different approach than my initial attempt, which focused solely on the range of Fibonacci numbers without considering the multiplicative factor of \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Final Answer Calculation**: The `ans` function in the official solution combines the results of the Fibonacci calculations and applies the modular inverse to ensure the final result is computed correctly. This step is crucial for handling cases where division is involved in modular arithmetic.\n\n### Key Code Snippets from the Official Solution\n- **Fibonacci Calculation**:\n    ```python\n    def _fib(n):\n        if n == 0:\n            return (0, 1)\n        else:\n            a, b = _fib(n // 2)\n            c = (a * (b * 2 - a)) % mod\n            d = (a * a + b * b) % mod\n            if n % 2 == 0:\n                return (c, d)\n            else:\n                return (d, c + d)\n    ```\n\n- **Sum Calculation**:\n    ```python\n    def ans(n, k):\n        k %= mod\n        a = pow(k, n + 1, mod)\n        b = (a * k) % mod\n        x = a * (fibonacci(n + 1)) + b * fibonacci(n) - k\n        y = inv((k * k + k - 1) % mod)\n        return ((x * y) % mod + mod) % mod\n    ```\n\n### Conclusion\nThis experience highlighted the importance of understanding the mathematical properties of the problem and how they can be leveraged to create efficient algorithms. The official solution's use of recursive Fibonacci calculation and modular arithmetic provided a more effective approach than my initial attempt. In future problems, I will pay closer attention to the mathematical foundations and consider multiple approaches to ensure robustness in my solutions.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThis function reads an integer input representing the number of queries and then processes each query by reading two integers, N and K. For each query, it calculates the sum of Fibonacci numbers from F(N) to F(K) using a specific summation function. The result for each query is then printed to the console. The function handles multiple queries in a loop, ensuring that each result is output sequentially. It utilizes efficient Fibonacci calculations to manage potentially large values of N and K. Overall, it serves as an interface for user input and output related to Fibonacci sums.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to efficiently compute Fibonacci numbers and their sums over large ranges, especially when dealing with constraints that allow for very large inputs (up to 10^18). It can be applied in competitive programming, algorithm design, and optimization problems where performance is critical. The matrix exponentiation technique demonstrated here is particularly valuable for problems involving recurrence relations, as it allows for logarithmic time complexity in computing Fibonacci numbers, making it feasible to handle multiple queries quickly."
