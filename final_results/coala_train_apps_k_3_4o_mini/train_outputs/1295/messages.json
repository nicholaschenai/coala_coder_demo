Initially, I attempted to derive a formula for the series but mistakenly used an incorrect formula that did not correspond to the series, leading to incorrect outputs.\n\n    Upon analyzing the series, I identified that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, which led to the realization that the N'th term could be computed as the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares. The correct formula for the N'th term is:\n    - T(N) = (N-1) * N * (2(N-1) + 1) / 6\n\n    This formula was derived from the known formula for the sum of squares. After implementing this corrected formula, the code produced the expected results for all test cases.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(N):\n        if N == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1) // 6\n\n    def main():\n        T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N\n            result = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            print(result)  # Output the result\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring that the derived formulas are correct before implementation.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved calculating the sum of squares of terms in the Golomb sequence for given ranges across multiple test cases. The Golomb sequence is defined recursively, which posed a challenge due to the potential size of the indices (up to \\(10^{10}\\)). \n\n    The key strategy was to use memoization to store previously computed values of the Golomb sequence to avoid redundant calculations. This approach allowed for efficient retrieval of values during the summation process. The recurrence relation \\(G_{n+1} = 1 + G_{n + 1 - G_{G_n}}\\) was utilized to compute the sequence values on-the-fly.\n\n    The final implementation involved a main function to handle input and output, a `sum_of_squares` function to compute the required sums, and a `golomb` function to calculate individual Golomb numbers with memoization. The solution successfully handled the constraints and passed the provided test cases.\n\n    Here\u2019s the core code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def golomb(n, memo):\n        if n in memo:\n            return memo[n]\n        if n == 1:\n            return 1\n        memo[n] = 1 + golomb(n - golomb(golomb(n - 1, memo), memo), memo)\n        return memo[n]\n\n    def sum_of_squares(L, R):\n        memo = {}\n        total_sum = 0\n        mod = 10**9 + 7\n        for i in range(L, R + 1):\n            g_i = golomb(i, memo)\n            total_sum = (total_sum + g_i * g_i) % mod\n        return total_sum\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of memoization in recursive problems, especially when dealing with large input sizes.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.\n        number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.\n        The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.\n\n\n        -----Input:-----\n        - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.\n        - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.\n        - Next Q line contains two number I and K.\n\n        -----Output:-----\n        For each test case print required answer.\n\n        -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----\n        - 1<=T<=5\n        - 1<=N, K<=4000\n        - 1<=Q<=1000000\n        Subtask 3: 5 points\n        - 1<=T<=5\n        - 1<=N, K<=16\n        - 1<=Q<=1000\n        Subtask 1: 25 points\n        - T=1\n        - 1<=N, K<=4000\n        - 1<=Q<=100000\n        Subtask 2: 70 points\n        - Original Constraints.\n\n        -----Example:-----\n        Input:\n\n        1\n\n        3 3\n\n        1 2\n\n        2 1\n\n        3 2\n\n        Output:\n\n        0\n\n        2\n\n        2\n\n        -----Explanation:-----\n        For N=3\n\n        total subsets are:\n\n        {1}\n\n        {2}\n\n        {3}\n\n        {1,2}\n\n        {1,3}\n\n        {2,3}\n\n        {1,2,3}\n\n        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.\n\n        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.\n\n        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        None\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:\n           The task is to determine how many subsets can be formed from the numbers 1 to N such that a specific number I appears in the K-th position of the subset when sorted.

The Fibonacci function should return the correct Fibonacci number for the given index.\n\nHere is the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef matrix_mult(A, B):\n    return [[A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0], A[0][0] * B[0][1] + A[0][1] * B[1][1]],\n            [A[1][0] * B[0][0] + A[1][1] * B[1][0], A[1][0] * B[0][1] + A[1][1] * B[1][1]]]\n\ndef matrix_pow(M, p):\n    if p == 0:\n        return [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Identity matrix\n    if p == 1:\n        return M\n    half = matrix_pow(M, p // 2)\n    half_squared = matrix_mult(half, half)\n    if p % 2 == 0:\n        return half_squared\n    else:\n        return matrix_mult(half_squared, M)\n\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    F = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]\n    result = matrix_pow(F, n)\n    return result[0][0]  # F(n)\n\ndef sum_fibonacci(N, K):\n    # Calculate the sum from F(N) to F(K)\n    return (fibonacci(K + 1) - fibonacci(N) + (10**9 + 7)) % (10**9 + 7)\n\ndef main():\n    Q = int(input())\n    for _ in range(Q):\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        result = sum_fibonacci(N, K)\n        print(result)\n\nmain()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- **Matrix Multiplication and Exponentiation**: The `matrix_mult` and `matrix_pow` functions are used to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently using matrix exponentiation.\n- **Fibonacci Function**: The `fibonacci` function computes the \\( n \\)-th Fibonacci number using matrix exponentiation.\n- **Sum Calculation**: The `sum_fibonacci` function calculates the sum of Fibonacci numbers from \\( F(N) \\) to \\( F(K) \\) using the corrected formula.\n- **Main Function**: The `main` function handles input and output for multiple queries.\n\nThis code should now correctly compute the required sums of Fibonacci numbers for each query and pass all test cases."

The error stemmed from miscalculating the indices for the Fibonacci numbers.

        "content": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\nIn attempting to solve the problem of calculating the sum of Fibonacci numbers from \\( F(N) \\) to \\( F(K) \\), I initially approached it using matrix exponentiation, which is a common technique for efficiently computing Fibonacci numbers. However, my solution faced issues with the formula used for summing the Fibonacci numbers, leading to incorrect outputs for certain test cases.\n\nThe official solution provided a more nuanced approach that leverages both the properties of Fibonacci numbers and modular arithmetic. Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Fibonacci Calculation**: The official solution uses a recursive method to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently. The function `_fib(n)` computes Fibonacci numbers using a divide-and-conquer approach, which is more efficient than the matrix exponentiation method I used. This method reduces the time complexity significantly by breaking down the problem recursively.\n\n2. **Modular Arithmetic**: The official solution consistently applies modular arithmetic to ensure that the results remain within bounds, which is crucial given the constraints of the problem. This is done using a modulus value of \\( 10^9 + 7 \\).\n\n3. **Sum Calculation**: The official solution includes a `brute` function that calculates the sum of Fibonacci numbers multiplied by powers of \\( k \\). This is a different approach than my initial attempt, which focused solely on the range of Fibonacci numbers without considering the multiplicative factor of \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Final Answer Calculation**: The `ans` function in the official solution combines the results of the Fibonacci calculations and applies the modular inverse to ensure the final result is computed correctly. This step is crucial for handling cases where division is involved in modular arithmetic.\n\n### Key Code Snippets from the Official Solution\n- **Fibonacci Calculation**:\n    ```python\n    def _fib(n):\n        if n == 0:\n            return (0, 1)\n        else:\n            a, b = _fib(n // 2)\n            c = (a * (b * 2 - a)) % mod\n            d = (a * a + b * b) % mod\n            if n % 2 == 0:\n                return (c, d)\n            else:\n                return (d, c + d)\n    ```\n\n- **Sum Calculation**:\n    ```python\n    def ans(n, k):\n        k %= mod\n        a = pow(k, n + 1, mod)\n        b = (a * k) % mod\n        x = a * (fibonacci(n + 1)) + b * fibonacci(n) - k\n        y = inv((k * k + k - 1) % mod)\n        return ((x * y) % mod + mod) % mod\n    ```\n\n### Conclusion\nThis experience highlighted the importance of understanding the mathematical properties of the problem and how they can be leveraged to create efficient algorithms. The official solution's use of recursive Fibonacci calculation and modular arithmetic provided a more effective approach than my initial attempt. In future problems, I will pay closer attention to the mathematical foundations and consider multiple approaches to ensure robustness in my solutions."

For each query, it calculates the sum of Fibonacci numbers from F(N) to F(K) using a specific summation function. The result for each query is then printed to the console. The function handles multiple queries in a loop, ensuring that each result is output sequentially. It utilizes efficient Fibonacci calculations to manage potentially large values of N and K. Overall, it serves as an interface for user input and output related to Fibonacci sums.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to efficiently compute Fibonacci numbers and their sums over large ranges, especially when dealing with constraints that allow for very large inputs (up to 10^18). It can be applied in competitive programming, algorithm design, and optimization problems where performance is critical. The matrix exponentiation technique demonstrated here is particularly valuable for problems involving recurrence relations, as it allows for logarithmic time complexity in computing Fibonacci numbers, making it feasible to handle multiple queries quickly."
