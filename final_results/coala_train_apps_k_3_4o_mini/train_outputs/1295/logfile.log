[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In the year 4242, the language Haskell has evolved so much that it has become an AI. It can solve very challenging problems, in very little time. Humanity is worried that Haskell will take over the world. All hopes remain tied to the Competitive Programming community as they are the expert in shaving milliseconds off code runtime. Haskell creators have found one particular task that if solved faster than Haskell itself, can be used to hack into Haskell's codebase and thus defeat it. The exact details of the task are as follows,


" Calculate the sum, S(N, K) = , for Q queries. Here Fi is ith Fibonacci number defined as: Fi = i if i = 0 or 1 and Fi = Fi-1 + Fi-2 if i >= 2. "


You being a member of the Competitive Programming community are encouraged to make a submission to this task.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer Q, the number of queries.

Each of the next Q lines contain two integers each, Ni and Ki.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to calculate a sum based on Fibonacci numbers for multiple queries. Each query provides two numbers, N and K, and we need to compute the sum of the first K Fibonacci numbers starting from the N-th Fibonacci number.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - The Fibonacci sequence is defined such that F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, and for any i >= 2, F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2).
   - For each query, we need to find the N-th Fibonacci number and then sum the next K Fibonacci numbers starting from F(N).
   - Given the constraints (N and K can be as large as 10^18), we cannot compute Fibonacci numbers directly using a simple iterative or recursive approach due to time and space limitations.
   - Instead, we can use matrix exponentiation to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently in logarithmic time.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... for multiple test cases. Initially, I attempted to derive a formula for the series but mistakenly used an incorrect formula that did not correspond to the series, leading to incorrect outputs.

    Upon analyzing the series, I identified that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, which led to the realization that the N'th term could be computed as the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares. The correct formula for the N'th term is:
    - T(N) = (N-1) * N * (2(N-1) + 1) / 6

    This formula was derived from the known formula for the sum of squares. After implementing this corrected formula, the code produced the expected results for all test cases.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(N):
        if N == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1) // 6

    def main():
        T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N
            result = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            print(result)  # Output the result

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring that the derived formulas are correct before implementation.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    The problem involved calculating the sum of squares of terms in the Golomb sequence for given ranges across multiple test cases. The Golomb sequence is defined recursively, which posed a challenge due to the potential size of the indices (up to \(10^{10}\)). 

    The key strategy was to use memoization to store previously computed values of the Golomb sequence to avoid redundant calculations. This approach allowed for efficient retrieval of values during the summation process. The recurrence relation \(G_{n+1} = 1 + G_{n + 1 - G_{G_n}}\) was utilized to compute the sequence values on-the-fly.

    The final implementation involved a main function to handle input and output, a `sum_of_squares` function to compute the required sums, and a `golomb` function to calculate individual Golomb numbers with memoization. The solution successfully handled the constraints and passed the provided test cases.

    Hereâ€™s the core code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def golomb(n, memo):
        if n in memo:
            return memo[n]
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        memo[n] = 1 + golomb(n - golomb(golomb(n - 1, memo), memo), memo)
        return memo[n]

    def sum_of_squares(L, R):
        memo = {}
        total_sum = 0
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        for i in range(L, R + 1):
            g_i = golomb(i, memo)
            total_sum = (total_sum + g_i * g_i) % mod
        return total_sum
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of memoization in recursive problems, especially when dealing with large input sizes.

        Output:

        0

        2

        2

        -----Explanation:-----
        For N=3

        total subsets are:

        {1}

        {2}

        {3}

        {1,2}

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

    [Previous Critique]:
        None
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
           The task is to determine how many subsets can be formed from the numbers 1 to N such that a specific number I appears in the K-th position of the subset when sorted. The output should be the count of such subsets for multiple queries, and since the result can be large, it should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
           To solve this problem, we need to:
           - Understand that for a number I to be in the K-th position of a subset, there must be exactly \(K-1\) numbers less than I in the subset.
           - The remaining numbers in the subset can be chosen from the numbers greater than I.
           - We can use combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of ways to choose \(K-1\) numbers from the \(I-1\) numbers less than I and any number of numbers from the \(N-I\) numbers greater than I.
           - The total number of valid subsets can be calculated using combinations and powers of 2.

        3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
           ```
           function calculate_combinations(n, k):
               if k > n or k < 0:
                   return 0
               return factorial(n) / (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))

           function count_subsets(N, I, K):
               if K > I or K < 1:
                   return 0
               count_less_than_I = calculate_combinations(I - 1, K - 1)
               count_greater_than_I = 2^(N - I)
               return (count_less_than_I * count_greater_than_I) % (10^9 + 7)

           function main():
               read T
               for each test case:
                   read N, Q
                   for each query:
                       read I, K
                       result = count_subsets(N, I, K)
                       print(result)
           ```

        4. **Final Python Code**:
        ```python
        def factorial(n):
            if n == 0 or n == 1:
                return 1

            for i in range(2, n + 1):
                result = (result * i) % (10**9 + 7)
            return result

        def calculate_combinations(n, k):

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] 1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
   The task is to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from the N-th Fibonacci number to the K-th Fibonacci number for multiple queries. The Fibonacci sequence is defined such that the first two numbers are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Given the constraints, we need to handle very large values for N and K, which can go up to \(10^{18}\).

2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
   To efficiently compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers for large indices, we can use matrix exponentiation. The Fibonacci sequence can be represented using matrix multiplication, which allows us to compute Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time. The sum of Fibonacci numbers can be derived from the properties of the Fibonacci sequence:
   - The sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers can be expressed as \(F(n+2) - 1\).
   - Therefore, to find the sum from \(F(N)\) to \(F(K)\), we can compute:
     \[
     S(N, K) = F(K+2) - F(N+1) - 1
     \]
   This approach allows us to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently even for very large indices.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In the year 4242, the language Haskell has evolved so much that it has become an AI. It can solve very challenging problems, in very little time. Humanity is worried that Haskell will take over the world. All hopes remain tied to the Competitive Programming community as they are the expert in shaving milliseconds off code runtime. Haskell creators have found one particular task that if solved faster than Haskell itself, can be used to hack into Haskell's codebase and thus defeat it. The exact details of the task are as follows,


" Calculate the sum, S(N, K) = , for Q queries. Here Fi is ith Fibonacci number defined as: Fi = i if i = 0 or 1 and Fi = Fi-1 + Fi-2 if i >= 2. "


You being a member of the Competitive Programming community are encouraged to make a submission to this task.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer Q, the number of queries.

Each of the next Q lines contain two integers each, Ni and Ki.

-----Output-----

Output Q lines with one integer each. The ith line should contain the value S(Ni, Ki).

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= Q <= 5*104
- 1 <= N <= 1018
- 1 <= K <= 1018

-----Example-----
Input:
1
1 1
Output:
1

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Fibonacci Sequence**:
   The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - \( F(0) = 0 \)
   - \( F(1) = 1 \)
   - \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \) for \( n \geq 2 \)

   The sum of Fibonacci numbers from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \) can be computed using the formula:
   \[
   S(N, K) = F(K+2) - F(N+1) - 1
   \]
   This means that we need to correctly compute \( F(K+2) \) and \( F(N+1) \).

2. **Identifying the Error**:
   The error in the previous code is likely due to the way the Fibonacci numbers are being computed. The Fibonacci function should return the correct Fibonacci number for the given index, but it seems that the output for the test case `1 1` returned `0` instead of `1`. 

   Specifically, the issue arises from the way the Fibonacci function is defined and how the indices are being handled. The Fibonacci function should return:
   - \( F(1) = 1 \)
   - \( F(2) = 1 \)
   - \( F(3) = 2 \)
   - \( F(4) = 3 \)
   - and so on.

   The formula for the sum \( S(N, K) \) should be correctly implemented to ensure that the indices are correctly adjusted.

3. **Correcting the Code**:
   We need to ensure that the Fibonacci function correctly computes the Fibonacci number for the given index. Additionally, we need to ensure that the sum calculation correctly uses the indices \( K+2 \) and \( N+1 \).

4. **Revising the Code**:
   We will revise the code to ensure that the Fibonacci function is correctly implemented and that the sum calculation is accurate.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def matrix_mult(A, B):
    return [[A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0], A[0][0] * B[0][1] + A[0][1] * B[1][1]],

def sum_fibonacci(N, K):
    # Calculate the sum from F(N) to F(K)

        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        result = sum_fibonacci(N, K)
        print(result)

main()
```

### Key Changes:
- The Fibonacci function now correctly computes \( F(n) \) for \( n \) directly, without subtracting 1 from the exponent in the matrix exponentiation.
- The sum calculation remains the same, but we ensure that the Fibonacci function is correctly returning the expected values.

This should resolve the issues and pass the tests correctly.

3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] 1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
   The task is to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from the N-th Fibonacci number to the K-th Fibonacci number for multiple queries. The Fibonacci sequence is defined such that the first two numbers are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Given the constraints, we need to handle very large values for N and K, which can go up to \(10^{18}\).

2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
   To efficiently compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers for large indices, we can use matrix exponentiation. The Fibonacci sequence can be represented using matrix multiplication, which allows us to compute Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time. The sum of Fibonacci numbers can be derived from the properties of the Fibonacci sequence:
   - The sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers can be expressed as \(F(n+2) - 1\).
   - Therefore, to find the sum from \(F(N)\) to \(F(K)\), we can compute:
     \[
     S(N, K) = F(K+2) - F(N+1) - 1
     \]
   This approach allows us to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently even for very large indices.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Fibonacci Sequence**:
   The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - \( F(0) = 0 \)
   - \( F(1) = 1 \)
   - \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \) for \( n \geq 2 \)

   The sum of Fibonacci numbers from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \) can be computed using the formula:
   \[
   S(N, K) = F(K+2) - F(N+1) - 1
   \]
   This means that we need to correctly compute \( F(K+2) \) and \( F(N+1) \).

2. **Identifying the Error**:
   The error in the previous code is likely due to the way the Fibonacci numbers are being computed. The Fibonacci function should return the correct Fibonacci number for the given index, but it seems that the output for the test case `1 1` returned `0` instead of `1`. 

   Specifically, the issue arises from the way the Fibonacci function is defined and how the indices are being handled. The Fibonacci function should return:
   - \( F(1) = 1 \)
   - \( F(2) = 1 \)
   - \( F(3) = 2 \)
   - \( F(4) = 3 \)
   - and so on.

   The formula for the sum \( S(N, K) \) should be correctly implemented to ensure that the indices are correctly adjusted.

3. **Correcting the Code**:
   We need to ensure that the Fibonacci function correctly computes the Fibonacci number for the given index. Additionally, we need to ensure that the sum calculation correctly uses the indices \( K+2 \) and \( N+1 \).

4. **Revising the Code**:
   We will revise the code to ensure that the Fibonacci function is correctly implemented and that the sum calculation is accurate.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def matrix_mult(A, B):
    return [[A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0], A[0][0] * B[0][1] + A[0][1] * B[1][1]],
            [A[1][0] * B[0][0] + A[1][1] * B[1][0], A[1][0] * B[0][1] + A[1][1] * B[1][1]]]

def matrix_pow(M, p):
    if p == 0:
        return [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Identity matrix
    if p == 1:
        return M
    half = matrix_pow(M, p // 2)
    half_squared = matrix_mult(half, half)
    if p % 2 == 0:
        return half_squared
    else:
        return matrix_mult(half_squared, M)

def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    F = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]
    result = matrix_pow(F, n)
    return result[0][0]  # F(n)

def sum_fibonacci(N, K):
    # Calculate the sum from F(N) to F(K)
    return (fibonacci(K + 2) - fibonacci(N + 1) - 1) % (10**9 + 7)

def main():
    Q = int(input())
    for _ in range(Q):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        result = sum_fibonacci(N, K)
        print(result)

main()
```

### Key Changes:
- The Fibonacci function now correctly computes \( F(n) \) for \( n \) directly, without subtracting 1 from the exponent in the matrix exponentiation.
- The sum calculation remains the same, but we ensure that the Fibonacci function is correctly returning the expected values.

This should resolve the issues and pass the tests correctly.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... for multiple test cases. Initially, I attempted to derive a formula for the series but mistakenly used an incorrect formula that did not correspond to the series, leading to incorrect outputs.

    Upon analyzing the series, I identified that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, which led to the realization that the N'th term could be computed as the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares. The correct formula for the N'th term is:
    - T(N) = (N-1) * N * (2(N-1) + 1) / 6

    This formula was derived from the known formula for the sum of squares. After implementing this corrected formula, the code produced the expected results for all test cases.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(N):
        if N == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1) // 6

    def main():
        T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N
            result = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            print(result)  # Output the result

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring that the derived formulas are correct before implementation.

[Summary]:
    The problem involved calculating the sum of squares of terms in the Golomb sequence for given ranges across multiple test cases. The Golomb sequence is defined recursively, which posed a challenge due to the potential size of the indices (up to \(10^{10}\)). 

    The key strategy was to use memoization to store previously computed values of the Golomb sequence to avoid redundant calculations. This approach allowed for efficient retrieval of values during the summation process. The recurrence relation \(G_{n+1} = 1 + G_{n + 1 - G_{G_n}}\) was utilized to compute the sequence values on-the-fly.

    The final implementation involved a main function to handle input and output, a `sum_of_squares` function to compute the required sums, and a `golomb` function to calculate individual Golomb numbers with memoization. The solution successfully handled the constraints and passed the provided test cases.

    Hereâ€™s the core code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def golomb(n, memo):
        if n in memo:
            return memo[n]
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        memo[n] = 1 + golomb(n - golomb(golomb(n - 1, memo), memo), memo)
        return memo[n]

    def sum_of_squares(L, R):
        memo = {}
        total_sum = 0
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        for i in range(L, R + 1):
            g_i = golomb(i, memo)
            total_sum = (total_sum + g_i * g_i) % mod
        return total_sum
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of memoization in recursive problems, especially when dealing with large input sizes.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of finding the last remaining number after filtering the last digits of Fibonacci numbers, I initially misunderstood the filtering process. I incorrectly assumed that the last remaining number would simply be the last digit of the Fibonacci number at position \(N-1\). This approach failed to account for the iterative filtering of the sequence, which significantly alters the numbers involved.

    The correct approach involved generating the last digits of the first \(N\) Fibonacci numbers and then applying the filtering process iteratively until only one number remained. This required careful handling of the sequence to ensure that only even-indexed elements were retained during each iteration.

    The final solution effectively combines these steps:

    1. **Generate Last Digits**: A function to compute the last digits of Fibonacci numbers up to \(N\).
    2. **Iterative Filtering**: A loop to filter the sequence until one number remains.
    3. **Input/Output Handling**: A main function to manage multiple test cases.

    The final code is as follows:

    ```python
    def last_digit_fibonacci_sequence(n):
        if n == 0:
            return [0]
        elif n == 1:
            return [0, 1]
    
        fib_digits = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            next_digit = (fib_digits[i - 1] + fib_digits[i - 2]) % 10
            fib_digits.append(next_digit)
        return fib_digits

    def find_last_remaining_number(N):
        D = last_digit_fibonacci_sequence(N)
        while len(D) > 1:
            D = [D[i] for i in range(1, len(D), 2)]
        return D[0]

    def main():
        T = int(input())
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            result = find_last_remaining_number(N)
            print(result)

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and the iterative nature of filtering processes in sequences.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In the year 4242, the language Haskell has evolved so much that it has become an AI. It can solve very challenging problems, in very little time. Humanity is worried that Haskell will take over the world. All hopes remain tied to the Competitive Programming community as they are the expert in shaving milliseconds off code runtime. Haskell creators have found one particular task that if solved faster than Haskell itself, can be used to hack into Haskell's codebase and thus defeat it. The exact details of the task are as follows,


" Calculate the sum, S(N, K) = , for Q queries. Here Fi is ith Fibonacci number defined as: Fi = i if i = 0 or 1 and Fi = Fi-1 + Fi-2 if i >= 2. "


You being a member of the Competitive Programming community are encouraged to make a submission to this task.

-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer Q, the number of queries.

Each of the next Q lines contain two integers each, Ni and Ki.

-----Output-----

Output Q lines with one integer each. The ith line should contain the value S(Ni, Ki).

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= Q <= 5*104
- 1 <= N <= 1018
- 1 <= K <= 1018

-----Example-----
Input:
1
1 1
Output:
1

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] 1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
   The task is to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from the N-th Fibonacci number to the K-th Fibonacci number for multiple queries. The Fibonacci sequence is defined such that the first two numbers are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Given the constraints, we need to handle very large values for N and K, which can go up to \(10^{18}\).

2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
   To efficiently compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers for large indices, we can use matrix exponentiation. The Fibonacci sequence can be represented using matrix multiplication, which allows us to compute Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time. The sum of Fibonacci numbers can be derived from the properties of the Fibonacci sequence:
   - The sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers can be expressed as \(F(n+2) - 1\).
   - Therefore, to find the sum from \(F(N)\) to \(F(K)\), we can compute:
     \[
     S(N, K) = F(K+2) - F(N+1) - 1
     \]
   This approach allows us to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently even for very large indices.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Fibonacci Sequence**:
   The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - \( F(0) = 0 \)
   - \( F(1) = 1 \)
   - \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \) for \( n \geq 2 \)

   The sum of Fibonacci numbers from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \) can be computed using the formula:
   \[
   S(N, K) = F(K+2) - F(N+1) - 1
   \]
   This means that we need to correctly compute \( F(K+2) \) and \( F(N+1) \).

2. **Identifying the Error**:
   The error in the previous code is likely due to the way the Fibonacci numbers are being computed. The Fibonacci function should return the correct Fibonacci number for the given index, but it seems that the output for the test case `1 1` returned `0` instead of `1`. 

   Specifically, the issue arises from the way the Fibonacci function is defined and how the indices are being handled. The Fibonacci function should return:
   - \( F(1) = 1 \)
   - \( F(2) = 1 \)
   - \( F(3) = 2 \)
   - \( F(4) = 3 \)
   - and so on.

   The formula for the sum \( S(N, K) \) should be correctly implemented to ensure that the indices are correctly adjusted.

3. **Correcting the Code**:
   We need to ensure that the Fibonacci function correctly computes the Fibonacci number for the given index. Additionally, we need to ensure that the sum calculation correctly uses the indices \( K+2 \) and \( N+1 \).

4. **Revising the Code**:
   We will revise the code to ensure that the Fibonacci function is correctly implemented and that the sum calculation is accurate.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def matrix_mult(A, B):
    return [[A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0], A[0][0] * B[0][1] + A[0][1] * B[1][1]],
            [A[1][0] * B[0][0] + A[1][1] * B[1][0], A[1][0] * B[0][1] + A[1][1] * B[1][1]]]

def matrix_pow(M, p):
    if p == 0:
        return [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Identity matrix
    if p == 1:
        return M
    half = matrix_pow(M, p // 2)
    half_squared = matrix_mult(half, half)
    if p % 2 == 0:
        return half_squared
    else:
        return matrix_mult(half_squared, M)

def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    F = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]
    result = matrix_pow(F, n)
    return result[0][0]  # F(n)

def sum_fibonacci(N, K):
    # Calculate the sum from F(N) to F(K)
    return (fibonacci(K + 2) - fibonacci(N + 1) - 1) % (10**9 + 7)

def main():
    Q = int(input())
    for _ in range(Q):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        result = sum_fibonacci(N, K)
        print(result)

main()
```

### Key Changes:
- The Fibonacci function now correctly computes \( F(n) \) for \( n \) directly, without subtracting 1 from the exponent in the matrix exponentiation.
- The sum calculation remains the same, but we ensure that the Fibonacci function is correctly returning the expected values.

This should resolve the issues and pass the tests correctly.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem again step-by-step to identify the issues in the code and understand why it is not producing the expected output.

1. **Understanding the Fibonacci Sequence**:
   The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - \( F(0) = 0 \)
   - \( F(1) = 1 \)
   - \( F(2) = 1 \)
   - \( F(3) = 2 \)
   - \( F(4) = 3 \)
   - \( F(5) = 5 \)
   - and so on.

   The sum of Fibonacci numbers from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \) can be computed using the formula:
   \[
   S(N, K) = F(K+2) - F(N+1) - 1
   \]
   This means that we need to compute \( F(K+2) \) and \( F(N+1) \) correctly.

2. **Identifying the Error**:
   The output for the test case `1 1` returned `0` instead of `1`. This indicates that the Fibonacci function is not returning the expected Fibonacci number for the given indices. 

   Specifically, when \( N = 1 \) and \( K = 1 \):
   - \( F(1) = 1 \)
   - \( F(2) = 1 \)
   - The expected sum \( S(1, 1) = F(1) = 1 \).

   However, using the formula:
   \[
   S(1, 1) = F(3) - F(2) - 1
   \]
   This results in:
   - \( F(3) = 2 \)
   - \( F(2) = 1 \)
   - Thus, \( S(1, 1) = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0 \), which is incorrect.

3. **Correcting the Formula**:
   The formula for the sum of Fibonacci numbers should be adjusted. The correct way to compute the sum from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \) is:
   \[
   S(N, K) = F(K+1) - F(N) 
   \]
   This means we need to compute:
   - \( F(K+1) \) and \( F(N) \).

4. **Revising the Code**:
   We will revise the code to ensure that the Fibonacci function is correctly implemented and that the sum calculation uses the correct formula.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python

### Key Changes:
- The sum calculation now uses the formula \( S(N, K) = F(K + 1) - F(N) \) to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \).
- The modulo operation is adjusted to ensure non-negative results.

This code should now correctly handle the input and output as specified in the problem statement and pass all test cases.

In the year 4242, the language Haskell has evolved so much that it has become an AI. It can solve very challenging problems, in very little time. Humanity is worried that Haskell will take over the world. All hopes remain tied to the Competitive Programming community as they are the expert in shaving milliseconds off code runtime. Haskell creators have found one particular task that if solved faster than Haskell itself, can be used to hack into Haskell's codebase and thus defeat it. The exact details of the task are as follows,


" Calculate the sum, S(N, K) = , for Q queries. Here Fi is ith Fibonacci number defined as: Fi = i if i = 0 or 1 and Fi = Fi-1 + Fi-2 if i >= 2. "

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] 1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
   The task is to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from the N-th Fibonacci number to the K-th Fibonacci number for multiple queries. The Fibonacci sequence is defined such that the first two numbers are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Given the constraints, we need to handle very large values for N and K, which can go up to \(10^{18}\).

2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
   To efficiently compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers for large indices, we can use matrix exponentiation. The Fibonacci sequence can be represented using matrix multiplication, which allows us to compute Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time. The sum of Fibonacci numbers can be derived from the properties of the Fibonacci sequence:
   - The sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers can be expressed as \(F(n+2) - 1\).
   - Therefore, to find the sum from \(F(N)\) to \(F(K)\), we can compute:
     \[
     S(N, K) = F(K+2) - F(N+1) - 1
     \]
   This approach allows us to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently even for very large indices.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Fibonacci Sequence**:
   The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - \( F(0) = 0 \)
   - \( F(1) = 1 \)
   - \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \) for \( n \geq 2 \)

   The sum of Fibonacci numbers from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \) can be computed using the formula:
   \[
   S(N, K) = F(K+2) - F(N+1) - 1
   \]
   This means that we need to correctly compute \( F(K+2) \) and \( F(N+1) \).

2. **Identifying the Error**:
   The error in the previous code is likely due to the way the Fibonacci numbers are being computed. The Fibonacci function should return the correct Fibonacci number for the given index, but it seems that the output for the test case `1 1` returned `0` instead of `1`. 

   Specifically, the issue arises from the way the Fibonacci function is defined and how the indices are being handled. The Fibonacci function should return:
   - \( F(1) = 1 \)
   - \( F(2) = 1 \)
   - \( F(3) = 2 \)
   - \( F(4) = 3 \)
   - and so on.

   The formula for the sum \( S(N, K) \) should be correctly implemented to ensure that the indices are correctly adjusted.

3. **Correcting the Code**:
   We need to ensure that the Fibonacci function correctly computes the Fibonacci number for the given index. Additionally, we need to ensure that the sum calculation correctly uses the indices \( K+2 \) and \( N+1 \).

4. **Revising the Code**:
   We will revise the code to ensure that the Fibonacci function is correctly implemented and that the sum calculation is accurate.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def matrix_mult(A, B):
    return [[A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0], A[0][0] * B[0][1] + A[0][1] * B[1][1]],
            [A[1][0] * B[0][0] + A[1][1] * B[1][0], A[1][0] * B[0][1] + A[1][1] * B[1][1]]]

def matrix_pow(M, p):
    if p == 0:
        return [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Identity matrix
    if p == 1:
        return M
    half = matrix_pow(M, p // 2)
    half_squared = matrix_mult(half, half)
    if p % 2 == 0:
        return half_squared
    else:
        return matrix_mult(half_squared, M)

def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    F = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]
    result = matrix_pow(F, n)
    return result[0][0]  # F(n)

def sum_fibonacci(N, K):
    # Calculate the sum from F(N) to F(K)
    return (fibonacci(K + 2) - fibonacci(N + 1) - 1) % (10**9 + 7)

def main():
    Q = int(input())
    for _ in range(Q):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        result = sum_fibonacci(N, K)
        print(result)

main()
```

### Key Changes:
- The Fibonacci function now correctly computes \( F(n) \) for \( n \) directly, without subtracting 1 from the exponent in the matrix exponentiation.
- The sum calculation remains the same, but we ensure that the Fibonacci function is correctly returning the expected values.

This should resolve the issues and pass the tests correctly.

### Key Changes:
- The Fibonacci function now correctly computes \( F(n) \) for \( n \) directly, ensuring that the correct Fibonacci number is returned.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem again step-by-step to identify the issues in the code and understand why it is not producing the expected output.

1. **Understanding the Fibonacci Sequence**:
   The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - \( F(0) = 0 \)
   - \( F(1) = 1 \)
   - \( F(2) = 1 \)
   - \( F(3) = 2 \)
   - \( F(4) = 3 \)
   - \( F(5) = 5 \)
   - and so on.

   The sum of Fibonacci numbers from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \) can be computed using the formula:
   \[
   S(N, K) = F(K+2) - F(N+1) - 1
   \]
   This means that we need to compute \( F(K+2) \) and \( F(N+1) \) correctly.

2. **Identifying the Error**:
   The output for the test case `1 1` returned `0` instead of `1`. This indicates that the Fibonacci function is not returning the expected Fibonacci number for the given indices. 

   Specifically, when \( N = 1 \) and \( K = 1 \):
   - \( F(1) = 1 \)
   - \( F(2) = 1 \)
   - The expected sum \( S(1, 1) = F(1) = 1 \).

   However, using the formula:
   \[
   S(1, 1) = F(3) - F(2) - 1
   \]
   This results in:
   - \( F(3) = 2 \)
   - \( F(2) = 1 \)
   - Thus, \( S(1, 1) = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0 \), which is incorrect.

3. **Correcting the Formula**:
   The formula for the sum of Fibonacci numbers should be adjusted. The correct way to compute the sum from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \) is:
   \[
   S(N, K) = F(K+1) - F(N) 
   \]
   This means we need to compute:
   - \( F(K+1) \) and \( F(N) \).

4. **Revising the Code**:
   We will revise the code to ensure that the Fibonacci function is correctly implemented and that the sum calculation uses the correct formula.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def matrix_mult(A, B):
    return [[A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0], A[0][0] * B[0][1] + A[0][1] * B[1][1]],
            [A[1][0] * B[0][0] + A[1][1] * B[1][0], A[1][0] * B[0][1] + A[1][1] * B[1][1]]]

### Key Changes:
- The sum calculation now uses the formula \( S(N, K) = F(K + 1) - F(N) \) to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \).
- The modulo operation is adjusted to ensure non-negative results.

This code should now correctly handle the input and output as specified in the problem statement and pass all test cases.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... for multiple test cases. Initially, I attempted to derive a formula for the series but mistakenly used an incorrect formula that did not correspond to the series, leading to incorrect outputs.

    Upon analyzing the series, I identified that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, which led to the realization that the N'th term could be computed as the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares. The correct formula for the N'th term is:
    - T(N) = (N-1) * N * (2(N-1) + 1) / 6

    This formula was derived from the known formula for the sum of squares. After implementing this corrected formula, the code produced the expected results for all test cases.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(N):
        if N == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            return (N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1) // 6

    def main():
        T = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())  # Read each test case value N
            result = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            print(result)  # Output the result

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring that the derived formulas are correct before implementation.

[Summary]:
    The problem involved calculating the sum of squares of terms in the Golomb sequence for given ranges across multiple test cases. The Golomb sequence is defined recursively, which posed a challenge due to the potential size of the indices (up to \(10^{10}\)). 

    The key strategy was to use memoization to store previously computed values of the Golomb sequence to avoid redundant calculations. This approach allowed for efficient retrieval of values during the summation process. The recurrence relation \(G_{n+1} = 1 + G_{n + 1 - G_{G_n}}\) was utilized to compute the sequence values on-the-fly.

    The final implementation involved a main function to handle input and output, a `sum_of_squares` function to compute the required sums, and a `golomb` function to calculate individual Golomb numbers with memoization. The solution successfully handled the constraints and passed the provided test cases.

    Hereâ€™s the core code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def golomb(n, memo):
        if n in memo:
            return memo[n]
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        memo[n] = 1 + golomb(n - golomb(golomb(n - 1, memo), memo), memo)
        return memo[n]

    def sum_of_squares(L, R):
        memo = {}
        total_sum = 0
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        for i in range(L, R + 1):
            g_i = golomb(i, memo)
            total_sum = (total_sum + g_i * g_i) % mod
        return total_sum
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of memoization in recursive problems, especially when dealing with large input sizes.

[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of finding the last remaining number after filtering the last digits of Fibonacci numbers, I initially misunderstood the filtering process. I incorrectly assumed that the last remaining number would simply be the last digit of the Fibonacci number at position \(N-1\). This approach failed to account for the iterative filtering of the sequence, which significantly alters the numbers involved.

    The correct approach involved generating the last digits of the first \(N\) Fibonacci numbers and then applying the filtering process iteratively until only one number remained. This required careful handling of the sequence to ensure that only even-indexed elements were retained during each iteration.

    The final solution effectively combines these steps:

    1. **Generate Last Digits**: A function to compute the last digits of Fibonacci numbers up to \(N\).
    2. **Iterative Filtering**: A loop to filter the sequence until one number remains.
    3. **Input/Output Handling**: A main function to manage multiple test cases.

    The final code is as follows:

    ```python
    def last_digit_fibonacci_sequence(n):
        if n == 0:
            return [0]
        elif n == 1:
            return [0, 1]
    
        fib_digits = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            next_digit = (fib_digits[i - 1] + fib_digits[i - 2]) % 10
            fib_digits.append(next_digit)
        return fib_digits

    def find_last_remaining_number(N):
        D = last_digit_fibonacci_sequence(N)
        while len(D) > 1:
            D = [D[i] for i in range(1, len(D), 2)]
        return D[0]

    def main():
        T = int(input())
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            result = find_last_remaining_number(N)
            print(result)

    main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and the iterative nature of filtering processes in sequences.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] 1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
   The task is to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from the N-th Fibonacci number to the K-th Fibonacci number for multiple queries. The Fibonacci sequence is defined such that the first two numbers are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Given the constraints, we need to handle very large values for N and K, which can go up to \(10^{18}\).

2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
   To efficiently compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers for large indices, we can use matrix exponentiation. The Fibonacci sequence can be represented using matrix multiplication, which allows us to compute Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time. The sum of Fibonacci numbers can be derived from the properties of the Fibonacci sequence:
   - The sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers can be expressed as \(F(n+2) - 1\).
   - Therefore, to find the sum from \(F(N)\) to \(F(K)\), we can compute:
     \[
     S(N, K) = F(K+2) - F(N+1) - 1
     \]
   This approach allows us to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently even for very large indices.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Fibonacci Sequence**:
   The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - \( F(0) = 0 \)
   - \( F(1) = 1 \)
   - \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \) for \( n \geq 2 \)

   The sum of Fibonacci numbers from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \) can be computed using the formula:
   \[
   S(N, K) = F(K+2) - F(N+1) - 1
   \]
   This means that we need to correctly compute \( F(K+2) \) and \( F(N+1) \).

2. **Identifying the Error**:
   The error in the previous code is likely due to the way the Fibonacci numbers are being computed. The Fibonacci function should return the correct Fibonacci number for the given index, but it seems that the output for the test case `1 1` returned `0` instead of `1`. 

   Specifically, the issue arises from the way the Fibonacci function is defined and how the indices are being handled. The Fibonacci function should return:
   - \( F(1) = 1 \)
   - \( F(2) = 1 \)
   - \( F(3) = 2 \)
   - \( F(4) = 3 \)
   - and so on.

   The formula for the sum \( S(N, K) \) should be correctly implemented to ensure that the indices are correctly adjusted.

3. **Correcting the Code**:
   We need to ensure that the Fibonacci function correctly computes the Fibonacci number for the given index. Additionally, we need to ensure that the sum calculation correctly uses the indices \( K+2 \) and \( N+1 \).

4. **Revising the Code**:
   We will revise the code to ensure that the Fibonacci function is correctly implemented and that the sum calculation is accurate.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def matrix_mult(A, B):
    return [[A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0], A[0][0] * B[0][1] + A[0][1] * B[1][1]],
            [A[1][0] * B[0][0] + A[1][1] * B[1][0], A[1][0] * B[0][1] + A[1][1] * B[1][1]]]

def matrix_pow(M, p):
    if p == 0:
        return [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Identity matrix
    if p == 1:
        return M
    half = matrix_pow(M, p // 2)
    half_squared = matrix_mult(half, half)
    if p % 2 == 0:
        return half_squared
    else:
        return matrix_mult(half_squared, M)

def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    F = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]
    result = matrix_pow(F, n)
    return result[0][0]  # F(n)

def sum_fibonacci(N, K):
    # Calculate the sum from F(N) to F(K)
    return (fibonacci(K + 2) - fibonacci(N + 1) - 1) % (10**9 + 7)

def main():
    Q = int(input())
    for _ in range(Q):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        result = sum_fibonacci(N, K)
        print(result)

main()
```

### Key Changes:
- The Fibonacci function now correctly computes \( F(n) \) for \( n \) directly, without subtracting 1 from the exponent in the matrix exponentiation.
- The sum calculation remains the same, but we ensure that the Fibonacci function is correctly returning the expected values.

This should resolve the issues and pass the tests correctly.

### Key Changes:
- The Fibonacci function now correctly computes \( F(n) \) for \( n \) directly, ensuring that the correct Fibonacci number is returned.
- The sum calculation uses the formula \( S(N, K) = F(K + 2) - F(N + 1) - 1 \) to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \).

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem again step-by-step to identify the issues in the code and understand why it is not producing the expected output.

1. **Understanding the Fibonacci Sequence**:
   The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - \( F(0) = 0 \)
   - \( F(1) = 1 \)
   - \( F(2) = 1 \)
   - \( F(3) = 2 \)
   - \( F(4) = 3 \)
   - \( F(5) = 5 \)
   - and so on.

   The sum of Fibonacci numbers from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \) can be computed using the formula:
   \[
   S(N, K) = F(K+2) - F(N+1) - 1
   \]
   This means that we need to compute \( F(K+2) \) and \( F(N+1) \) correctly.

2. **Identifying the Error**:
   The output for the test case `1 1` returned `0` instead of `1`. This indicates that the Fibonacci function is not returning the expected Fibonacci number for the given indices. 

   Specifically, when \( N = 1 \) and \( K = 1 \):
   - \( F(1) = 1 \)
   - \( F(2) = 1 \)
   - The expected sum \( S(1, 1) = F(1) = 1 \).

   However, using the formula:
   \[
   S(1, 1) = F(3) - F(2) - 1
   \]
   This results in:
   - \( F(3) = 2 \)
   - \( F(2) = 1 \)
   - Thus, \( S(1, 1) = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0 \), which is incorrect.

3. **Correcting the Formula**:
   The formula for the sum of Fibonacci numbers should be adjusted. The correct way to compute the sum from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \) is:
   \[
   S(N, K) = F(K+1) - F(N) 
   \]
   This means we need to compute:
   - \( F(K+1) \) and \( F(N) \).

4. **Revising the Code**:
   We will revise the code to ensure that the Fibonacci function is correctly implemented and that the sum calculation uses the correct formula.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def matrix_mult(A, B):
    return [[A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0], A[0][0] * B[0][1] + A[0][1] * B[1][1]],
            [A[1][0] * B[0][0] + A[1][1] * B[1][0], A[1][0] * B[0][1] + A[1][1] * B[1][1]]]

def matrix_pow(M, p):
    if p == 0:
        return [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Identity matrix
    if p == 1:
        return M
    half = matrix_pow(M, p // 2)
    half_squared = matrix_mult(half, half)
    if p % 2 == 0:
        return half_squared
    else:
        return matrix_mult(half_squared, M)

def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    F = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]
    result = matrix_pow(F, n)
    return result[0][0]  # F(n)

def sum_fibonacci(N, K):
    # Calculate the sum from F(N) to F(K)
    return (fibonacci(K + 1) - fibonacci(N) + (10**9 + 7)) % (10**9 + 7)

        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        result = sum_fibonacci(N, K)
        print(result)

main()
```

### Key Changes:
- The sum calculation now uses the formula \( S(N, K) = F(K + 1) - F(N) \) to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \).
- The modulo operation is adjusted to ensure non-negative results.

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Matrix Multiplication and Exponentiation**: The `matrix_mult` and `matrix_pow` functions are used to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently using matrix exponentiation.
- **Fibonacci Function**: The `fibonacci` function computes the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number using matrix exponentiation.
- **Sum Calculation**: The `sum_fibonacci` function calculates the sum of Fibonacci numbers from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \) using the corrected formula.
- **Main Function**: The `main` function handles input and output for multiple queries.

This code should now correctly compute the required sums of Fibonacci numbers for each query and pass all test cases.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] In solving the problem of calculating the sum of Fibonacci numbers from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \) for multiple queries, the key concepts involved were matrix exponentiation for efficient Fibonacci number computation and understanding the properties of the Fibonacci sequence.

Initially, the approach used the formula \( S(N, K) = F(K + 2) - F(N + 1) - 1 \), which led to incorrect results for certain test cases. The error stemmed from miscalculating the indices for the Fibonacci numbers. The correct formula for the sum of Fibonacci numbers from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \) is \( S(N, K) = F(K + 1) - F(N) \). This adjustment was crucial for obtaining the correct outputs.

The final implementation utilized matrix exponentiation to compute Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time, which is essential given the constraints (up to \( 10^{18} \)). The code structure included functions for matrix multiplication, matrix exponentiation, and a dedicated Fibonacci function, followed by a main function to handle input and output.

    if p % 2 == 0:
        return half_squared
    else:
        return matrix_mult(half_squared, M)

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] 1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:
   The task is to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from the N-th Fibonacci number to the K-th Fibonacci number for multiple queries. The Fibonacci sequence is defined such that the first two numbers are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Given the constraints, we need to handle very large values for N and K, which can go up to \(10^{18}\).

2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:
   To efficiently compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers for large indices, we can use matrix exponentiation. The Fibonacci sequence can be represented using matrix multiplication, which allows us to compute Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time. The sum of Fibonacci numbers can be derived from the properties of the Fibonacci sequence:
   - The sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers can be expressed as \(F(n+2) - 1\).
   - Therefore, to find the sum from \(F(N)\) to \(F(K)\), we can compute:
     \[
     S(N, K) = F(K+2) - F(N+1) - 1
     \]
   This approach allows us to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently even for very large indices.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Fibonacci Sequence**:
   The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - \( F(0) = 0 \)
   - \( F(1) = 1 \)
   - \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \) for \( n \geq 2 \)

   The sum of Fibonacci numbers from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \) can be computed using the formula:
   \[
   S(N, K) = F(K+2) - F(N+1) - 1
   \]
   This means that we need to correctly compute \( F(K+2) \) and \( F(N+1) \).

2. **Identifying the Error**:
   The error in the previous code is likely due to the way the Fibonacci numbers are being computed. The Fibonacci function should return the correct Fibonacci number for the given index, but it seems that the output for the test case `1 1` returned `0` instead of `1`. 

   Specifically, the issue arises from the way the Fibonacci function is defined and how the indices are being handled. The Fibonacci function should return:
   - \( F(1) = 1 \)
   - \( F(2) = 1 \)
   - \( F(3) = 2 \)
   - \( F(4) = 3 \)
   - and so on.

   The formula for the sum \( S(N, K) \) should be correctly implemented to ensure that the indices are correctly adjusted.

3. **Correcting the Code**:
   We need to ensure that the Fibonacci function correctly computes the Fibonacci number for the given index. Additionally, we need to ensure that the sum calculation correctly uses the indices \( K+2 \) and \( N+1 \).

4. **Revising the Code**:
   We will revise the code to ensure that the Fibonacci function is correctly implemented and that the sum calculation is accurate.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def matrix_mult(A, B):
    return [[A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0], A[0][0] * B[0][1] + A[0][1] * B[1][1]],
            [A[1][0] * B[0][0] + A[1][1] * B[1][0], A[1][0] * B[0][1] + A[1][1] * B[1][1]]]

def matrix_pow(M, p):
    if p == 0:
        return [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Identity matrix
    if p == 1:
        return M
    half = matrix_pow(M, p // 2)
    half_squared = matrix_mult(half, half)
    if p % 2 == 0:
        return half_squared
    else:
        return matrix_mult(half_squared, M)

def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    F = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]
    result = matrix_pow(F, n)
    return result[0][0]  # F(n)

def sum_fibonacci(N, K):
    # Calculate the sum from F(N) to F(K)
    return (fibonacci(K + 2) - fibonacci(N + 1) - 1) % (10**9 + 7)

def main():
    Q = int(input())
    for _ in range(Q):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        result = sum_fibonacci(N, K)
        print(result)

main()
```

### Key Changes:
- The Fibonacci function now correctly computes \( F(n) \) for \( n \) directly, without subtracting 1 from the exponent in the matrix exponentiation.
- The sum calculation remains the same, but we ensure that the Fibonacci function is correctly returning the expected values.

This should resolve the issues and pass the tests correctly.

### Key Changes:
- The Fibonacci function now correctly computes \( F(n) \) for \( n \) directly, ensuring that the correct Fibonacci number is returned.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem again step-by-step to identify the issues in the code and understand why it is not producing the expected output.

1. **Understanding the Fibonacci Sequence**:
   The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - \( F(0) = 0 \)
   - \( F(1) = 1 \)
   - \( F(2) = 1 \)
   - \( F(3) = 2 \)
   - \( F(4) = 3 \)
   - \( F(5) = 5 \)
   - and so on.

   The sum of Fibonacci numbers from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \) can be computed using the formula:
   \[
   S(N, K) = F(K+2) - F(N+1) - 1
   \]
   This means that we need to compute \( F(K+2) \) and \( F(N+1) \) correctly.

2. **Identifying the Error**:
   The output for the test case `1 1` returned `0` instead of `1`. This indicates that the Fibonacci function is not returning the expected Fibonacci number for the given indices. 

   Specifically, when \( N = 1 \) and \( K = 1 \):
   - \( F(1) = 1 \)
   - \( F(2) = 1 \)
   - The expected sum \( S(1, 1) = F(1) = 1 \).

   However, using the formula:
   \[
   S(1, 1) = F(3) - F(2) - 1
   \]
   This results in:
   - \( F(3) = 2 \)
   - \( F(2) = 1 \)
   - Thus, \( S(1, 1) = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0 \), which is incorrect.

3. **Correcting the Formula**:
   The formula for the sum of Fibonacci numbers should be adjusted. The correct way to compute the sum from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \) is:
   \[
   S(N, K) = F(K+1) - F(N) 
   \]
   This means we need to compute:
   - \( F(K+1) \) and \( F(N) \).

4. **Revising the Code**:
   We will revise the code to ensure that the Fibonacci function is correctly implemented and that the sum calculation uses the correct formula.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def matrix_mult(A, B):
    return [[A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0], A[0][0] * B[0][1] + A[0][1] * B[1][1]],
            [A[1][0] * B[0][0] + A[1][1] * B[1][0], A[1][0] * B[0][1] + A[1][1] * B[1][1]]]

def matrix_pow(M, p):
    if p == 0:
        return [[1, 0], [0, 1]]  # Identity matrix
    if p == 1:
        return M
    half = matrix_pow(M, p // 2)
    half_squared = matrix_mult(half, half)
    if p % 2 == 0:
        return half_squared
    else:
        return matrix_mult(half_squared, M)

def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    F = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]
    result = matrix_pow(F, n)
    return result[0][0]  # F(n)

def sum_fibonacci(N, K):
    # Calculate the sum from F(N) to F(K)
    return (fibonacci(K + 1) - fibonacci(N) + (10**9 + 7)) % (10**9 + 7)

        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        result = sum_fibonacci(N, K)
        print(result)

main()
```

### Key Changes:
- The sum calculation now uses the formula \( S(N, K) = F(K + 1) - F(N) \) to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \).
- The modulo operation is adjusted to ensure non-negative results.

        result = sum_fibonacci(N, K)
        print(result)

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Matrix Multiplication and Exponentiation**: The `matrix_mult` and `matrix_pow` functions are used to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently using matrix exponentiation.
- **Fibonacci Function**: The `fibonacci` function computes the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number using matrix exponentiation.
- **Sum Calculation**: The `sum_fibonacci` function calculates the sum of Fibonacci numbers from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \) using the corrected formula.
- **Main Function**: The `main` function handles input and output for multiple queries.

This code should now correctly compute the required sums of Fibonacci numbers for each query and pass all test cases.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience

In attempting to solve the problem of calculating the sum of Fibonacci numbers from \( F(N) \) to \( F(K) \), I initially approached it using matrix exponentiation, which is a common technique for efficiently computing Fibonacci numbers. However, my solution faced issues with the formula used for summing the Fibonacci numbers, leading to incorrect outputs for certain test cases.

The official solution provided a more nuanced approach that leverages both the properties of Fibonacci numbers and modular arithmetic. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Fibonacci Calculation**: The official solution uses a recursive method to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently. The function `_fib(n)` computes Fibonacci numbers using a divide-and-conquer approach, which is more efficient than the matrix exponentiation method I used. This method reduces the time complexity significantly by breaking down the problem recursively.

2. **Modular Arithmetic**: The official solution consistently applies modular arithmetic to ensure that the results remain within bounds, which is crucial given the constraints of the problem. This is done using a modulus value of \( 10^9 + 7 \).

3. **Sum Calculation**: The official solution includes a `brute` function that calculates the sum of Fibonacci numbers multiplied by powers of \( k \). This is a different approach than my initial attempt, which focused solely on the range of Fibonacci numbers without considering the multiplicative factor of \( k \).

4. **Final Answer Calculation**: The `ans` function in the official solution combines the results of the Fibonacci calculations and applies the modular inverse to ensure the final result is computed correctly. This step is crucial for handling cases where division is involved in modular arithmetic.

### Key Code Snippets from the Official Solution
- **Fibonacci Calculation**:
    ```python
    def _fib(n):
        if n == 0:
            return (0, 1)
        else:
            a, b = _fib(n // 2)
            c = (a * (b * 2 - a)) % mod
            d = (a * a + b * b) % mod
            if n % 2 == 0:
                return (c, d)
            else:
                return (d, c + d)
    ```

- **Sum Calculation**:
    ```python
    def ans(n, k):
        k %= mod
        a = pow(k, n + 1, mod)
        b = (a * k) % mod
        x = a * (fibonacci(n + 1)) + b * fibonacci(n) - k
        y = inv((k * k + k - 1) % mod)
        return ((x * y) % mod + mod) % mod
    ```

### Conclusion
This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the mathematical properties of the problem and how they can be leveraged to create efficient algorithms. The official solution's use of recursive Fibonacci calculation and modular arithmetic provided a more effective approach than my initial attempt. In future problems, I will pay closer attention to the mathematical foundations and consider multiple approaches to ensure robustness in my solutions.
