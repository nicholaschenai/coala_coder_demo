## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Help Saurabh with his Chemistry Assignment.

Saurabh has been given a chemistry assignment by Ruby Mam. Though the assignment is simple but

Saurabh has to watch India vs Pakistan Match and he has no time to do the assignment by himself.

So Saurabh wants you to do his assignment so that he doesnâ€™t get scolded by Ruby Mam . The assignment

is as follows , Suppose there are X particles initially at time t=0 in a box. At a time t the number of particles in

box becomes t times the number of particles at time t-1 . You will be given N and X where N is time at which the

number of particles in box is to be calculated and X is the number of particles at time t=0.

-----Input-----
The first line will contain the integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two space

separated integers N and X .

-----Output-----
For each test case, output the answer to the query. Since the output can be very large, output the answer modulo

10^6+3

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 100000
- 1 â‰¤ N,X â‰¤ 10^18

-----Example-----
Input:
2
1 2
2 1

Output:
2
2

-----Explanation-----
Example case 2.At t=0 particles are 1 ,so at t=1 ,particles are 1*1 = 1 particles. At t=2, particles are 2*1 = 2 particles.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1032 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Saurabh needs to calculate the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. The number of particles at time `t` is determined by multiplying the number of particles at time `t-1` by `t`. The results can be very large, so we need to return the result modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve the problem, we need to compute the number of particles at time `N` based on the formula:
   - At `t=0`, particles = `X`
   - At `t=1`, particles = `1 * X`
   - At `t=2`, particles = `2 * (1 * X)`
   - At `t=3`, particles = `3 * (2 * (1 * X))`
   - And so on, until `t=N`.
   
   This can be simplified to:
   - Particles at time `N` = `X * N!` (N factorial).
   
   However, since `N` can be very large (up to \(10^{18}\)), calculating `N!` directly is impractical. Instead, we can use properties of modular arithmetic and the fact that \(N! \mod (10^6 + 3)\) will repeat after a certain point due to the factorial growth and the modulus.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function calculate_particles(N, X):
       MOD = 1000003
       if N >= MOD:
           return 0  // because N! will have MOD as a factor
       factorial = 1
       for i from 1 to N:
           factorial = (factorial * i) % MOD
       return (factorial * X) % MOD

   function main():
       read T
       for each test case:
           read N, X
           result = calculate_particles(N, X)
           print result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def calculate_particles(N, X):
    MOD = 1000003
    # If N is greater than or equal to MOD, the result will be 0
    if N >= MOD:
        return 0  # because N! will have MOD as a factor
    factorial = 1
    # Calculate N! % MOD
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        factorial = (factorial * i) % MOD
    # Return (N! * X) % MOD
    return (factorial * X) % MOD

def main():

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues:

        1. **Understanding the Problem**:
           The goal is to find out how many times all three groups of students (first, second, and third years) will be present together on campus over a specified number of days (N). They arrive at intervals of x, y, and z hours respectively. We need to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of these intervals to determine how often they coincide.

        2. **Identifying the Issue**:
           The code calculates the LCM correctly, but the counting of days where all three groups are present is done using integer division (`N // lcm_value`). This approach assumes that the LCM is in hours, but we need to consider that the total number of hours in N days is `N * 24` (since there are 24 hours in a day). Therefore, we should be dividing `N * 24` by the LCM to get the correct count of days.

        3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
           - I did not account for the conversion from days to hours when calculating how many times the LCM fits into the total hours available in N days.
           - The calculation of `N // lcm_value` should actually be `N * 24 // lcm_value`.

        Now, let's correct the code accordingly.

        ```python
        def gcd(a, b):
            # Function to compute the greatest common divisor
            while b != 0:
                a, b = b, a % b
            return a

        def lcm(a, b):
            # Function to compute the least common multiple
            return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

        def calculate_lcm(x, y, z):
            # Function to compute the LCM of three numbers
            return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)

        def count_days(N, x, y, z):
            # Count how many days all three groups are present
            lcm_value = calculate_lcm(x, y, z)
            # Calculate total hours in N days
            total_hours = N * 24
            # Return the number of times the LCM fits into the total hours
            return total_hours // lcm_value

        def main(T):
            for _ in range(T):
                # Read number of days
                N = int(input())
                # Read the intervals for the three groups
                x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
                # Calculate the result
                result = count_days(N, x, y, z)
                # Print the result
                print(result)

        # Read number of test cases
        T = int(input())
        main(T)
        ``` 

        This corrected code now properly calculates the number of times all three groups of students will be present together by considering the total hours in N days.
    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        Here is the corrected Python code for the original problem, ensuring that we account for the total hours in N days when calculating how many times all three groups of students will be present together:

        ```python
        def gcd(a, b):
            # Function to compute the greatest common divisor
            while b != 0:
                a, b = b, a % b
            return a

        def lcm(a, b):
            # Function to compute the least common multiple
            return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

        def calculate_lcm(x, y, z):
            # Function to compute the LCM of three numbers
            return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)

        def count_days(N, x, y, z):
            # Count how many days all three groups are present
            lcm_value = calculate_lcm(x, y, z)
            # Calculate total hours in N days
            total_hours = N * 24
            # Return the number of times the LCM fits into the total hours
            return total_hours // lcm_value

        def main(T):
            for _ in range(T):
                # Read number of days
                N = int(input())
                # Read the intervals for the three groups
                x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
                # Calculate the result
                result = count_days(N, x, y, z)
                # Print the result
                print(result)

        # Read number of test cases
        T = int(input())
        main(T)
        ``` 

        This code correctly calculates the number of times all three groups of students will be present together by considering the total hours available in N days.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
           The problem requires us to determine how many times first, second, and third-year students will all be present on campus together over a given number of days. Each group of students arrives at specific intervals (every x, y, and z hours respectively). We need to find the number of days within a specified range where all three groups are present simultaneously.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           - For each test case, read the number of days (N) and the intervals (x, y, z) for the three groups of students.
           - To find the days when all three groups are present, we need to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals (x, y, z). This will give us the frequency at which all three groups will be present together.
           - Count how many multiples of this LCM fit within the range of days (1 to N).

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine how many times first, second, and third-year students would all be present on campus together over a specified number of days (N). Each group arrives at specific intervals (x, y, z hours). The key concept was to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of these intervals to find out how often they coincide.

    Initially, the code correctly calculated the LCM but failed to account for the total hours in N days. The mistake was in using `N // lcm_value` instead of `N * 24 // lcm_value`, which led to incorrect results. This error was identified during testing when the output did not match expectations.

    The final solution involved defining helper functions for calculating the GCD and LCM, and then using these to count the number of times all three groups would be present by dividing the total hours in N days by the LCM. The corrected code successfully passed all test cases.

    Key code snippets:
    ```python
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b != 0:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a

    def lcm(a, b):
        return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

    def count_days(N, x, y, z):
        lcm_value = calculate_lcm(x, y, z)
        total_hours = N * 24
        return total_hours // lcm_value
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering units and conversions in calculations, especially when dealing with time intervals.

INFO - [Task id] 1032 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to calculate how many particles are present in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. The number of particles at time `t` is determined by multiplying the number of particles at time `t-1` by `t`. The output should be the number of particles at time `N`, modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each test case, read the values of `N` (the time) and `X` (the initial number of particles).
   - The number of particles at time `t` can be expressed as \(X \times (1 \times 2 \times ... \times N)\), which is \(X\) multiplied by the factorial of `N`.
   - Since `N` can be very large (up to \(10^{18}\)), calculating the factorial directly is impractical. Instead, we can use properties of modular arithmetic to compute the result efficiently.
   - Specifically, we can compute the factorial modulo \(10^6 + 3\) and then multiply it by `X`, also taking the result modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

INFO - [Task id] 1032 [generation text] In this task, I was required to calculate the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. The challenge was to compute the result efficiently, especially since `N` could be as large as \(10^{18}\). The key insight was recognizing that the factorial of `N` would grow rapidly, and thus, calculating it directly was impractical. Instead, I utilized modular arithmetic to keep the calculations manageable.

The solution involved defining two main functions: one for calculating the factorial modulo \(10^6 + 3\) and another for computing the number of particles based on the factorial and the initial count `X`. A critical optimization was to return `0` if `N` was greater than or equal to \(10^6 + 3\), as the factorial would be `0` in that case.

The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was sound, as evidenced by passing the provided test cases. The code structure was clear, with helper functions defined before the main logic, adhering to best practices in programming. 

Key code snippets:
```python
def factorial_mod(n, mod):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result = (result * i) % mod
    return result

def calculate_particles(N, X):
    mod = 1000003
    if N >= mod:
        return 0
    factorial_value = factorial_mod(N, mod)
    return (factorial_value * X) % mod
``` 

This experience reinforced the importance of modular arithmetic in handling large numbers and the need for efficient algorithms in competitive programming contexts.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
a = [1]
M = 10**6 + 3
for ii in range(1, 1000005):
 a.append((a[-1]*ii)%M)
for __ in range(eval(input())):
 n, x = list(map(int, input().split()))
 if n>=M: print(0)
 else: print((a[n]*x)%M)


INFO - [Task id] 1032 [generation text] The official solution employs a precomputation strategy to efficiently handle the factorial calculations modulo \(10^6 + 3\). Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Precomputation of Factorials**: The solution initializes a list `a` to store the factorial values modulo \(10^6 + 3\) for all integers from 0 to 1,000,004. This allows for O(1) retrieval of factorial values during each test case, significantly speeding up the process compared to calculating the factorial on-the-fly.

2. **Handling Large N**: The solution checks if `N` is greater than or equal to \(10^6 + 3\). If it is, the output is immediately set to 0, as the factorial will be 0 modulo \(10^6 + 3\) for any `N` that meets this condition. This is a crucial optimization that avoids unnecessary calculations.

3. **Efficiency**: By precomputing the factorials, the solution reduces the time complexity for each test case to O(1) after an initial O(M) setup time, where M is \(10^6 + 3\). This is particularly effective given the constraints of up to 100,000 test cases.

In contrast, my initial approach involved calculating the factorial for each test case, which could lead to inefficiencies, especially for large values of `N`. The use of modular arithmetic was correct, but the lack of precomputation made it less efficient. 

Overall, the official solution's strategy of precomputing factorials and leveraging modular properties is a more effective approach for this problem, especially given the constraints. This experience highlights the importance of considering precomputation in problems involving repeated calculations.
