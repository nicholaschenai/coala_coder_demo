    "raw_msg": "Given the previous analysis and the insights gained, I will revise the solution to ensure it correctly handles the task of minimizing uncompleted tasks. The key points to address are:\n\n1. Properly using black buttons to increase completed tasks without exceeding the planned tasks.\n2. Using white buttons to reduce planned tasks optimally.\n3. Correctly calculating the total uncompleted tasks after processing all days.\n\nHere\u2019s the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef min_uncompleted_tasks(T):\n    for _ in range(T):\n        # Read the number of days, white buttons, and black buttons\n        N, K, M = map(int, input().split())\n        # Read the planned tasks for each day\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        # Read the completed tasks for each day\n        B = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        # Read the values on the white buttons\n        C = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        # Read the values on the black buttons\n        D = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n        # Sort the white and black buttons in descending order\n        C.sort(reverse=True)\n        D.sort(reverse=True)\n        \n        total_uncompleted = 0\n        \n        for day in range(N):\n            # Calculate remaining tasks for the day\n            remaining_tasks = A[day] - B[day]\n            \n            # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks\n            for button in D:\n                if remaining_tasks > 0 and B[day] < A[day]:\n                    can_add = min(button, A[day] - B[day])\n                    B[day] += can_add\n                    remaining_tasks -= can_add\n            \n            # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks\n            for button in C:\n                if A[day] > 0:\n                    can_reduce = min(button, A[day])\n                    A[day] -= can_reduce\n            \n            # Calculate total uncompleted tasks\n            total_uncompleted += max(0, A[day] - B[day])\n        \n        # Output the total uncompleted tasks\n        print(total_uncompleted)\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nmin_uncompleted_tasks(T)\n```\n\n### Key Changes Made:\n- The logic for using black buttons now correctly checks if adding the button's value to the completed tasks exceeds the planned tasks.\n- The code now uses `min(button, A[day] - B[day])` to ensure that we do not exceed the planned tasks when using black buttons.\n- The calculation of total uncompleted tasks is done using `max(0, A[day] - B[day])` to ensure we do not end up with negative uncompleted tasks.\n\nThis implementation should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks after all days.",
