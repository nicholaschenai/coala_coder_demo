He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.\nThe good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! \nThe Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.\nPressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.\nPressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.\nChef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?\nBe careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains three integers \u2014 N, K, M \u2014 denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.\n- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, \u2026 , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.\n- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, \u2026 , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.\n- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, \u2026 , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.\n- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, \u2026 , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.\n\n-----Output-----\n- In a single line, output an integer \u2014 the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 4\n- 1 \u2264 N, K, M \u2264 10^5\n- 1 \u2264 Bi \u2264 Ai  \u2264 10^5\n- 1 \u2264 Ci, Di  \u2264 10^5\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask N \u2264 10, K, M \u2264 5.

He has access to a Time Machine with buttons that can either reduce the number of planned tasks or increase the number of completed tasks. The goal is to minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally over the given days.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   For each day, we need to determine how many tasks Chef can complete using the buttons.

The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the available days to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging simple loops and arithmetic.\n\n    The final implementation was clean and efficient, successfully passing all provided test cases. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all edge cases (like having fewer problems than needed for a single contest) are considered. The solution was implemented without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints given. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_contests(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    max_contests(T)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of clear problem understanding and systematic solution development.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to calculate the number of valid schedules for Chef's restaurant, where dishes must be served over \\(N\\) days with specific constraints: consecutive days must have different dishes, and the first and last dishes must also be different.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    1. **Understanding the Combinatorial Nature**: The problem required a combinatorial approach to count valid arrangements based on the number of days. The choices for each day depended on the previous day's choice, leading to a recursive pattern.\n\n    2. **Formulating the Correct Logic**:\n       - For \\(N = 2\\): The valid combinations are \\(4 \\times 3\\).\n       - For \\(N = 3\\): The valid combinations are \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 2\\).\n       - For \\(N \\geq 4\\): The correct formula should be \\(4 \\times 3^{(N-1)}\\) because:\n         - The first day has 4 choices.\n         - The second day has 3 choices.\n         - Each of the next \\(N-2\\) days has 3 choices.\n         - The last day must be different from the first dish, which is already accounted for in the choices.\n\n    ### Errors and Fixes:\n    - Initially, I miscalculated the formula for \\(N \\geq 4\\) by incorrectly considering the last dish's constraints. The correct approach was to ensure that the last dish is different from the first while maintaining the choices for the middle days.\n    - The final formula for \\(N \\geq 4\\) was adjusted to correctly reflect the choices available.\n\n    ### Final Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def calculate_schedules(N):\n        if N == 2:\n            return (4 * 3) % (10**9 + 7)\n        elif N == 3:\n            return (4 * 3 * 2) % (10**9 + 7)\n        else:\n            return (4 * 3 * (3 ** (N - 2))) % (10**9 + 7)\n\n    def main():\n        T = int(input())\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            result = calculate_schedules(N)\n            print(result)\n\n    main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering constraints in combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accurately reflected in the formulas used.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money (K) to N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money, such that he ends up with exactly zero. The key insights were that if the total demand from all minions exceeds K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and if the total demand equals K, he can distribute the money exactly.\n\n    Initially, I implemented a solution that simply checked if the total demand was greater than, equal to, or less than K. However, this approach failed to account for the scenario where the total demand was less than K but could still be distributed in a way that Gru ends up with zero. The logic needed to ensure that Gru could fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.\n\n    The correct approach involves:\n    1. Calculating the total demand.\n    2. Checking if the total demand exceeds K (output \"NO\").\n    3. If the total demand equals K, output \"YES\".\n    4. If the total demand is less than K, output \"NO\" since Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.\n\n    The final code snippet that captures this logic is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, input().split())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n            total_demand = sum(A)\n        \n            if total_demand > K:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            elif total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    can_distribute_money(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the conditions under which money can be distributed and ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the available days to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging simple loops and arithmetic.\n\n    The final implementation was clean and efficient, successfully passing all provided test cases. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all edge cases (like having fewer problems than needed for a single contest) are considered. The solution was implemented without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints given. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_contests(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    max_contests(T)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of clear problem understanding and systematic solution development.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element by its index any number of times. The key insight was that the total sum of the sequence must be less than or equal to the maximum possible reduction, and it must also be non-negative to reach zero.\n\n    Initially, the solution incorrectly assumed that if the total sum was less than or equal to the maximum reduction, it could always be made zero. This was a flawed assumption because it did not account for the possibility of the total sum being negative, which would make it impossible to reach zero.\n\n    The corrected approach involved:\n    1. Calculating the total sum of the sequence.\n    2. Calculating the maximum reduction possible using the formula for the sum of the first `N` natural numbers.\n    3. Checking both conditions: the total sum must be less than or equal to the maximum reduction and must be non-negative.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total_sum = sum(A)\n            max_reduction = sum(range(1, N + 1))\n        \n            if total_sum <= max_reduction and total_sum >= 0:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    can_make_good_sequence(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all conditions that affect the outcome, especially when dealing with sums and reductions.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money (K) to N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money, such that he ends up with exactly zero. The key insights were that if the total demand from all minions exceeds K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and if the total demand equals K, he can distribute the money exactly.\n\n    Initially, I implemented a solution that simply checked if the total demand was greater than, equal to, or less than K. However, this approach failed to account for the scenario where the total demand was less than K but could still be distributed in a way that Gru ends up with zero. The logic needed to ensure that Gru could fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.\n\n    The correct approach involves:\n    1. Calculating the total demand.\n    2. Checking if the total demand exceeds K (output \"NO\").\n    3. If the total demand equals K, output \"YES\".\n    4. If the total demand is less than K, output \"NO\" since Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.\n\n    The final code snippet that captures this logic is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, input().split())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n            total_demand = sum(A)\n        \n            if total_demand > K:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            elif total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    can_distribute_money(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the conditions under which money can be distributed and ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n- **Difference Calculation**: The official solution first calculates the difference between planned tasks and completed tasks for each day, storing these in a list. This allows for a clear understanding of how many tasks remain uncompleted after each day.\n\n- **Combining Button Values**: The solution combines the values of both black and white buttons into a single list and sorts it. This allows for efficient usage of the buttons in descending order, ensuring that the largest available adjustments are made first.\n\n- **Greedy Approach**: The official solution employs a greedy strategy where it iterates through the sorted list of remaining tasks and attempts to reduce them using the largest available button values. This ensures that the most significant reductions are made first, leading to an optimal solution.\n\n- **Efficient Looping**: The nested loops in the official solution are structured to ensure that each button is used optimally without exceeding the constraints, which I failed to implement correctly in my approach.\n\nOverall, the official solution's approach to sorting and using a greedy algorithm provides a more effective way to minimize uncompleted tasks, highlighting the importance of careful management of constraints and efficient use of resources in problem-solving."
