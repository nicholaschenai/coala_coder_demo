    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   Chef has a number of tasks planned over several days, but he can use buttons from a Time Machine to adjust the number of tasks he has to complete. There are two types of buttons: white buttons that reduce the planned tasks and black buttons that increase the completed tasks. The goal is to determine the minimum number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally over all days.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   - For each day, calculate how many tasks are left after considering the completed tasks.\n   - Use the black buttons to maximize the completed tasks without exceeding the planned tasks.\n   - Use the white buttons to minimize the planned tasks as much as possible.\n   - After processing all days, sum up the remaining uncompleted tasks to get the final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function min_uncompleted_tasks(T):\n       for each test case:\n           read N, K, M\n           read planned_tasks A\n           read completed_tasks B\n           read white_buttons C\n           read black_buttons D\n           \n           sort C in descending order\n           sort D in descending order\n           \n           total_uncompleted = 0\n           \n           for each day from 0 to N-1:\n               remaining_tasks = A[day] - B[day]\n               \n               if remaining_tasks > 0:\n                   use black buttons to increase completed tasks\n                   for each button in D:\n                       if button <= remaining_tasks:\n                           completed_tasks += button\n                           remaining_tasks -= button\n                           if remaining_tasks == 0:\n                               break\n                   \n                   use white buttons to reduce planned tasks\n                   for each button in C:\n                       if button <= A[day]:\n                           A[day] -= button\n                           break\n               \n               total_uncompleted += A[day] - B[day]\n           \n           print total_uncompleted\n\n   read T\n   min_uncompleted_tasks(T)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef min_uncompleted_tasks(T):\n    for _ in range(T):\n        # Read the number of days, white buttons, and black buttons\n        N, K, M = map(int, input().split())\n        # Read the planned tasks for each day\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        # Read the completed tasks for each day\n        B = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        # Read the values on the white buttons\n        C = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        # Read the values on the black buttons\n        D = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n        # Sort the white and black buttons in descending order\n        C.sort(reverse=True)\n        D.sort(reverse=True)\n        \n        total_uncompleted = 0\n        \n        for day in range(N):\n            # Calculate remaining tasks for the day\n            remaining_tasks = A[day] - B[day]\n            \n            # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks\n            if remaining_tasks > 0:\n                for button in D:\n                    if button <= remaining_tasks:\n                        B[day] += button\n                        remaining_tasks -= button\n                        if remaining_tasks == 0:\n                            break\n            \n            # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks\n            for button in C:\n                if button <= A[day]:\n                    A[day] -= button\n                    break\n            \n            # Calculate total uncompleted tasks\n            total_uncompleted += A[day] - B[day]\n        \n        # Output the total uncompleted tasks\n        print(total_uncompleted)\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nmin_uncompleted_tasks(T)\n```",
