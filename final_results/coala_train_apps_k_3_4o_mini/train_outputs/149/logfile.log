## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given a stringÂ s, a kÂ duplicate removalÂ consists of choosing kÂ adjacent and equal letters fromÂ s and removingÂ them causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.
We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.
Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
Example 2:
Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
Output: "aa"
Explanation: 
First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
Example 3:
Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
Output: "ps"

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 10^5
2 <= k <= 10^4
s only contains lower case English letters.

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to take a string `s` and repeatedly remove groups of `k` adjacent identical characters until no more such groups can be found. The goal is to return the final version of the string after all possible removals.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   We can use a stack to keep track of characters and their counts. As we iterate through the string, we will push characters onto the stack. If we encounter the same character again, we will increment its count. If the count reaches `k`, we will pop that character from the stack, effectively removing it from our result. At the end of the iteration, we will reconstruct the string from the stack.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize an empty stack
   For each character in the string:
       If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the same character:
           Increment the count of that character
           If the count reaches k:
               Remove the character from the stack
       Else:
           Push the character onto the stack with a count of 1
   Construct the final string from the stack
   Return the final string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and their counts
        stack = []
        
        # Iterate through each character in the string
        for char in s:
            # If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the same character
            if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:
                # Increment the count of that character
                stack[-1][1] += 1
                # If the count reaches k, remove the character from the stack
                if stack[-1][1] == k:
                    stack.pop()
            else:
                # Push the character onto the stack with a count of 1
                stack.append([char, 1])
        
        # Construct the final string from the stack
        result = ''.join(char * count for char, count in stack)
        return result

## Memories

[Summary]:
    The task involved decoding a string formatted as `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times the `encoded_string` should be repeated. The solution required iterating through the string, handling digits to form numbers, and using a stack to manage nested structures created by brackets.

    Key concepts included:
    - Building numbers from digits, which could be more than one digit long.
    - Using a stack to keep track of the current string and repeat counts when encountering opening brackets.
    - Repeating the current string and appending it to the last string when encountering closing brackets.

    The implemented solution effectively handled these requirements by maintaining a `current_string` and `current_num`, and using a stack to manage nested encodings. The final code successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was sound and efficient.

    The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
            stack = []
            current_num = 0
            current_string = ""

            for char in s:
                if char.isdigit():
                    current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)
                elif char == '[':
                    stack.append((current_string, current_num))
                    current_string = ""
                    current_num = 0
                elif char == ']':
                    last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()
                    current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count
                else:
                    current_string += char

            return current_string
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of using stacks for managing nested structures and highlighted the need to carefully handle string and number manipulations in such encoding problems.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such substring remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate strings and utilize loops for repeated operations. The solution successfully handled multiple test cases by reading input, processing each string, and outputting the final result after all removals.

    The implemented code used a while loop to check for "abc" and the `replace` method to remove it. This method was efficient for the problem's constraints, as it ensured that the string was modified in place until no "abc" substrings were left. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def remove_abc_pairs(test_cases):
        for s in test_cases:
            while "abc" in s:
                s = s.replace("abc", "", 1)
            print(s)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]
    remove_abc_pairs(test_cases)
    ```

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding string operations and iterative processes in programming.
[/Summary]


[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.


        The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.


        You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

        Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].


        Examples:

        s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
        s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
        s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
           The task is to decode a string that follows a specific encoding format. The format is `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer that indicates how many times the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets should be repeated. The goal is to return the fully decoded string.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           - We need to iterate through the input string character by character.
           - When we encounter a digit, we need to determine the full number (which could be more than one digit).
           - When we encounter an opening bracket `[`, we need to push the current number and the current decoded string onto a stack.
           - When we encounter a closing bracket `]`, we pop from the stack to get the last number and the last decoded string, then repeat the current decoded string that many times and append it to the last decoded string.
           - Finally, we return the fully decoded string.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function decodeString(s):

               current_num = 0  # To build the current number
               current_string = ""  # To build the current decoded string

               for char in s:
                   if char is a digit:
                       current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)  # Build the number
                   elif char is '[':

                       current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count  # Repeat the string
                   else:
                       current_string += char  # Append the character to the current string

   The task is to repeatedly remove groups of `k` adjacent and equal letters from a given string `s`. Whenever such a group is found, it should be removed, and the process should continue until no more such groups exist. The final result should be the modified string after all possible removals.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - We can use a stack to keep track of characters and their counts as we iterate through the string.
   - For each character, we check if it matches the top character of the stack. If it does, we increment the count of that character.
   - If the count reaches `k`, we pop that character from the stack (effectively removing it).
   - If it doesn't match, we push the character onto the stack with a count of 1.
   - At the end, we reconstruct the string from the stack.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to repeatedly remove groups of `k` adjacent and equal letters from a given string `s`. Whenever such a group is found, it should be removed, and the process should continue until no more such groups exist. The final result should be the modified string after all possible removals.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - We can use a stack to keep track of characters and their counts as we iterate through the string.
   - For each character, we check if it matches the top character of the stack. If it does, we increment the count of that character.
   - If the count reaches `k`, we pop that character from the stack (effectively removing it).
   - If it doesn't match, we push the character onto the stack with a count of 1.
   - At the end, we reconstruct the string from the stack.

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] The problem involved removing adjacent duplicate characters from a string based on a specified count `k`. The core concept was to utilize a stack to efficiently track characters and their counts as we processed the string. This approach allowed for easy removal of characters when their count reached `k`.

The solution involved iterating through the string and checking if the current character matched the top of the stack. If it did, we incremented the count; if the count reached `k`, we removed that character from the stack. If it didn't match, we pushed the character onto the stack with an initial count of 1. Finally, we reconstructed the string from the stack.

The implemented code was effective and passed the provided test cases without any issues. The use of a stack proved to be a suitable strategy for this problem, allowing for both efficient counting and removal of characters. 

Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        stack = []
        for char in s:
            if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:
                stack[-1][1] += 1
                if stack[-1][1] == k:
                    stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append([char, 1])
        final_string = ""
        for character, count in stack:
            final_string += character * count
        return final_string
``` 

This experience reinforced the effectiveness of stack-based solutions for problems involving consecutive elements and their counts.

        return res

INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] The official solution effectively utilizes a stack to manage character counts and efficiently remove duplicates. The key insights from the official solution include:

1. **Stack Initialization**: The stack is initialized with a placeholder character and a count of zero. This allows for a consistent comparison when processing the first character of the string.

2. **Character Processing**: As each character is processed:
   - If it differs from the top character of the stack, it is added to the stack with a count of 1.
   - If it matches, the count of the top character is incremented. If this count reaches `k`, the character is removed from the stack.

3. **Final String Construction**: After processing all characters, the final string is constructed by multiplying each character by its count stored in the stack.

The official solution is concise and avoids unnecessary checks by leveraging the stack's properties effectively. My approach was similar but could have been more streamlined by directly managing the stack without additional checks. The official solution's use of a placeholder character simplifies the logic for the first character and ensures that the stack is always in a valid state for comparison. 

Overall, the official solution is efficient and clear, demonstrating a solid understanding of stack operations in the context of this problem.

When a character matches the one at the top of the stack, its count is incremented, and if this count reaches k, the character is removed from the stack. If the character does not match, it is added to the stack with an initial count of 1. After processing all characters, the function reconstructs the final string by repeating each character according to its count in the stack. The modified string, with the specified duplicates removed, is then returned.

[Problem]
    Given a stringÂ s, a kÂ duplicate removalÂ consists of choosing kÂ adjacent and equal letters fromÂ s and removingÂ them causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.
    We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.
    Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.
    It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
Â 
    Example 1:
    Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
    Output: "abcd"
    Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
    Example 2:
    Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
    Output: "aa"
    Explanation: 
    First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
    Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
    Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
    Example 3:
    Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
    Output: "ps"

Â 
    Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 10^5
    2 <= k <= 10^4
    s only contains lower case English letters.

                    # Increment the count of the top character in the stack
                    stack[-1][1] += 1
                    # If the count reaches k, pop the character from the stack
                    if stack[-1][1] == k:
                        stack.pop()
                else:
                    # Push the character onto the stack with a count of 1
                    stack.append([char, 1])

            # Reconstruct the final string from the stack
            final_string = ""
            for character, count in stack:
                final_string += character * count  # Append character count times

            return final_string  # Return the final modified string
