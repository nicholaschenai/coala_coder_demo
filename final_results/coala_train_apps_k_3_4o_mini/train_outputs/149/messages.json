The solution required iterating through the string, handling digits to form numbers, and using a stack to manage nested structures created by brackets.\n\n    Key concepts included:\n    - Building numbers from digits, which could be more than one digit long.\n    - Using a stack to keep track of the current string and repeat counts when encountering opening brackets.\n    - Repeating the current string and appending it to the last string when encountering closing brackets.\n\n    The implemented solution effectively handled these requirements by maintaining a `current_string` and `current_num`, and using a stack to manage nested encodings. The final code successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was sound and efficient.\n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:\n            stack = []\n            current_num = 0\n            current_string = \"\"\n\n            for char in s:\n                if char.isdigit():\n                    current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)\n                elif char == '[':\n                    stack.append((current_string, current_num))\n                    current_string = \"\"\n                    current_num = 0\n                elif char == ']':\n                    last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()\n                    current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count\n                else:\n                    current_string += char\n\n            return current_string\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of using stacks for managing nested structures and highlighted the need to carefully handle string and number manipulations in such encoding problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring \"abc\" from given strings until no such substring remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of \"abc\" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate strings and utilize loops for repeated operations. The solution successfully handled multiple test cases by reading input, processing each string, and outputting the final result after all removals.\n\n    The implemented code used a while loop to check for \"abc\" and the `replace` method to remove it. This method was efficient for the problem's constraints, as it ensured that the string was modified in place until no \"abc\" substrings were left. The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def remove_abc_pairs(test_cases):\n        for s in test_cases:\n            while \"abc\" in s:\n                s = s.replace(\"abc\", \"\", 1)\n            print(s)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]\n    remove_abc_pairs(test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding string operations and iterative processes in programming.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.\n\n\n        The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.\n\n\n        You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.\n\n        Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].\n\n\n        Examples:\n\n        s = \"3[a]2[bc]\", return \"aaabcbc\".\n        s = \"3[a2[c]]\", return \"accaccacc\".\n        s = \"2[abc]3[cd]ef\", return \"abcabccdcdcdef\".\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        None\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n           The task is to decode a string that follows a specific encoding format. The format is `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer that indicates how many times the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets should be repeated. The goal is to return the fully decoded string.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n           - We need to iterate through the input string character by character.\n           - When we encounter a digit, we need to determine the full number (which could be more than one digit).\n           - When we encounter an opening bracket `[`, we need to push the current number and the current decoded string onto a stack.\n           - When we encounter a closing bracket `]`, we pop from the stack to get the last number and the last decoded string, then repeat the current decoded string that many times and append it to the last decoded string.\n           - Finally, we return the fully decoded string.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n           ```\n           function decodeString(s):\n               stack = []  # Initialize a stack to keep track of numbers and strings\n               current_num = 0  # To build the current number\n               current_string = \"\"  # To build the current decoded string\n\n               for char in s:\n                   if char is a digit:\n                       current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)  # Build the number\n                   elif char is '[':\n                       stack.append((current_string, current_num))  # Push current string and number onto stack\n                       current_string = \"\"  # Reset current string\n                       current_num = 0  # Reset current number\n                   elif char is ']':\n                       last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()  # Pop from stack\n                       current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count  # Repeat the string\n                   else:\n                       current_string += char  # Append the character to the current string\n\n               return current_string  # Return the fully decoded string\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n        ```python\n        class Solution:\n            def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:\n                # Initialize a stack to keep track of numbers and strings\n                stack = []\n                current_num = 0  # To build the current number\n                current_string = \"\"  # To build the current decoded string\n\n                # Iterate through each character in the input string\n                for char in s:\n                    if char.isdigit():  # Check if the character is a digit\n                        current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)  # Build the number\n                    elif char == '[':  # Check for opening bracket\n                        # Push the current string and number onto the stack\n                        stack.append((current_string, current_num))\n                        current_string = \"\"  # Reset current string\n                        current_num = 0  # Reset current number\n                    elif char == ']':  # Check for closing bracket\n                        # Pop from the stack to get the last string and repeat count\n                        last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()\n                        # Repeat the current string and append to the last string\n                        current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count\n                    else:  # If it's a regular character\n                        current_string += char  # Append the character to the current string\n\n                return current_string  # Return the fully decoded string\n        ```\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['\"3[a]2[bc]\"'] Output: \"aaabcbc\"\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
