    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The task is to repeatedly remove groups of `k` adjacent and equal letters from a given string `s`. Whenever such a group is found, it should be removed, and the process should continue until no more such groups exist. The final result should be the modified string after all possible removals.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   - We can use a stack to keep track of characters and their counts as we iterate through the string.\n   - For each character, we check if it matches the top character of the stack. If it does, we increment the count of that character.\n   - If the count reaches `k`, we pop that character from the stack (effectively removing it).\n   - If it doesn't match, we push the character onto the stack with a count of 1.\n   - At the end, we reconstruct the string from the stack.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function removeDuplicates(s, k):\n       stack = []  # Initialize a stack to keep track of characters and their counts\n\n       for char in s:\n           if stack is not empty and stack top character is equal to char:\n               increment the count of the top character in the stack\n               if count reaches k:\n                   pop the top character from the stack (remove it)\n           else:\n               push char onto the stack with a count of 1\n\n       # Reconstruct the final string from the stack\n       final_string = \"\"\n       for character, count in stack:\n           final_string += character * count  # Append character count times\n\n       return final_string  # Return the final modified string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n        # Initialize a stack to keep track of characters and their counts\n        stack = []\n\n        # Iterate through each character in the input string\n        for char in s:\n            if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:  # Check if the top character matches\n                # Increment the count of the top character in the stack\n                stack[-1][1] += 1\n                # If the count reaches k, pop the character from the stack\n                if stack[-1][1] == k:\n                    stack.pop()\n            else:\n                # Push the character onto the stack with a count of 1\n                stack.append([char, 1])\n\n        # Reconstruct the final string from the stack\n        final_string = \"\"\n        for character, count in stack:\n            final_string += character * count  # Append character count times\n\n        return final_string  # Return the final modified string\n```",
