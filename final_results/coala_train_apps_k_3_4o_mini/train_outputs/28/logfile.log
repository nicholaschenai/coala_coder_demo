## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----
Input
6
7
abacaba
7
???????
11
aba?abacaba
11
abacaba?aba
15
asdf???f???qwer
11
abacabacaba

Output
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abadabacaba
Yes
abacabadaba
No
No



-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to determine if we can replace the question marks in a given string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If it's possible, we should provide one valid string; if not, we should indicate that it's impossible.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each test case, we will check all possible positions in the string where "abacaba" could fit.
   - For each position, we will attempt to replace the question marks with the necessary characters to form "abacaba".
   - After placing "abacaba", we will replace any remaining question marks with 'z' (or any other letter) to ensure that we do not accidentally create another "abacaba".
   - Finally, we will check if "abacaba" appears exactly once in the modified string. If it does, we will return that string; otherwise, we will return "No".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such substring remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate strings and utilize loops for repeated operations. The solution successfully handled multiple test cases by reading input, processing each string, and outputting the final result after all removals.

    The implemented code used a while loop to check for "abc" and the `replace` method to remove it. This method was efficient for the problem's constraints, as it ensured that the string was modified in place until no "abc" substrings were left. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def remove_abc_pairs(test_cases):
        for s in test_cases:
            while "abc" in s:
                s = s.replace("abc", "", 1)
            print(s)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]
    remove_abc_pairs(test_cases)
    ```

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding string operations and iterative processes in programming.

        The chef is having one string of English lower case alphabets only. The chef wants to remove all "abc" special pairs where a,b,c are occurring consecutively. After removing the pair, create a new string and again remove "abc" special pair from a newly formed string. Repeate the process until no such pair remains in a string.

        -----Input:-----
        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
        - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, $String$. 

        -----Output:-----
        For each testcase, output in a single line answer, new String with no "abc" special pair.

        -----Constraints:-----
        $T \leq 2 $

    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
           The task is to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from a given string until no such substring remains. This needs to be done for multiple test cases.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
           We can approach this problem by using a loop that continuously checks for the presence of the substring "abc" in the string. If it is found, we remove it and check again. This process continues until the substring is no longer present in the string. We will apply this logic for each test case provided.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function remove_abc_pairs(test_cases):
               for each string in test_cases:
                   while "abc" is in string:
                       remove the first occurrence of "abc" from string
                   print the final string
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
        ```python
        def remove_abc_pairs(test_cases):
            # Iterate through each test case string
            for s in test_cases:
                # Continue removing "abc" until it no longer exists in the string
                while "abc" in s:
                    s = s.replace("abc", "", 1)  # Remove the first occurrence of "abc"
                print(s)  # Output the final string after all removals

        # Read number of test cases
        T = int(input())
        test_cases = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]  # Read each test case string
        remove_abc_pairs(test_cases)  # Call the function with the test cases
        ```

[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by using a while loop that checks for the presence of the substring "abc" in the string. It utilizes the `count` method to determine if "abc" exists and continues to replace all occurrences of "abc" until none remain. This approach is straightforward and ensures that all instances of the substring are removed in a single pass.

    One key insight from the official solution is the use of `s.replace("abc", "")` without specifying a count, which removes all occurrences of "abc" in one go. This is more efficient than my initial approach, which only removed the first occurrence each time. The official solution's method is simpler and potentially faster, especially for longer strings with multiple "abc" substrings.

    In terms of performance, the official solution may have a better time complexity since it avoids the overhead of repeatedly checking for the substring's presence after each removal. Instead, it directly counts and removes all instances in one operation, which can lead to fewer iterations overall.

    Overall, the official solution is more efficient and concise, highlighting the importance of considering built-in string methods that can simplify the implementation while improving performance.

For each position, we will check if the substring can be formed by replacing question marks and ensuring that no other "abacaba" can be formed elsewhere in the string. If we find a valid configuration, we will replace the remaining question marks with any letter (e.g., 'z') to complete the string. If we cannot find a valid configuration, we will return "No".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_form_abacaba(s):
       count = 0
       for i from 0 to len(s) - 7:
           if s[i:i+7] can form "abacaba":
               count += 1
               if count > 1:
                   return "No"
       if count == 1:
           replace remaining '?' with 'z'
           return "Yes" and the modified string
       else:

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----

abacaba

abacabacaba

Output
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abadabacaba
Yes
abacabadaba
No
No



-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to replace question marks in the string such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If "abacaba" can be formed in multiple ways or if it appears more than once after replacements, we should return "No".

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the case where "abacaba" can be formed in multiple positions. It only checks for one occurrence and does not account for the possibility of overlapping occurrences.
   - The replacement of remaining question marks with 'z' is not handled correctly. If "abacaba" is placed in the string, we should ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed by the remaining characters.
   - The logic for checking if "abacaba" can be formed does not account for the fact that if we place "abacaba" in one position, we need to ensure that no other part of the string can also form "abacaba".

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - I did not properly check for overlapping occurrences of "abacaba". The code should ensure that after placing "abacaba", no other substring can match it.
   - The logic for replacing question marks was too simplistic and did not consider the context of the string after placing "abacaba".

### Revised Approach:
1. **Count Occurrences**: First, we will count how many times "abacaba" can be formed in the string.
2. **Place "abacaba"**: If we find exactly one valid position, we will place "abacaba" there and replace all remaining question marks with 'z'.
3. **Final Check**: After placing "abacaba", we will check the entire string to ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed.

### Revised Code:
```python
def can_form_abacaba(s):
    target = "abacaba"
    count = 0
    n = len(s)

                if new_s.count(target) == 1:
                    return "Yes\n" + new_s
                else:
                    return "No"
    
    return "No"

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    print(can_form_abacaba(s))  # Call the function for each test case
``` 

This revised code should correctly handle the requirements of the problem by ensuring that "abacaba" appears exactly once and that all question marks are replaced appropriately.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----
Input
6
7
abacaba
7
???????
11
aba?abacaba
11
abacaba?aba
15
asdf???f???qwer
11
abacabacaba

Output
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abadabacaba
Yes
abacabadaba
No
No



-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to determine if we can replace question marks in a given string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If possible, we should provide the modified string; otherwise, we should indicate that it's not possible.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   We will iterate through the string to find potential positions where "abacaba" can fit. For each position, we will check if the substring can be formed by replacing question marks and ensuring that no other "abacaba" can be formed elsewhere in the string. If we find a valid configuration, we will replace the remaining question marks with any letter (e.g., 'z') to complete the string. If we cannot find a valid configuration, we will return "No".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_form_abacaba(s):
       count = 0
       for i from 0 to len(s) - 7:
           if s[i:i+7] can form "abacaba":
               count += 1
               if count > 1:
                   return "No"
       if count == 1:
           replace remaining '?' with 'z'
           return "Yes" and the modified string

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to replace question marks in the string such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If "abacaba" can be formed in multiple ways or if it appears more than once after replacements, we should return "No".

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the case where "abacaba" can be formed in multiple positions. It only checks for one occurrence and does not account for the possibility of overlapping occurrences.
   - The replacement of remaining question marks with 'z' is not handled correctly. If "abacaba" is placed in the string, we should ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed by the remaining characters.
   - The logic for checking if "abacaba" can be formed does not account for the fact that if we place "abacaba" in one position, we need to ensure that no other part of the string can also form "abacaba".

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - I did not properly check for overlapping occurrences of "abacaba". The code should ensure that after placing "abacaba", no other substring can match it.
   - The logic for replacing question marks was too simplistic and did not consider the context of the string after placing "abacaba".

### Revised Approach:
1. **Count Occurrences**: First, we will count how many times "abacaba" can be formed in the string.
2. **Place "abacaba"**: If we find exactly one valid position, we will place "abacaba" there and replace all remaining question marks with 'z'.
3. **Final Check**: After placing "abacaba", we will check the entire string to ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed.

### Revised Code:
```python
def can_form_abacaba(s):
    target = "abacaba"
    count = 0
    n = len(s)
    
    # Check for all possible positions to place "abacaba"

        can_form = True
        for j in range(7):

                break
        if can_form:
            count += 1
            if count > 1:  # More than one occurrence found
                return "No"
            position = i  # Store the position where we can place "abacaba"
    
    if count == 1:  # Exactly one occurrence found
        # Create a new string with "abacaba" placed
        new_s = list(s)
        for j in range(7):

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such substring remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate strings and utilize loops for repeated operations. The solution successfully handled multiple test cases by reading input, processing each string, and outputting the final result after all removals.

    The implemented code used a while loop to check for "abc" and the `replace` method to remove it. This method was efficient for the problem's constraints, as it ensured that the string was modified in place until no "abc" substrings were left. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def remove_abc_pairs(test_cases):
        for s in test_cases:
            while "abc" in s:
                s = s.replace("abc", "", 1)
            print(s)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]
    remove_abc_pairs(test_cases)
    ```

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding string operations and iterative processes in programming.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by using a while loop that checks for the presence of the substring "abc" in the string. It utilizes the `count` method to determine if "abc" exists and continues to replace all occurrences of "abc" until none remain. This approach is straightforward and ensures that all instances of the substring are removed in a single pass.

    One key insight from the official solution is the use of `s.replace("abc", "")` without specifying a count, which removes all occurrences of "abc" in one go. This is more efficient than my initial approach, which only removed the first occurrence each time. The official solution's method is simpler and potentially faster, especially for longer strings with multiple "abc" substrings.

    In terms of performance, the official solution may have a better time complexity since it avoids the overhead of repeatedly checking for the substring's presence after each removal. Instead, it directly counts and removes all instances in one operation, which can lead to fewer iterations overall.

    Overall, the official solution is more efficient and concise, highlighting the importance of considering built-in string methods that can simplify the implementation while improving performance.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        The chef is having one string of English lower case alphabets only. The chef wants to remove all "abc" special pairs where a,b,c are occurring consecutively. After removing the pair, create a new string and again remove "abc" special pair from a newly formed string. Repeate the process until no such pair remains in a string.

        -----Input:-----
        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
        - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, $String$. 

        -----Output:-----
        For each testcase, output in a single line answer, new String with no "abc" special pair.

        -----Constraints:-----
        $T \leq 2 $
        $1 \leq String length \leq 1000 $

        -----Sample Input:-----
        2
        aabcc
        bababccc

        -----Sample Output:-----
        ac
        bc

        -----EXPLANATION:-----
        For 1) after removing "abc" at middle we get a new string as ac.
        For 2) string = bababccc
        newString1 = babcc  // After removing middle "abc"
        newString2 = bc   //After removing "abc"

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
           The task is to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from a given string until no such substring remains. This needs to be done for multiple test cases.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
           We can approach this problem by using a loop that continuously checks for the presence of the substring "abc" in the string. If it is found, we remove it and check again. This process continues until the substring is no longer present in the string. We will apply this logic for each test case provided.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function remove_abc_pairs(test_cases):
               for each string in test_cases:
                   while "abc" is in string:
                       remove the first occurrence of "abc" from string
                   print the final string
           ```

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] Based on the insights and reflections from the previous attempts, I will now provide a corrected solution to the original problem of replacing question marks in a string to ensure that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once.

### Key Steps in the Revised Solution:
1. **Count Occurrences**: We will check how many times "abacaba" can be formed in the string.
2. **Place "abacaba"**: If we find exactly one valid position, we will place "abacaba" there and replace all remaining question marks with 'z'.
3. **Final Check**: After placing "abacaba", we will check the entire string to ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def can_form_abacaba(s):
    target = "abacaba"
    n = len(s)
    count = 0
    position = -1
    
    # Check for all possible positions to place "abacaba"
    for i in range(n - 6):
        can_form = True
        for j in range(7):
            if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                can_form = False
                break
        if can_form:
            count += 1
            position = i  # Store the position where we can place "abacaba"
    
    if count == 1:  # Exactly one occurrence found
        # Create a new string with "abacaba" placed
        new_s = list(s)
        for j in range(7):
            new_s[position + j] = target[j]
        # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
        new_s = ''.join(new_s).replace('?', 'z')
        return "Yes\n" + new_s
    
    # If no occurrence found, try to place "abacaba" in the first valid position
    if count == 0:
        for i in range(n - 6):
            can_form = True
            for j in range(7):
                if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                    can_form = False
                    break
            if can_form:
                # Create a new string with "abacaba" placed
                new_s = list(s)
                for j in range(7):
                    new_s[i + j] = target[j]
                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                new_s = ''.join(new_s).replace('?', 'z')
                # Check if "abacaba" appears more than once
                if new_s.count(target) == 1:
                    return "Yes\n" + new_s
                else:
                    return "No"
    
    return "No"

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    print(can_form_abacaba(s))  # Call the function for each test case
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function `can_form_abacaba` checks for valid placements of "abacaba" in the string.
- It counts how many valid placements exist and records the position of the first valid placement.
- If exactly one valid placement is found, it constructs the new string by placing "abacaba" and replacing remaining question marks with 'z'.
- If no valid placements are found, it checks if placing "abacaba" in any position results in exactly one occurrence.
- Finally, it returns "Yes" with the modified string or "No" if it's not possible to achieve the desired condition.

This code should now correctly handle all test cases as specified in the problem statement.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----

Output

Yes
abadabacaba
Yes
abacabadaba
No

-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to determine if we can replace question marks in a given string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If possible, we should provide the modified string; otherwise, we should indicate that it's not possible.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   We will iterate through the string to find potential positions where "abacaba" can fit. For each position, we will check if the substring can be formed by replacing question marks and ensuring that no other "abacaba" can be formed elsewhere in the string. If we find a valid configuration, we will replace the remaining question marks with any letter (e.g., 'z') to complete the string. If we cannot find a valid configuration, we will return "No".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_form_abacaba(s):
       count = 0
       for i from 0 to len(s) - 7:
           if s[i:i+7] can form "abacaba":
               count += 1
               if count > 1:
                   return "No"
       if count == 1:
           replace remaining '?' with 'z'
           return "Yes" and the modified string
       else:
           return "No"

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to replace question marks in the string such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If "abacaba" can be formed in multiple ways or if it appears more than once after replacements, we should return "No".

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the case where "abacaba" can be formed in multiple positions. It only checks for one occurrence and does not account for the possibility of overlapping occurrences.
   - The replacement of remaining question marks with 'z' is not handled correctly. If "abacaba" is placed in the string, we should ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed by the remaining characters.
   - The logic for checking if "abacaba" can be formed does not account for the fact that if we place "abacaba" in one position, we need to ensure that no other part of the string can also form "abacaba".

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - I did not properly check for overlapping occurrences of "abacaba". The code should ensure that after placing "abacaba", no other substring can match it.
   - The logic for replacing question marks was too simplistic and did not consider the context of the string after placing "abacaba".

### Revised Approach:
1. **Count Occurrences**: First, we will count how many times "abacaba" can be formed in the string.
2. **Place "abacaba"**: If we find exactly one valid position, we will place "abacaba" there and replace all remaining question marks with 'z'.
3. **Final Check**: After placing "abacaba", we will check the entire string to ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed.

### Revised Code:
```python
def can_form_abacaba(s):
    target = "abacaba"
    count = 0
    n = len(s)
    
    # Check for all possible positions to place "abacaba"
    for i in range(n - 6):
        can_form = True
        for j in range(7):
            if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                can_form = False
                break
        if can_form:
            count += 1
            if count > 1:  # More than one occurrence found
                return "No"
            position = i  # Store the position where we can place "abacaba"
    
    if count == 1:  # Exactly one occurrence found
        # Create a new string with "abacaba" placed
        new_s = list(s)
        for j in range(7):
            new_s[position + j] = target[j]
        # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
        new_s = ''.join(new_s).replace('?', 'z')
        return "Yes\n" + new_s
    
    # If no occurrence found, try to place "abacaba" in the first valid position
    if count == 0:
        for i in range(n - 6):
            can_form = True
            for j in range(7):
                if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                    can_form = False
                    break
            if can_form:
                # Create a new string with "abacaba" placed
                new_s = list(s)
                for j in range(7):
                    new_s[i + j] = target[j]
                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                new_s = ''.join(new_s).replace('?', 'z')
                # Check if "abacaba" appears more than once
                if new_s.count(target) == 1:
                    return "Yes\n" + new_s
                else:
                    return "No"
    
    return "No"

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    print(can_form_abacaba(s))  # Call the function for each test case
``` 

This revised code should correctly handle the requirements of the problem by ensuring that "abacaba" appears exactly once and that all question marks are replaced appropriately.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Based on the insights and reflections from the previous attempts, I will now provide a corrected solution to the original problem of replacing question marks in a string to ensure that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once.

### Key Steps in the Revised Solution:

for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    print(can_form_abacaba(s))  # Call the function for each test case
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function `can_form_abacaba` checks for valid placements of "abacaba" in the string.
- It counts how many valid placements exist and records the position of the first valid placement.
- If exactly one valid placement is found, it constructs the new string by placing "abacaba" and replacing remaining question marks with 'z'.
- If no valid placements are found, it checks if placing "abacaba" in any position results in exactly one occurrence.
- Finally, it returns "Yes" with the modified string or "No" if it's not possible to achieve the desired condition.

This code should now correctly handle all test cases as specified in the problem statement.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----

abacaba

Output

-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to determine if we can replace question marks in a given string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If possible, we should provide the modified string; otherwise, we should indicate that it's not possible.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   We will iterate through the string to find potential positions where "abacaba" can fit. For each position, we will check if the substring can be formed by replacing question marks and ensuring that no other "abacaba" can be formed elsewhere in the string. If we find a valid configuration, we will replace the remaining question marks with any letter (e.g., 'z') to complete the string. If we cannot find a valid configuration, we will return "No".

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to replace question marks in the string such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If "abacaba" can be formed in multiple ways or if it appears more than once after replacements, we should return "No".

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the case where "abacaba" can be formed in multiple positions. It only checks for one occurrence and does not account for the possibility of overlapping occurrences.
   - The replacement of remaining question marks with 'z' is not handled correctly. If "abacaba" is placed in the string, we should ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed by the remaining characters.
   - The logic for checking if "abacaba" can be formed does not account for the fact that if we place "abacaba" in one position, we need to ensure that no other part of the string can also form "abacaba".

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - I did not properly check for overlapping occurrences of "abacaba". The code should ensure that after placing "abacaba", no other substring can match it.
   - The logic for replacing question marks was too simplistic and did not consider the context of the string after placing "abacaba".

### Revised Approach:
1. **Count Occurrences**: First, we will count how many times "abacaba" can be formed in the string.
2. **Place "abacaba"**: If we find exactly one valid position, we will place "abacaba" there and replace all remaining question marks with 'z'.
3. **Final Check**: After placing "abacaba", we will check the entire string to ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed.

### Revised Code:
```python
def can_form_abacaba(s):
    target = "abacaba"
    count = 0
    n = len(s)
    
    # Check for all possible positions to place "abacaba"

                break
        if can_form:
            count += 1
            if count > 1:  # More than one occurrence found
                return "No"
            position = i  # Store the position where we can place "abacaba"
    
    if count == 1:  # Exactly one occurrence found
        # Create a new string with "abacaba" placed
        new_s = list(s)
        for j in range(7):
            new_s[position + j] = target[j]
        # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
        new_s = ''.join(new_s).replace('?', 'z')
        return "Yes\n" + new_s

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Based on the insights and reflections from the previous attempts, I will now provide a corrected solution to the original problem of replacing question marks in a string to ensure that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once.

### Key Steps in the Revised Solution:
1. **Count Occurrences**: We will check how many times "abacaba" can be formed in the string.
2. **Place "abacaba"**: If we find exactly one valid position, we will place "abacaba" there and replace all remaining question marks with 'z'.

for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    print(can_form_abacaba(s))  # Call the function for each test case
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function `can_form_abacaba` checks for valid placements of "abacaba" in the string.
- It counts how many valid placements exist and records the position of the first valid placement.
- If exactly one valid placement is found, it constructs the new string by placing "abacaba" and replacing remaining question marks with 'z'.
- If no valid placements are found, it checks if placing "abacaba" in any position results in exactly one occurrence.
- Finally, it returns "Yes" with the modified string or "No" if it's not possible to achieve the desired condition.

This code should now correctly handle all test cases as specified in the problem statement.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such substring remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate strings and utilize loops for repeated operations. The solution successfully handled multiple test cases by reading input, processing each string, and outputting the final result after all removals.

    The implemented code used a while loop to check for "abc" and the `replace` method to remove it. This method was efficient for the problem's constraints, as it ensured that the string was modified in place until no "abc" substrings were left. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def remove_abc_pairs(test_cases):
        for s in test_cases:
            while "abc" in s:
                s = s.replace("abc", "", 1)
            print(s)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]
    remove_abc_pairs(test_cases)
    ```

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding string operations and iterative processes in programming.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by using a while loop that checks for the presence of the substring "abc" in the string. It utilizes the `count` method to determine if "abc" exists and continues to replace all occurrences of "abc" until none remain. This approach is straightforward and ensures that all instances of the substring are removed in a single pass.

    One key insight from the official solution is the use of `s.replace("abc", "")` without specifying a count, which removes all occurrences of "abc" in one go. This is more efficient than my initial approach, which only removed the first occurrence each time. The official solution's method is simpler and potentially faster, especially for longer strings with multiple "abc" substrings.

    In terms of performance, the official solution may have a better time complexity since it avoids the overhead of repeatedly checking for the substring's presence after each removal. Instead, it directly counts and removes all instances in one operation, which can lead to fewer iterations overall.

    Overall, the official solution is more efficient and concise, highlighting the importance of considering built-in string methods that can simplify the implementation while improving performance.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        The chef is having one string of English lower case alphabets only. The chef wants to remove all "abc" special pairs where a,b,c are occurring consecutively. After removing the pair, create a new string and again remove "abc" special pair from a newly formed string. Repeate the process until no such pair remains in a string.

        -----Input:-----
        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
        - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, $String$. 

        -----Output:-----
        For each testcase, output in a single line answer, new String with no "abc" special pair.

        -----Constraints:-----
        $T \leq 2 $
        $1 \leq String length \leq 1000 $

        -----Sample Input:-----
        2
        aabcc
        bababccc

        -----Sample Output:-----
        ac
        bc

        -----EXPLANATION:-----
        For 1) after removing "abc" at middle we get a new string as ac.
        For 2) string = bababccc
        newString1 = babcc  // After removing middle "abc"
        newString2 = bc   //After removing "abc"

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
           The task is to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from a given string until no such substring remains. This needs to be done for multiple test cases.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
           We can approach this problem by using a loop that continuously checks for the presence of the substring "abc" in the string. If it is found, we remove it and check again. This process continues until the substring is no longer present in the string. We will apply this logic for each test case provided.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function remove_abc_pairs(test_cases):
               for each string in test_cases:
                   while "abc" is in string:
                       remove the first occurrence of "abc" from string
                   print the final string
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
        ```python
        def remove_abc_pairs(test_cases):
            # Iterate through each test case string

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] Given the previous insights and the need to ensure that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once in the modified string, I will revise the solution accordingly. The key steps will involve checking for valid placements of "abacaba", ensuring that it can be placed without creating additional occurrences, and replacing remaining question marks appropriately.

Hereâ€™s the corrected Python code:

```python
def can_form_abacaba(s):
    target = "abacaba"
    n = len(s)
    count = 0
    position = -1
    
    # Check for all possible positions to place "abacaba"
    for i in range(n - 6):
        can_form = True
        for j in range(7):
            if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                can_form = False
                break
        if can_form:
            count += 1
            position = i  # Store the position where we can place "abacaba"
    
    if count > 1:  # More than one occurrence found
        return "No"
    
    if count == 1:  # Exactly one occurrence found
        # Create a new string with "abacaba" placed
        new_s = list(s)
        for j in range(7):
            new_s[position + j] = target[j]
        # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
        new_s = ''.join(new_s).replace('?', 'z')
        # Check if "abacaba" appears more than once
        if new_s.count(target) == 1:
            return "Yes\n" + new_s
        else:
            return "No"
    
    # If no occurrence found, try to place "abacaba" in the first valid position
    for i in range(n - 6):
        can_form = True
        for j in range(7):
            if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                can_form = False
                break
        if can_form:
            # Create a new string with "abacaba" placed
            new_s = list(s)
            for j in range(7):
                new_s[i + j] = target[j]
            # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
            new_s = ''.join(new_s).replace('?', 'z')
            # Check if "abacaba" appears more than once
            if new_s.count(target) == 1:
                return "Yes\n" + new_s
            else:
                return "No"
    
    return "No"

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    print(can_form_abacaba(s))  # Call the function for each test case
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function `can_form_abacaba` checks for valid placements of "abacaba" in the string.
- It counts how many valid placements exist and records the position of the first valid placement.
- If exactly one valid placement is found, it constructs the new string by placing "abacaba" and replacing remaining question marks with 'z'.
- If no valid placements are found, it checks if placing "abacaba" in any position results in exactly one occurrence.
- Finally, it returns "Yes" with the modified string or "No" if it's not possible to achieve the desired condition.

This code should now correctly handle all test cases as specified in the problem statement.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----

abacaba

Output

Yes
abadabacaba
Yes
abacabadaba
No
No



-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to determine if we can replace question marks in a given string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If possible, we should provide the modified string; otherwise, we should indicate that it's not possible.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   We will iterate through the string to find potential positions where "abacaba" can fit. For each position, we will check if the substring can be formed by replacing question marks and ensuring that no other "abacaba" can be formed elsewhere in the string. If we find a valid configuration, we will replace the remaining question marks with any letter (e.g., 'z') to complete the string. If we cannot find a valid configuration, we will return "No".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_form_abacaba(s):
       count = 0
       for i from 0 to len(s) - 7:
           if s[i:i+7] can form "abacaba":
               count += 1
               if count > 1:
                   return "No"
       if count == 1:
           replace remaining '?' with 'z'
           return "Yes" and the modified string
       else:
           return "No"

   read T
   for each test case:
       read n and s

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to replace question marks in the string such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If "abacaba" can be formed in multiple ways or if it appears more than once after replacements, we should return "No".

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the case where "abacaba" can be formed in multiple positions. It only checks for one occurrence and does not account for the possibility of overlapping occurrences.
   - The replacement of remaining question marks with 'z' is not handled correctly. If "abacaba" is placed in the string, we should ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed by the remaining characters.
   - The logic for checking if "abacaba" can be formed does not account for the fact that if we place "abacaba" in one position, we need to ensure that no other part of the string can also form "abacaba".

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - I did not properly check for overlapping occurrences of "abacaba". The code should ensure that after placing "abacaba", no other substring can match it.
   - The logic for replacing question marks was too simplistic and did not consider the context of the string after placing "abacaba".

### Revised Approach:
1. **Count Occurrences**: First, we will count how many times "abacaba" can be formed in the string.
2. **Place "abacaba"**: If we find exactly one valid position, we will place "abacaba" there and replace all remaining question marks with 'z'.
3. **Final Check**: After placing "abacaba", we will check the entire string to ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed.

### Revised Code:
```python
def can_form_abacaba(s):
    target = "abacaba"
    count = 0
    n = len(s)
    
    # Check for all possible positions to place "abacaba"
    for i in range(n - 6):
        can_form = True
        for j in range(7):
            if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                can_form = False
                break
        if can_form:
            count += 1
            if count > 1:  # More than one occurrence found
                return "No"
            position = i  # Store the position where we can place "abacaba"
    
    if count == 1:  # Exactly one occurrence found
        # Create a new string with "abacaba" placed
        new_s = list(s)
        for j in range(7):
            new_s[position + j] = target[j]
        # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
        new_s = ''.join(new_s).replace('?', 'z')
        return "Yes\n" + new_s
    
    # If no occurrence found, try to place "abacaba" in the first valid position
    if count == 0:
        for i in range(n - 6):
            can_form = True
            for j in range(7):
                if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                    can_form = False
                    break
            if can_form:

                new_s = list(s)
                for j in range(7):
                    new_s[i + j] = target[j]
                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                new_s = ''.join(new_s).replace('?', 'z')
                # Check if "abacaba" appears more than once
                if new_s.count(target) == 1:
                    return "Yes\n" + new_s
                else:
                    return "No"
    
    return "No"

for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())

``` 

This revised code should correctly handle the requirements of the problem by ensuring that "abacaba" appears exactly once and that all question marks are replaced appropriately.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Based on the insights and reflections from the previous attempts, I will now provide a corrected solution to the original problem of replacing question marks in a string to ensure that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once.

for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    print(can_form_abacaba(s))  # Call the function for each test case
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function `can_form_abacaba` checks for valid placements of "abacaba" in the string.
- It counts how many valid placements exist and records the position of the first valid placement.
- If exactly one valid placement is found, it constructs the new string by placing "abacaba" and replacing remaining question marks with 'z'.
- If no valid placements are found, it checks if placing "abacaba" in any position results in exactly one occurrence.
- Finally, it returns "Yes" with the modified string or "No" if it's not possible to achieve the desired condition.

This code should now correctly handle all test cases as specified in the problem statement.

    print(can_form_abacaba(s))  # Call the function for each test case
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function `can_form_abacaba` checks for valid placements of "abacaba" in the string.
- It counts how many valid placements exist and records the position of the first valid placement.
- If exactly one valid placement is found, it constructs the new string by placing "abacaba" and replacing remaining question marks with 'z'.
- If no valid placements are found, it checks if placing "abacaba" in any position results in exactly one occurrence.
- Finally, it returns "Yes" with the modified string or "No" if it's not possible to achieve the desired condition.

This code should now correctly handle all test cases as specified in the problem statement.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----
Input
6
7
abacaba
7
???????
11
aba?abacaba
11
abacaba?aba
15
asdf???f???qwer
11
abacabacaba

Output
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abadabacaba
Yes
abacabadaba
No
No



-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to determine if we can replace question marks in a given string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If possible, we should provide the modified string; otherwise, we should indicate that it's not possible.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   We will iterate through the string to find potential positions where "abacaba" can fit. For each position, we will check if the substring can be formed by replacing question marks and ensuring that no other "abacaba" can be formed elsewhere in the string. If we find a valid configuration, we will replace the remaining question marks with any letter (e.g., 'z') to complete the string. If we cannot find a valid configuration, we will return "No".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_form_abacaba(s):
       count = 0
       for i from 0 to len(s) - 7:
           if s[i:i+7] can form "abacaba":
               count += 1
               if count > 1:
                   return "No"
       if count == 1:
           replace remaining '?' with 'z'
           return "Yes" and the modified string
       else:
           return "No"

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to replace question marks in the string such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If "abacaba" can be formed in multiple ways or if it appears more than once after replacements, we should return "No".

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the case where "abacaba" can be formed in multiple positions. It only checks for one occurrence and does not account for the possibility of overlapping occurrences.
   - The replacement of remaining question marks with 'z' is not handled correctly. If "abacaba" is placed in the string, we should ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed by the remaining characters.
   - The logic for checking if "abacaba" can be formed does not account for the fact that if we place "abacaba" in one position, we need to ensure that no other part of the string can also form "abacaba".

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - I did not properly check for overlapping occurrences of "abacaba". The code should ensure that after placing "abacaba", no other substring can match it.
   - The logic for replacing question marks was too simplistic and did not consider the context of the string after placing "abacaba".

### Revised Approach:
1. **Count Occurrences**: First, we will count how many times "abacaba" can be formed in the string.
2. **Place "abacaba"**: If we find exactly one valid position, we will place "abacaba" there and replace all remaining question marks with 'z'.
3. **Final Check**: After placing "abacaba", we will check the entire string to ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed.

### Revised Code:
```python
def can_form_abacaba(s):
    target = "abacaba"
    count = 0
    n = len(s)

        can_form = True

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Based on the insights and reflections from the previous attempts, I will now provide a corrected solution to the original problem of replacing question marks in a string to ensure that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once.

### Key Steps in the Revised Solution:
1. **Count Occurrences**: We will check how many times "abacaba" can be formed in the string.
2. **Place "abacaba"**: If we find exactly one valid position, we will place "abacaba" there and replace all remaining question marks with 'z'.
3. **Final Check**: After placing "abacaba", we will check the entire string to ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed.

                if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                    can_form = False
                    break
            if can_form:

                new_s = list(s)
                for j in range(7):
                    new_s[i + j] = target[j]
                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                new_s = ''.join(new_s).replace('?', 'z')
                # Check if "abacaba" appears more than once
                if new_s.count(target) == 1:
                    return "Yes\n" + new_s
                else:
                    return "No"
    
    return "No"

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    print(can_form_abacaba(s))  # Call the function for each test case
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function `can_form_abacaba` checks for valid placements of "abacaba" in the string.
- It counts how many valid placements exist and records the position of the first valid placement.
- If exactly one valid placement is found, it constructs the new string by placing "abacaba" and replacing remaining question marks with 'z'.
- If no valid placements are found, it checks if placing "abacaba" in any position results in exactly one occurrence.
- Finally, it returns "Yes" with the modified string or "No" if it's not possible to achieve the desired condition.

This code should now correctly handle all test cases as specified in the problem statement.

   - The code does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple question marks and how they can be replaced to ensure that "abacaba" appears exactly once.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - I did not properly check for overlapping occurrences of "abacaba". The code should ensure that after placing "abacaba", no other substring can match it.
   - The logic for replacing question marks was too simplistic and did not consider the context of the string after placing "abacaba".

### Revised Approach:
1. **Count Occurrences**: First, we will check how many times "abacaba" can be formed in the string.
2. **Place "abacaba"**: If we find exactly one valid position, we will place "abacaba" there and replace all remaining question marks with 'z'.
3. **Final Check**: After placing "abacaba", we will check the entire string to ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed.

### Revised Code:
```python
def can_form_abacaba(s):
    target = "abacaba"
    n = len(s)
    count = 0
    position = -1

    for i in range(n - 6):
        can_form = True
        for j in range(7):
            if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                can_form = False
                break
        if can_form:
            count += 1
            position = i  # Store the position where we can place "abacaba"
    
    if count > 1:  # More than one occurrence found
        return "No"
    
    if count == 1:  # Exactly one occurrence found
        # Create a new string with "abacaba" placed
        new_s = list(s)
        for j in range(7):
            new_s[position + j] = target[j]
        # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
        new_s = ''.join(new_s).replace('?', 'z')
        # Check if "abacaba" appears more than once
        if new_s.count(target) == 1:
            return "Yes\n" + new_s
        else:
            return "No"

for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    print(can_form_abacaba(s))  # Call the function for each test case
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function `can_form_abacaba` checks for valid placements of "abacaba" in the string.
- It counts how many valid placements exist and records the position of the first valid placement.
- If exactly one valid placement is found, it constructs the new string by placing "abacaba" and replacing remaining question marks with 'z'.
- If no valid placements are found, it checks if placing "abacaba" in any position results in exactly one occurrence.
- Finally, it returns "Yes" with the modified string or "No" if it's not possible to achieve the desired condition.

This code should now correctly handle all test cases as specified in the problem statement.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such substring remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate strings and utilize loops for repeated operations. The solution successfully handled multiple test cases by reading input, processing each string, and outputting the final result after all removals.

    The implemented code used a while loop to check for "abc" and the `replace` method to remove it. This method was efficient for the problem's constraints, as it ensured that the string was modified in place until no "abc" substrings were left. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def remove_abc_pairs(test_cases):
        for s in test_cases:
            while "abc" in s:
                s = s.replace("abc", "", 1)
            print(s)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]
    remove_abc_pairs(test_cases)
    ```

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding string operations and iterative processes in programming.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by using a while loop that checks for the presence of the substring "abc" in the string. It utilizes the `count` method to determine if "abc" exists and continues to replace all occurrences of "abc" until none remain. This approach is straightforward and ensures that all instances of the substring are removed in a single pass.

    One key insight from the official solution is the use of `s.replace("abc", "")` without specifying a count, which removes all occurrences of "abc" in one go. This is more efficient than my initial approach, which only removed the first occurrence each time. The official solution's method is simpler and potentially faster, especially for longer strings with multiple "abc" substrings.

    In terms of performance, the official solution may have a better time complexity since it avoids the overhead of repeatedly checking for the substring's presence after each removal. Instead, it directly counts and removes all instances in one operation, which can lead to fewer iterations overall.

    Overall, the official solution is more efficient and concise, highlighting the importance of considering built-in string methods that can simplify the implementation while improving performance.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        The chef is having one string of English lower case alphabets only. The chef wants to remove all "abc" special pairs where a,b,c are occurring consecutively. After removing the pair, create a new string and again remove "abc" special pair from a newly formed string. Repeate the process until no such pair remains in a string.

        -----Input:-----
        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
        - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, $String$. 

        -----Output:-----
        For each testcase, output in a single line answer, new String with no "abc" special pair.

        -----Constraints:-----
        $T \leq 2 $
        $1 \leq String length \leq 1000 $

        -----Sample Input:-----
        2
        aabcc
        bababccc

        -----Sample Output:-----
        ac
        bc

        -----EXPLANATION:-----
        For 1) after removing "abc" at middle we get a new string as ac.
        For 2) string = bababccc
        newString1 = babcc  // After removing middle "abc"
        newString2 = bc   //After removing "abc"

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
           The task is to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from a given string until no such substring remains. This needs to be done for multiple test cases.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
           We can approach this problem by using a loop that continuously checks for the presence of the substring "abc" in the string. If it is found, we remove it and check again. This process continues until the substring is no longer present in the string. We will apply this logic for each test case provided.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function remove_abc_pairs(test_cases):
               for each string in test_cases:
                   while "abc" is in string:
                       remove the first occurrence of "abc" from string
                   print the final string
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
        ```python
        def remove_abc_pairs(test_cases):
            # Iterate through each test case string
            for s in test_cases:
                # Continue removing "abc" until it no longer exists in the string
                while "abc" in s:
                    s = s.replace("abc", "", 1)  # Remove the first occurrence of "abc"
                print(s)  # Output the final string after all removals

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] Based on the previous analysis and the insights gained, I will now provide a corrected solution to the original problem of replacing question marks in a string to ensure that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once.

### Key Steps in the Revised Solution:
1. **Count Occurrences**: We will check how many times "abacaba" can be formed in the string.
2. **Place "abacaba"**: If we find exactly one valid position, we will place "abacaba" there and replace all remaining question marks with 'z'.

for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    print(can_form_abacaba(s))  # Call the function for each test case
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function `can_form_abacaba` checks for valid placements of "abacaba" in the string.
- It counts how many valid placements exist and records the position of the first valid placement.
- If exactly one valid placement is found, it constructs the new string by placing "abacaba" and replacing remaining question marks with 'z'.
- If no valid placements are found, it checks if placing "abacaba" in any position results in exactly one occurrence.
- Finally, it returns "Yes" with the modified string or "No" if it's not possible to achieve the desired condition.

This code should now correctly handle all test cases as specified in the problem statement.

INFO - raw_msg:
 Based on the previous analysis and the insights gained, I will now provide a corrected solution to the original problem of replacing question marks in a string to ensure that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once.

### Key Steps in the Revised Solution:
1. **Count Occurrences**: We will check how many times "abacaba" can be formed in the string.
2. **Place "abacaba"**: If we find exactly one valid position, we will place "abacaba" there and replace all remaining question marks with 'z'.
3. **Final Check**: After placing "abacaba", we will check the entire string to ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed.

Hereâ€™s the corrected Python code:

```python
def can_form_abacaba(s):
    target = "abacaba"
    n = len(s)
    count = 0
    position = -1
    
    # Check for all possible positions to place "abacaba"
    for i in range(n - 6):
        can_form = True

                can_form = False
                break
        if can_form:
            count += 1
            position = i  # Store the position where we can place "abacaba"
    
    if count > 1:  # More than one occurrence found
        return "No"
    
    if count == 1:  # Exactly one occurrence found
        # Create a new string with "abacaba" placed
        new_s = list(s)
        for j in range(7):
            new_s[position + j] = target[j]
        # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
        new_s = ''.join(new_s).replace('?', 'z')
        # Check if "abacaba" appears more than once
        if new_s.count(target) == 1:
            return "Yes\n" + new_s
        else:
            return "No"
    
    # If no occurrence found, try to place "abacaba" in the first valid position

        can_form = True

            # Check if "abacaba" appears more than once
            if new_s.count(target) == 1:
                return "Yes\n" + new_s
            else:

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).

-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to determine if we can replace question marks in a given string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If possible, we should provide the modified string; otherwise, we should indicate that it's not possible.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   We will iterate through the string to find potential positions where "abacaba" can fit. For each position, we will check if the substring can be formed by replacing question marks and ensuring that no other "abacaba" can be formed elsewhere in the string. If we find a valid configuration, we will replace the remaining question marks with any letter (e.g., 'z') to complete the string. If we cannot find a valid configuration, we will return "No".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_form_abacaba(s):
       count = 0
       for i from 0 to len(s) - 7:
           if s[i:i+7] can form "abacaba":
               count += 1
               if count > 1:
                   return "No"
       if count == 1:
           replace remaining '?' with 'z'
           return "Yes" and the modified string

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to replace question marks in the string such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If "abacaba" can be formed in multiple ways or if it appears more than once after replacements, we should return "No".

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the case where "abacaba" can be formed in multiple positions. It only checks for one occurrence and does not account for the possibility of overlapping occurrences.
   - The replacement of remaining question marks with 'z' is not handled correctly. If "abacaba" is placed in the string, we should ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed by the remaining characters.
   - The logic for checking if "abacaba" can be formed does not account for the fact that if we place "abacaba" in one position, we need to ensure that no other part of the string can also form "abacaba".

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - I did not properly check for overlapping occurrences of "abacaba". The code should ensure that after placing "abacaba", no other substring can match it.
   - The logic for replacing question marks was too simplistic and did not consider the context of the string after placing "abacaba".

### Revised Approach:
1. **Count Occurrences**: First, we will count how many times "abacaba" can be formed in the string.
2. **Place "abacaba"**: If we find exactly one valid position, we will place "abacaba" there and replace all remaining question marks with 'z'.
3. **Final Check**: After placing "abacaba", we will check the entire string to ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed.

### Revised Code:
```python
def can_form_abacaba(s):
    target = "abacaba"
    count = 0
    n = len(s)
    
    # Check for all possible positions to place "abacaba"

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Based on the insights and reflections from the previous attempts, I will now provide a corrected solution to the original problem of replacing question marks in a string to ensure that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once.

### Key Steps in the Revised Solution:
1. **Count Occurrences**: We will check how many times "abacaba" can be formed in the string.
2. **Place "abacaba"**: If we find exactly one valid position, we will place "abacaba" there and replace all remaining question marks with 'z'.
3. **Final Check**: After placing "abacaba", we will check the entire string to ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def can_form_abacaba(s):
    target = "abacaba"
    n = len(s)
    count = 0
    position = -1
    
    # Check for all possible positions to place "abacaba"
    for i in range(n - 6):
        can_form = True
        for j in range(7):
            if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                can_form = False
                break
        if can_form:
            count += 1
            position = i  # Store the position where we can place "abacaba"
    
    if count == 1:  # Exactly one occurrence found
        # Create a new string with "abacaba" placed
        new_s = list(s)
        for j in range(7):
            new_s[position + j] = target[j]
        # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
        new_s = ''.join(new_s).replace('?', 'z')
        return "Yes\n" + new_s
    
    # If no occurrence found, try to place "abacaba" in the first valid position
    if count == 0:
        for i in range(n - 6):
            can_form = True
            for j in range(7):
                if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                    can_form = False
                    break
            if can_form:
                # Create a new string with "abacaba" placed
                new_s = list(s)
                for j in range(7):
                    new_s[i + j] = target[j]
                # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                new_s = ''.join(new_s).replace('?', 'z')
                # Check if "abacaba" appears more than once
                if new_s.count(target) == 1:
                    return "Yes\n" + new_s
                else:
                    return "No"
    
    return "No"

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    print(can_form_abacaba(s))  # Call the function for each test case
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function `can_form_abacaba` checks for valid placements of "abacaba" in the string.
- It counts how many valid placements exist and records the position of the first valid placement.
- If exactly one valid placement is found, it constructs the new string by placing "abacaba" and replacing remaining question marks with 'z'.
- If no valid placements are found, it checks if placing "abacaba" in any position results in exactly one occurrence.
- Finally, it returns "Yes" with the modified string or "No" if it's not possible to achieve the desired condition.

This code should now correctly handle all test cases as specified in the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step again to identify why the code is not passing all the tests.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to replace question marks in a string such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If it can be formed in multiple ways or if it appears more than once after replacements, we should return "No".

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the case where "abacaba" can be formed in multiple positions. It only checks for one occurrence and does not account for the possibility of overlapping occurrences.
   - The logic for checking if "abacaba" can be formed does not account for the fact that if we place "abacaba" in one position, we need to ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed elsewhere in the string.
   - The code does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple question marks and how they can be replaced to ensure that "abacaba" appears exactly once.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - I did not properly check for overlapping occurrences of "abacaba". The code should ensure that after placing "abacaba", no other substring can match it.
   - The logic for replacing question marks was too simplistic and did not consider the context of the string after placing "abacaba".

### Revised Approach:
1. **Count Occurrences**: First, we will check how many times "abacaba" can be formed in the string.
2. **Place "abacaba"**: If we find exactly one valid position, we will place "abacaba" there and replace all remaining question marks with 'z'.

    return "No"

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    print(can_form_abacaba(s))  # Call the function for each test case
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function `can_form_abacaba` checks for valid placements of "abacaba" in the string.
- It counts how many valid placements exist and records the position of the first valid placement.
- If exactly one valid placement is found, it constructs the new string by placing "abacaba" and replacing remaining question marks with 'z'.
- If no valid placements are found, it checks if placing "abacaba" in any position results in exactly one occurrence.
- Finally, it returns "Yes" with the modified string or "No" if it's not possible to achieve the desired condition.

This code should now correctly handle all test cases as specified in the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] ### Summary of Attempts

The problem involved replacing question marks in a string to ensure that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. The main challenge was to identify valid placements for "abacaba" while ensuring that no other occurrences could be formed after replacements.

**Key Concepts:**
- The solution required checking all possible positions in the string where "abacaba" could fit, considering both existing characters and question marks.
- It was crucial to ensure that after placing "abacaba," the resulting string did not contain any additional occurrences of the substring.

**Strategies and Issues:**
- The initial approach involved counting potential placements and checking for overlaps. However, it failed to correctly handle cases where multiple valid placements could exist or where question marks could lead to unintended additional occurrences of "abacaba."
- The logic for replacing question marks was too simplistic, leading to incorrect outputs when multiple question marks were present.

**Final Insights:**
- A more robust solution would involve a thorough check after placing "abacaba" to ensure that it appears exactly once in the final string.
- The need to replace remaining question marks with a consistent character (like 'z') was essential to avoid creating new occurrences of "abacaba."

### Code Snippet
The following code snippet represents the final approach that was attempted:

```python
def can_form_abacaba(s):
    target = "abacaba"
    n = len(s)
    count = 0
    position = -1
    
    # Check for all possible positions to place "abacaba"
    for i in range(n - 6):
        can_form = True
        for j in range(7):
            if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                can_form = False
                break
        if can_form:
            count += 1
            position = i  # Store the position where we can place "abacaba"
    
    if count > 1:  # More than one occurrence found
        return "No"
    
    if count == 1:  # Exactly one occurrence found
        new_s = list(s)
        for j in range(7):
            new_s[position + j] = target[j]
        new_s = ''.join(new_s).replace('?', 'z')
        if new_s.count(target) == 1:
            return "Yes\n" + new_s
        else:
            return "No"
    
    # If no occurrence found, try to place "abacaba" in the first valid position
    for i in range(n - 6):
        can_form = True
        for j in range(7):
            if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                can_form = False
                break
        if can_form:
            new_s = list(s)

                new_s[i + j] = target[j]
            new_s = ''.join(new_s).replace('?', 'z')
            if new_s.count(target) == 1:
                return "Yes\n" + new_s
            else:
                return "No"

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


-----Input-----

First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


-----Output-----

For each test case output an answer for it.

In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


-----Example-----
Input
6
7
abacaba
7
???????
11
aba?abacaba
11
abacaba?aba
15
asdf???f???qwer
11
abacabacaba

Output
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abacaba
Yes
abadabacaba
Yes
abacabadaba
No
No



-----Note-----

In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to determine if we can replace question marks in a given string with lowercase letters such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If possible, we should provide the modified string; otherwise, we should indicate that it's not possible.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   We will iterate through the string to find potential positions where "abacaba" can fit. For each position, we will check if the substring can be formed by replacing question marks and ensuring that no other "abacaba" can be formed elsewhere in the string. If we find a valid configuration, we will replace the remaining question marks with any letter (e.g., 'z') to complete the string. If we cannot find a valid configuration, we will return "No".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_form_abacaba(s):
       count = 0
       for i from 0 to len(s) - 7:
           if s[i:i+7] can form "abacaba":
               count += 1
               if count > 1:
                   return "No"
       if count == 1:
           replace remaining '?' with 'z'
           return "Yes" and the modified string

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to replace question marks in the string such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If "abacaba" can be formed in multiple ways or if it appears more than once after replacements, we should return "No".

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the case where "abacaba" can be formed in multiple positions. It only checks for one occurrence and does not account for the possibility of overlapping occurrences.
   - The replacement of remaining question marks with 'z' is not handled correctly. If "abacaba" is placed in the string, we should ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed by the remaining characters.
   - The logic for checking if "abacaba" can be formed does not account for the fact that if we place "abacaba" in one position, we need to ensure that no other part of the string can also form "abacaba".

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - I did not properly check for overlapping occurrences of "abacaba". The code should ensure that after placing "abacaba", no other substring can match it.
   - The logic for replacing question marks was too simplistic and did not consider the context of the string after placing "abacaba".

### Revised Approach:
1. **Count Occurrences**: First, we will count how many times "abacaba" can be formed in the string.
2. **Place "abacaba"**: If we find exactly one valid position, we will place "abacaba" there and replace all remaining question marks with 'z'.
3. **Final Check**: After placing "abacaba", we will check the entire string to ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed.

### Revised Code:
```python
def can_form_abacaba(s):
    target = "abacaba"
    count = 0
    n = len(s)
    
    # Check for all possible positions to place "abacaba"

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function `can_form_abacaba` checks for valid placements of "abacaba" in the string.
- It counts how many valid placements exist and records the position of the first valid placement.
- If exactly one valid placement is found, it constructs the new string by placing "abacaba" and replacing remaining question marks with 'z'.
- If no valid placements are found, it checks if placing "abacaba" in any position results in exactly one occurrence.
- Finally, it returns "Yes" with the modified string or "No" if it's not possible to achieve the desired condition.

This code should now correctly handle all test cases as specified in the problem statement.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step again to identify why the code is not passing all the tests.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to replace question marks in a string such that the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once. If it can be formed in multiple ways or if it appears more than once after replacements, we should return "No".

2. **Identifying the Issues**:
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the case where "abacaba" can be formed in multiple positions. It only checks for one occurrence and does not account for the possibility of overlapping occurrences.
   - The logic for checking if "abacaba" can be formed does not account for the fact that if we place "abacaba" in one position, we need to ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed elsewhere in the string.
   - The code does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple question marks and how they can be replaced to ensure that "abacaba" appears exactly once.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - I did not properly check for overlapping occurrences of "abacaba". The code should ensure that after placing "abacaba", no other substring can match it.
   - The logic for replacing question marks was too simplistic and did not consider the context of the string after placing "abacaba".

### Revised Approach:
1. **Count Occurrences**: First, we will check how many times "abacaba" can be formed in the string.
2. **Place "abacaba"**: If we find exactly one valid position, we will place "abacaba" there and replace all remaining question marks with 'z'.
3. **Final Check**: After placing "abacaba", we will check the entire string to ensure that no other "abacaba" can be formed.

### Revised Code:
```python
def can_form_abacaba(s):
    target = "abacaba"
    n = len(s)
    count = 0
    position = -1
    
    # Check for all possible positions to place "abacaba"
    for i in range(n - 6):
        can_form = True

            new_s[position + j] = target[j]

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function `can_form_abacaba` checks for valid placements of "abacaba" in the string.
- It counts how many valid placements exist and records the position of the first valid placement.

INFO - [Task id] 28 [generation text] In reflecting on my attempts to solve the problem of ensuring the substring "abacaba" appears exactly once in a given string with question marks, I recognize several key insights from both my approach and the official solution.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:
1. **Counting Occurrences**: The official solution effectively counts how many times "abacaba" appears in the string using a straightforward loop. This is crucial for determining if the string can be modified to meet the requirements.

2. **Handling Multiple Occurrences**: The solution checks if "abacaba" appears more than once right at the start. If it does, it immediately returns "No", which is efficient and avoids unnecessary computations.

3. **Constructive Replacement**: When no occurrences are found, the solution attempts to construct a valid string by iterating through potential starting positions for "abacaba". It uses a nested loop to check if "abacaba" can fit at each position, replacing question marks as needed.

4. **Final Validation**: After constructing a candidate string, the solution checks again to ensure that "abacaba" appears exactly once. This double-checking is essential to ensure correctness.

5. **Efficient Replacement of Question Marks**: The solution replaces all remaining question marks with 'z' after placing "abacaba", ensuring that the string is fully formed and meets the requirements.

### Reasons for My Approach's Failure:
- **Overlapping Occurrences**: My implementation did not adequately account for overlapping occurrences of "abacaba". The official solution's method of checking for occurrences after attempting to place "abacaba" is more robust.
- **Inefficient Handling of Question Marks**: My approach did not effectively manage the replacement of question marks, leading to potential invalid strings. The official solution's method of constructing a candidate string is clearer and more effective.
- **Lack of Immediate Feedback**: The official solution provides immediate feedback when multiple occurrences are found, while my approach continued to process unnecessarily.

### Conclusion:
The official solution's structured approach to counting, constructing, and validating the string is a valuable lesson in problem-solving. It emphasizes the importance of clear logic flow and efficient handling of conditions, particularly in competitive programming scenarios. Moving forward, I will incorporate these insights into my problem-solving strategies, especially regarding counting occurrences and validating conditions after modifications.
