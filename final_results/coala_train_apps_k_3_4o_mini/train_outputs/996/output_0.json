    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The problem involves determining the winner of a billiards game played over several rounds. Each round has two players who score points, and at the end of each round, we need to calculate the cumulative scores for both players. The winner is the player who had the highest lead (the difference between their score and the opponent's score) at any point during the game.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Read the number of rounds and the scores for each player in each round.\n   - Maintain cumulative scores for both players as we process each round.\n   - Calculate the lead for each player after each round and keep track of the maximum lead and the corresponding player.\n   - Finally, output the player with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_winner():\n       read N (number of rounds)\n       initialize cumulative_score_player1 = 0\n       initialize cumulative_score_player2 = 0\n       initialize max_lead = 0\n       initialize winner = 0\n\n       for each round from 1 to N:\n           read scores for player1 and player2\n           update cumulative scores for both players\n           calculate lead = absolute difference between cumulative scores\n           if lead > max_lead:\n               update max_lead\n               update winner based on which player has the higher score\n\n       output winner and max_lead\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_winner():\n    # Read the number of rounds\n    N = int(input())\n    \n    # Initialize cumulative scores for both players\n    cumulative_score_player1 = 0\n    cumulative_score_player2 = 0\n    \n    # Initialize variables to track the maximum lead and the winner\n    max_lead = 0\n    winner = 0\n\n    # Process each round\n    for _ in range(N):\n        # Read the scores for player 1 and player 2\n        scores = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        score_player1 = scores[0]\n        score_player2 = scores[1]\n        \n        # Update cumulative scores\n        cumulative_score_player1 += score_player1\n        cumulative_score_player2 += score_player2\n        \n        # Calculate the lead\n        if cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:\n            lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2\n            current_winner = 1\n        else:\n            lead = cumulative_score_player2 - cumulative_score_player1\n            current_winner = 2\n        \n        # Update max lead and winner if the current lead is greater\n        if lead > max_lead:\n            max_lead = lead\n            winner = current_winner\n\n    # Output the winner and the maximum lead\n    print(winner, max_lead)\n\nfind_winner()\n```",
