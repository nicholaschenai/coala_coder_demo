Well, there is more to it, but for our\npurposes this is sufficient.\nThe game consists of several rounds and in each round both players\nobtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds\nhave been played, the total score of each player is determined by\nadding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher\ntotal score is declared the winner.\nThe Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where\nthe top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager\nof Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by\nchanging the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the\nend of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once\nall the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the\nend of any round in the game is declared the winner.\n\nConsider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:\nRoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890\n\nThe total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after\neach round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23\nNote that the above table contains the cumulative scores.\nThe winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58\nat the end of round 1) during the game.\nYour task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning\nlead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will\nalways be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.\nInput\nThe first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N\n\u2264 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines\n2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.\nLine i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1\nand 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 \u2264 Si \u2264\n1000 and 1 \u2264 Ti \u2264 1000.  \nOutput\nYour output must consist of a single line containing two integers\nW and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the\nmaximum lead attained by the winner.\nExample\nInput:\n5\n140 82\n89 134\n90 110\n112 106\n88 90\n\nOutput:\n1 58\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The core concept involved analyzing the game state recursively to identify winning and losing positions. The main strategies included checking if subtracting 1 or dividing by odd divisors could lead to a winning move.\n\n    The solution utilized a recursive function with memoization to optimize repeated calculations for the same values of \\( N \\). The base case was straightforward: if \\( N \\) is 1, the current player loses. The function checked for possible moves and stored results in a dictionary to avoid redundant computations.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled multiple test cases and produced the correct output. The key takeaway was the importance of memoization in recursive problems to enhance performance, especially when dealing with potentially large values of \\( N \\) (up to \\( 10^9 \\)). The approach of checking both subtracting 1 and odd divisors was effective in determining the winner efficiently. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_win(N, memo):\n        if N == 1:\n            return False\n        if N in memo:\n            return memo[N]\n    \n        if not can_win(N - 1, memo):\n            memo[N] = True\n            return True\n    \n        for d in range(3, N + 1, 2):\n            if N % d == 0:\n                if not can_win(N // d, memo):\n                    memo[N] = True\n                    return True\n    \n        memo[N] = False\n        return False\n\n    def main():\n        T = int(input())\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            memo = {}\n            if can_win(N, memo):\n                print(\"Me\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Grinch\")\n\n    main()\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the value of recursive strategies combined with memoization for solving game theory problems efficiently.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to calculate the mean of maximum scores for students after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve, which are assigned to specific ranges of students based on their roll numbers.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the efficient updating of scores for a range of students based on multiple queries. The approach involved initializing a list of scores, iterating through each question, and updating the scores for the specified range. The final mean score was calculated by summing the scores and dividing by the number of students, using integer division to obtain the floor value.\n\n    The solution was implemented successfully without any errors, and the provided code snippet effectively handled the input and output requirements. The key takeaway was the importance of managing score updates efficiently, especially given the constraints where both the number of students and questions could be large (up to 100,000). The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_mean_scores(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, M = map(int, input().split())\n            scores = [10] * N\n            for _ in range(M):\n                i, j, k = map(int, input().split())\n                for student in range(i - 1, j):\n                    scores[student] *= k\n            total_score = sum(scores)\n            mean_score = total_score // N\n            print(mean_score)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    calculate_mean_scores(T)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements and efficiently managing data updates in programming challenges.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the problems created by his setters, the number of problems needed for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the available days to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging simple loops and arithmetic.\n\n    The final implementation was clean and efficient, successfully passing all provided test cases. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all edge cases (like having fewer problems than needed for a single contest) are considered. The solution was implemented without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints given. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_contests(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    max_contests(T)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of clear problem understanding and systematic solution development.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This sets a clear starting point for score accumulation.\n\n2. **Single Loop for Input Processing**: The solution processes the input in a single loop, reading scores for both players and updating their cumulative scores immediately.

This final comparison is straightforward and avoids unnecessary complexity.\n\nOverall, the official solution is efficient and clear, leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional checks to achieve the desired outcome.
