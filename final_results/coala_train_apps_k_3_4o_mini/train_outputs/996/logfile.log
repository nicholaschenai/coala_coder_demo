## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
purposes this is sufficient.
The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
total score is declared the winner.
The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
RoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890

The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
each round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23
Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
at the end of round 1) during the game.
Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
Input
The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
â‰¤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 â‰¤ Si â‰¤
1000 and 1 â‰¤ Ti â‰¤ 1000.  
Output
Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
maximum lead attained by the winner.
Example
Input:
5
140 82
89 134
90 110

INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to determine the winner of a billiards game between two players based on their scores over several rounds. Instead of simply summing the scores, we will track the cumulative scores after each round and identify which player had the highest lead at any point during the game. The player with the maximum lead at the end of any round will be declared the winner, along with the value of that lead.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Read the number of rounds.
   - Initialize cumulative scores for both players to zero.
   - For each round, update the cumulative scores based on the scores provided.
   - Calculate the lead for the current round and determine which player is leading.
   - Keep track of the maximum lead and the corresponding player throughout all rounds.
   - Finally, output the player number with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Read integer N (number of rounds)
   Initialize cumulative_score_player1 = 0
   Initialize cumulative_score_player2 = 0
   Initialize max_lead = 0
   Initialize winner = 0

   For each round from 1 to N:
       Read scores Si (Player 1) and Ti (Player 2)
       Update cumulative_score_player1 += Si
       Update cumulative_score_player2 += Ti
       
       If cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:
           lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2
           If lead > max_lead:
               max_lead = lead
               winner = 1
       Else:
           lead = cumulative_score_player2 - cumulative_score_player1
           If lead > max_lead:
               max_lead = lead
               winner = 2

   Output winner and max_lead
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def find_winner():
    # Read the number of rounds
    N = int(input())
    
    # Initialize cumulative scores for both players
    cumulative_score_player1 = 0
    cumulative_score_player2 = 0
    
    # Initialize variables to track the maximum lead and the winner
    max_lead = 0
    winner = 0

    # Process each round
    for _ in range(N):

        # Determine the lead and the leader
        if cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:
            lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2
            if lead > max_lead:
                max_lead = lead
                winner = 1

            if lead > max_lead:
                max_lead = lead
                winner = 2

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine the winner of a game played with a number \( N \) based on specific move rules. The core concept involved analyzing the game state recursively to identify winning and losing positions. The main strategies included checking if subtracting 1 or dividing by odd divisors could lead to a winning move.

    The solution utilized a recursive function with memoization to optimize repeated calculations for the same values of \( N \). The base case was straightforward: if \( N \) is 1, the current player loses. The function checked for possible moves and stored results in a dictionary to avoid redundant computations.

    The final implementation successfully handled multiple test cases and produced the correct output. The key takeaway was the importance of memoization in recursive problems to enhance performance, especially when dealing with potentially large values of \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)). The approach of checking both subtracting 1 and odd divisors was effective in determining the winner efficiently. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_win(N, memo):
        if N == 1:
            return False
        if N in memo:
            return memo[N]
    
        if not can_win(N - 1, memo):
            memo[N] = True
            return True
    
        for d in range(3, N + 1, 2):
            if N % d == 0:
                if not can_win(N // d, memo):
                    memo[N] = True
                    return True
    
        memo[N] = False
        return False

    def main():
        T = int(input())
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            memo = {}
            if can_win(N, memo):
                print("Me")
            else:
                print("Grinch")

    main()
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the value of recursive strategies combined with memoization for solving game theory problems efficiently.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to calculate the mean of maximum scores for students after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve, which are assigned to specific ranges of students based on their roll numbers.

    The core concept tested here was the efficient updating of scores for a range of students based on multiple queries. The approach involved initializing a list of scores, iterating through each question, and updating the scores for the specified range. The final mean score was calculated by summing the scores and dividing by the number of students, using integer division to obtain the floor value.

    The solution was implemented successfully without any errors, and the provided code snippet effectively handled the input and output requirements. The key takeaway was the importance of managing score updates efficiently, especially given the constraints where both the number of students and questions could be large (up to 100,000). The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_mean_scores(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, M = map(int, input().split())
            scores = [10] * N
            for _ in range(M):
                i, j, k = map(int, input().split())
                for student in range(i - 1, j):
                    scores[student] *= k
            total_score = sum(scores)
            mean_score = total_score // N
            print(mean_score)

    T = int(input())
    calculate_mean_scores(T)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements and efficiently managing data updates in programming challenges.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the problems created by his setters, the number of problems needed for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the available days to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging simple loops and arithmetic.

    The final implementation was clean and efficient, successfully passing all provided test cases. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all edge cases (like having fewer problems than needed for a single contest) are considered. The solution was implemented without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints given. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def max_contests(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    max_contests(T)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of clear problem understanding and systematic solution development.

INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves determining the winner of a billiards game played over several rounds. Each round has two players who score points, and at the end of each round, we need to calculate the cumulative scores for both players. The winner is the player who had the highest lead (the difference between their score and the opponent's score) at any point during the game.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Read the number of rounds and the scores for each player in each round.
   - Maintain cumulative scores for both players as we process each round.
   - Calculate the lead for each player after each round and keep track of the maximum lead and the corresponding player.
   - Finally, output the player with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_winner():
       read N (number of rounds)
       initialize cumulative_score_player1 = 0
       initialize cumulative_score_player2 = 0
       initialize max_lead = 0
       initialize winner = 0

       for each round from 1 to N:
           read scores for player1 and player2
           update cumulative scores for both players
           calculate lead = absolute difference between cumulative scores
           if lead > max_lead:
               update max_lead
               update winner based on which player has the higher score

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves determining the winner of a billiards game played over several rounds. Each round has two players who score points, and at the end of each round, we need to calculate the cumulative scores for both players. The winner is the player who had the highest lead (the difference between their score and the opponent's score) at any point during the game.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Read the number of rounds and the scores for each player in each round.
   - Maintain cumulative scores for both players as we process each round.
   - Calculate the lead for each player after each round and keep track of the maximum lead and the corresponding player.
   - Finally, output the player with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_winner():
       read N (number of rounds)
       initialize cumulative_score_player1 = 0
       initialize cumulative_score_player2 = 0
       initialize max_lead = 0
       initialize winner = 0

       for each round from 1 to N:
           read scores for player1 and player2
           update cumulative scores for both players
           calculate lead = absolute difference between cumulative scores
           if lead > max_lead:

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
purposes this is sufficient.
The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
total score is declared the winner.
The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
RoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890

The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
each round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23
Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
at the end of round 1) during the game.
Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
Input
The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
â‰¤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 â‰¤ Si â‰¤
1000 and 1 â‰¤ Ti â‰¤ 1000.  
Output
Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
maximum lead attained by the winner.
Example
Input:
5
140 82
89 134
90 110
112 106

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] In this task, I was required to determine the winner of a billiards game based on scores from multiple rounds. The key concept was to track cumulative scores for two players and identify the maximum lead at any point during the game. The solution involved reading input scores, updating cumulative totals, calculating leads, and determining the player with the highest lead.

The approach I took was straightforward: I initialized cumulative scores and iterated through each round to update these scores. After calculating the lead for each round, I compared it with the maximum lead recorded so far and updated the winner accordingly. This method effectively captured the necessary logic to solve the problem.

The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test case. The code snippet used is as follows:

```python
def find_winner():
    N = int(input())
    cumulative_score_player1 = 0
    cumulative_score_player2 = 0
    max_lead = 0
    winner = 0

    for _ in range(N):
        scores = list(map(int, input().split()))
        score_player1 = scores[0]
        score_player2 = scores[1]
        
        cumulative_score_player1 += score_player1
        cumulative_score_player2 += score_player2
        
        if cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:
            lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2
            current_winner = 1
        else:
            lead = cumulative_score_player2 - cumulative_score_player1
            current_winner = 2
        
        if lead > max_lead:
            max_lead = lead
            winner = current_winner

    print(winner, max_lead)

find_winner()
```

This experience reinforced the importance of maintaining state (cumulative scores) and tracking changes (leads) throughout iterative processes, which is a common pattern in competitive programming problems.

INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] The official solution effectively simplifies the problem by maintaining two cumulative scores and tracking the maximum lead for each player in a more compact manner. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Initialization**: The solution initializes cumulative scores (`s1` for Player 1 and `s2` for Player 2) and maximum leads (`mlead1` for Player 1 and `mlead2` for Player 2) to zero. This sets a clear starting point for score accumulation.

2. **Single Loop for Input Processing**: The solution processes the input in a single loop, reading scores for both players and updating their cumulative scores immediately. This reduces the need for additional data structures and keeps the code concise.

3. **Lead Calculation**: After updating the cumulative scores, the solution checks which player is leading and calculates the lead accordingly. It uses the `max` function to update the maximum lead for the leading player, ensuring that only the highest lead is retained.

4. **Final Decision**: At the end of the loop, the solution compares the maximum leads of both players and prints the winner along with their maximum lead. This final comparison is straightforward and avoids unnecessary complexity.

Overall, the official solution is efficient and clear, leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional checks to achieve the desired outcome. My initial approach was similar in logic but could have been more concise by directly tracking maximum leads without maintaining separate cumulative scores for comparison. The official solution's use of fewer variables and direct comparisons makes it easier to follow and potentially more efficient in terms of space complexity.

[Problem]
    The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
    on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
    purposes this is sufficient.
    The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
    obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
    have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
    adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
    total score is declared the winner.
    The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
    the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
    of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
    changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
    end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
    all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
    end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

    Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
    RoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890

    The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
    each round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23
    Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
    The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
    at the end of round 1) during the game.
    Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
    lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
    always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
    Input
    The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
    â‰¤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
    2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
    Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
    and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 â‰¤ Si â‰¤
    1000 and 1 â‰¤ Ti â‰¤ 1000.  
    Output
    Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
    W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
    maximum lead attained by the winner.
    Example
    Input:
    5
    140 82
    89 134
    90 110
    112 106
