    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of indices we can visit in an array of integers by jumping from one index to another. We can jump a distance of up to `d` indices either to the left or right, but we can only jump to an index if the value at the starting index is greater than the value at the destination index and also greater than all values in between.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. Starting from each index, we will explore all possible jumps to the left and right within the allowed distance `d`. For each jump, we will check if the jump is valid (i.e., the value at the starting index is greater than the value at the destination index and all values in between). We will keep track of the maximum number of indices visited during these jumps. Since we can start from any index, we will repeat this process for each index in the array and return the maximum count found.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function maxJumps(arr, d):\n       define a helper function dfs(index, visited):\n           if index is already visited:\n               return 0\n           mark index as visited\n           max_count = 1  // count the current index\n           // check jumps to the right\n           for x from 1 to d:\n               if index + x is within bounds:\n                   if arr[index] > arr[index + x] and all values between index and index + x are less than arr[index]:\n                       max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index + x, visited))\n           // check jumps to the left\n           for x from 1 to d:\n               if index - x is within bounds:\n                   if arr[index] > arr[index - x] and all values between index and index - x are less than arr[index]:\n                       max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index - x, visited))\n           return max_count\n\n       max_jumps = 0\n       for each index in arr:\n           visited = empty set\n           max_jumps = max(max_jumps, dfs(index, visited))\n       return max_jumps\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maxJumps(self, arr: list[int], d: int) -> int:\n        # Helper function to perform DFS and count reachable indices\n        def dfs(index, visited):\n            if index in visited:\n                return 0  # If already visited, return 0\n            visited.add(index)  # Mark the current index as visited\n            max_count = 1  # Count the current index\n            # Check jumps to the right\n            for x in range(1, d + 1):\n                if index + x < len(arr):  # Ensure within bounds\n                    if arr[index] > arr[index + x] and all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index + 1, index + x)):\n                        max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index + x, visited))\n            # Check jumps to the left\n            for x in range(1, d + 1):\n                if index - x >= 0:  # Ensure within bounds\n                    if arr[index] > arr[index - x] and all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index - 1, index - x - 1, -1)):\n                        max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index - x, visited))\n            return max_count\n\n        max_jumps = 0\n        for index in range(len(arr)):\n            visited = set()  # Reset visited for each starting index\n            max_jumps = max(max_jumps, dfs(index, visited))  # Update max jumps\n        return max_jumps\n```",
