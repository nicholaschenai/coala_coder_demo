In one step you can jump from index i to index:\n\ni + x where:\u00a0i + x < arr.length and  0 <\u00a0x <= d.\ni - x where:\u00a0i - x >= 0 and  0 <\u00a0x <= d.\n\nIn addition, you can only jump from index i to index j\u00a0if arr[i] > arr[j] and arr[i] > arr[k] for all indices k between i and j (More formally min(i,\u00a0j) < k < max(i, j)).\nYou can choose any index of the array and start jumping. Return the maximum number of indices\u00a0you can visit.\nNotice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.\n\u00a0\nExample 1:\n\nInput: arr = [6,4,14,6,8,13,9,7,10,6,12], d = 2\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: You can start at index 10.

1] + 1\\right)$$\n\n    The problem of finding the maximum of a prefix of an array (which changes) is a standard problem that can be solved by many different data structures. \n    For instance we can use a [Segment tree](../data_structures/segment_tree.md) or a [Fenwick tree](../data_structures/fenwick.md).\n\n    This method has obviously some **shortcomings**:\n    in terms of length and complexity of the implementation this approach will be worse than the method using binary search.\n    In addition if the input numbers $a[i]$ are especially large, then we would have to use some tricks, like compressing the numbers (i.e. renumber them from $0$ to $n-1$), or use a dynamic segment tree (only generate the branches of the tree that are important).\n    Otherwise the memory consumption will be too high.\n\n    On the other hand this method has also some **advantages**:\n    with this method you don't have to think about any tricky properties in the dynamic programming solution.\n    And this approach allows us to generalize the problem very easily (see below).\n\n    ## Related tasks\n\n    Here are several problems that are closely related to the problem of finding the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    ### Longest non-decreasing subsequence\n\n    This is in fact nearly the same problem.\n    Only now it is allowed to use identical numbers in the subsequence.\n\n    The solution is essentially also nearly the same.\n    We just have to change the inequality signs, and make a slightly modification to the binary search.\n\n    ### Number of longest increasing subsequences\n\n    We can use the first discussed method, either the $O(n^2)$ version or the version using data structures.\n    We only have to additionally store in how many ways we can obtain longest increasing subsequences ending in the values $d[i]$.\n\n    The number of ways to form a longest increasing subsequences ending in $a[i]$ is the sum of all ways for all longest increasing subsequences ending in $j$ where $d[j]$ is maximal.\n    There can be multiple such $j$, so we need to sum all of them.\n\n    Using a Segment tree this approach can also be implemented in $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    It is not possible to use the binary search approach for this task.\n\n    ### Smallest number of non-increasing subsequences covering a sequence\n\n    For a given array with $n$ numbers $a[0 \\dots n - 1]$ we have to colorize the numbers in the smallest number of colors, so that each color forms a non-increasing subsequence.\n\n    To solve this, we notice that the minimum number of required colors is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    **Proof**:\n    We need to prove the **duality** of these two problems.\n\n    Let's denote by $x$ the length of the longest increasing subsequence and by $y$ the least number of non-increasing subsequences that form a cover.\n    We need to prove that $x = y$.\n\n    It is clear that $y < x$ is not possible, because if we have $x$ strictly increasing elements, than no two can be part of the same non-increasing subsequence.\n    Therefore we have $y \\ge x$.\n\n    We now show that $y > x$ is not possible by contradiction.\n    Suppose that $y > x$.\n    Then we consider any optimal set of $y$ non-increasing subsequences.\n    We transform this in set in the following way:\n    as long as there are two such subsequences such that the first begins before the second subsequence, and the first sequence start with a number greater than or equal to the second, then we unhook this starting number and attach it to the beginning of second.\n    After a finite number of steps we have $y$ subsequences, and their starting numbers will form an increasing subsequence of length $y$.\n    Since we assumed that $y > x$ we reached a contradiction.\n\n    Thus it follows that $y = x$.\n\n    **Restoring the sequences**:\n    The desired partition of the sequence into subsequences can be done greedily.\n    I.e. go from left to right and assign the current number or that subsequence ending with the minimal number which is greater than or equal to the current one.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In solving the problem of determining the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock after a series of smashes, I identified that the core concept revolves around partitioning the weights of the rocks. The goal is to minimize the difference between two groups of weights, which can be approached using dynamic programming.\n\n    The strategy involved calculating the total weight of the rocks and then using a dynamic programming array to track achievable sums up to half of the total weight. By iterating through each rock and updating the DP array, I was able to determine the largest sum that could be formed without exceeding the target. The final result is derived from the total weight minus twice this sum.\n\n    The implemented solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating that the approach of using dynamic programming to solve a subset sum-like problem was effective. The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:\n            total_weight = sum(stones)\n            target = total_weight // 2\n            dp = [False] * (target + 1)\n            dp[0] = True\n\n            for stone in stones:\n                for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):\n                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]\n\n            for j in range(target, -1, -1):\n                if dp[j]:\n                    return total_weight - 2 * j\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in problems and applying dynamic programming techniques to optimize solutions.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution employs a set-based dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of minimizing the weight of the last remaining stone. The key insights from this solution are as follows:\n\n    1. **Set for Dynamic Programming**: Instead of using a boolean array to track achievable weights, the official solution uses a set `dp` to store all possible sums that can be formed with the given stones. This allows for more flexibility and avoids the need for a fixed size array.\n\n    2. **Iterative Update**: For each stone, the solution updates the set `dp` by adding the current stone's weight to all previously achievable sums. This is done using a set comprehension, which efficiently generates new sums without modifying the set while iterating over it.\n\n    3. **Final Calculation**: After processing all stones, the solution calculates the minimum possible weight of the last stone by evaluating the absolute difference between the total weight and twice each achievable sum in `dp`. This effectively finds the closest partition of the stones to half of the total weight.\n\n    The official solution is more concise and leverages the properties of sets to simplify the logic. My initial approach, while correct, used a boolean array which could be less efficient in terms of space and complexity. The set-based method is particularly effective for this problem, as it directly captures all possible sums without the need for a fixed range, making it adaptable to varying input sizes. \n\n    Overall, the official solution's use of sets and its straightforward approach to updating possible sums provide valuable insights for future dynamic programming problems, especially those involving subset sums.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The jumps can only be made if the starting index's value is greater than the destination index's value and all values in between.\n\n2. **DFS Implementation**: The DFS function is designed to explore all possible jumps from a given index. However, the way the jumps are checked may not be correctly implemented. Specifically, the conditions for valid jumps might not be comprehensive enough.\n\n3. **Jump Validity Check**: The checks for valid jumps to the right and left are done using the `all()` function, which checks if all values in the specified range are less than the value at the starting index. However, the range for checking values in between might not be correctly defined, especially when checking the bounds of the indices.\n\n4. **Visited Set**: The visited set is used to prevent revisiting indices, but it is reset for each starting index. This is correct, but it may lead to missing some valid paths if the DFS does not explore all possible routes effectively.\n\n5. **Counting Indices**: The counting mechanism in the DFS function may not be correctly aggregating the maximum number of indices visited.

The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:\n            total_weight = sum(stones)\n            target = total_weight // 2\n            dp = [False] * (target + 1)\n            dp[0] = True\n\n            for stone in stones:\n                for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):\n                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]\n\n            for j in range(target, -1, -1):\n                if dp[j]:\n                    return total_weight - 2 * j\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in problems and applying dynamic programming techniques to optimize solutions.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution employs a set-based dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of minimizing the weight of the last remaining stone. The key insights from this solution are as follows:\n\n    1. **Set for Dynamic Programming**: Instead of using a boolean array to track achievable weights, the official solution uses a set `dp` to store all possible sums that can be formed with the given stones. This allows for more flexibility and avoids the need for a fixed size array.\n\n    2. **Iterative Update**: For each stone, the solution updates the set `dp` by adding the current stone's weight to all previously achievable sums. This is done using a set comprehension, which efficiently generates new sums without modifying the set while iterating over it.\n\n    3. **Final Calculation**: After processing all stones, the solution calculates the minimum possible weight of the last stone by evaluating the absolute difference between the total weight and twice each achievable sum in `dp`. This effectively finds the closest partition of the stones to half of the total weight.\n\n    The official solution is more concise and leverages the properties of sets to simplify the logic. My initial approach, while correct, used a boolean array which could be less efficient in terms of space and complexity. The set-based method is particularly effective for this problem, as it directly captures all possible sums without the need for a fixed range, making it adaptable to varying input sizes. \n\n    Overall, the official solution's use of sets and its straightforward approach to updating possible sums provide valuable insights for future dynamic programming problems, especially those involving subset sums.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.\n        Each turn, we choose any two rocks\u00a0and smash them together.\u00a0 Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.\u00a0 The result of this smash is:\n\n        If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;\n        If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.\n\n        At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.\u00a0 Return the smallest possible weight of this stone (the weight is\u00a00 if there are no stones left.)\n\u00a0\n        Example 1:\n        Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]\n        Output: 1\n        Explanation: \n        We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,\n        we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,\n        we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,\n        we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the optimal value.\n\n\u00a0\n        Note:\n\n        1 <= stones.length <= 30\n        1 <= stones[i] <= 100\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        None\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n           We have a collection of rocks, each with a positive integer weight. When we smash two rocks together, if they have the same weight, both are destroyed. If they have different weights, the lighter rock is destroyed, and the heavier rock's weight is reduced by the weight of the lighter rock. The goal is to determine the smallest possible weight of the remaining rock after performing all possible smashes.\n\n        2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: \n           The problem can be approached using dynamic programming. The idea is to consider the weights of the rocks as a set of integers and find a way to partition these weights into two groups such that the difference between the sums of the two groups is minimized. This is akin to the \"subset sum problem\" where we want to find a subset of weights that can be summed to a value as close to half of the total weight as possible. The smallest possible weight of the remaining rock will be the absolute difference between the total weight and twice the sum of the closest subset to half of the total weight.\n\n        3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n           ```\n           function lastStoneWeightII(stones):\n               total_weight = sum(stones)\n               target = total_weight // 2\n               dp = array of size (target + 1) initialized to False\n               dp[0] = True  // We can always form the sum 0\n\n               for each stone in stones:\n                   for j from target down to stone:\n                       dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]\n\n               for j from target down to 0:\n                   if dp[j] is True:\n                       return total_weight - 2 * j\n           ```\n\n        4. **Final Python Solution**:\n        ```python\n        class Solution:\n            def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:\n                # Calculate the total weight of all stones\n                total_weight = sum(stones)\n                # The target is half of the total weight\n                target = total_weight // 2\n                # Create a DP array to track achievable weights\n                dp = [False] * (target + 1)\n                dp[0] = True  # We can always form the sum 0\n\n                # Iterate through each stone\n                for stone in stones:\n                    # Update the DP array from back to front\n                    for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):\n                        dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]\n\n                # Find the largest j such that dp[j] is True\n                for j in range(target, -1, -1):\n                    if dp[j]:\n                        # The minimum possible weight of the last stone\n                        return total_weight - 2 * j\n        ```\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: [[2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 1]] Output: 1\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the code again step-by-step to identify the issues that are causing it to fail the tests:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the maximum number of indices we can visit by jumping according to the specified rules. We can jump a distance of up to `d` indices either to the left or right, but we can only jump to an index if the value at the starting index is greater than the value at the destination index and also greater than all values in between.\n\n2. **DFS Implementation**: The DFS function is designed to explore all possible jumps from a given index. However, the way the jumps are checked may not be correctly implemented. Specifically, the conditions for valid jumps might not be comprehensive enough.\n\n3. **Jump Validity Check**: The checks for valid jumps to the right and left are done using the `all()` function, which checks if all values in the specified range are less than the value at the starting index. However, the range for checking values in between might not be correctly defined, especially when checking the bounds of the indices.\n\n4. **Visited Set**: The visited set is used to prevent revisiting indices, but it is reset for each starting index. This is correct, but it may lead to missing some valid paths if the DFS does not explore all possible routes effectively.\n\n5. **Counting Indices**: The counting mechanism in the DFS function may not be correctly aggregating the maximum number of indices visited. The logic for updating `max_count` might not be capturing all valid paths.\n\n### Where I Went Wrong:\n- The checks for valid jumps may not be correctly implemented, particularly the conditions that ensure all intermediate values are less than the starting index's value.\n- The logic for counting the maximum number of indices visited might not be comprehensive enough, leading to undercounting.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo fix the code, I will:\n- Ensure that the jump validity checks correctly account for all intermediate values.\n- Refactor the DFS logic to ensure that it correctly counts all reachable indices.\n- Test the implementation with the provided examples to ensure it meets the requirements.\n\nHere\u2019s the revised code:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maxJumps(self, arr: list[int], d: int) -> int:\n        n = len(arr)\n        dp = [-1] * n  # To store the maximum jumps from each index\n        \n        def dfs(index):\n            if dp[index] != -1:\n                return dp[index]  # Return already computed result\n            \n            max_count = 1  # Count the current index\n            # Check jumps to the right\n            for x in range(1, d + 1):\n                if index + x < n and arr[index] > arr[index + x]:\n                    # Check if all values in between are less than arr[index]\n                    if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index + 1, index + x + 1)):\n                        max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index + x))\n            \n            # Check jumps to the left\n            for x in range(1, d + 1):\n                if index - x >= 0 and arr[index] > arr[index - x]:\n                    # Check if all values in between are less than arr[index]\n                    if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index - 1, index - x - 1, -1)):\n                        max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index - x))\n            \n            dp[index] = max_count  # Store the result\n            return max_count\n\n        max_jumps = 0\n        for index in range(n):\n            max_jumps = max(max_jumps, dfs(index))  # Update max jumps\n        return max_jumps\n```\n\n### Key Changes Made:\n1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: Introduced a `dp` array to store the maximum jumps from each index, which avoids redundant calculations and improves efficiency.\n2. **DFS Logic**: The logic for counting the maximum number of indices visited has been retained but is now more robust due to the improved jump checks.\n\nThis code should now correctly compute the maximum number of indices that can be visited according to the problem's constraints."

The set-based method is particularly effective for this problem, as it directly captures all possible sums without the need for a fixed range, making it adaptable to varying input sizes. \n\n    Overall, the official solution's use of sets and its straightforward approach to updating possible sums provide valuable insights for future dynamic programming problems, especially those involving subset sums.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Bit manipulation\n    Section: Dynamic programming\n    Part: 1/2\n    \\section{Dynamic programming}\n\n    Bit operations provide an efficient and convenient\n    way to implement dynamic programming algorithms\n    whose states contain subsets of elements,\n    because such states can be stored as integers.\n    Next we discuss examples of combining\n    bit operations and dynamic programming.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Optimal selection}\n\n    As a first example, consider the following problem:\n    We are given the prices of $k$ products\n    over $n$ days, and we want to buy each product\n    exactly once.\n    However, we are allowed to buy at most one product\n    in a day.\n    What is the minimum total price?\n    For example, consider the following scenario ($k=3$ and $n=8$):\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.65]\n        \\draw (0, 0) grid (8,3);\n        \\node at (-2.5,2.5) {product 0};\n        \\node at (-2.5,1.5) {product 1};\n        \\node at (-2.5,0.5) {product 2};\n\n        \\foreach \\x in {0,...,7}\n            {\\node at (\\x+0.5,3.5) {\\x};}\n        \\foreach \\x/\\v in {0/6,1/9,2/5,3/2,4/8,5/9,6/1,7/6}\n            {\\node at (\\x+0.5,2.5) {\\v};}\n        \\foreach \\x/\\v in {0/8,1/2,2/6,3/2,4/7,5/5,6/7,7/2}\n            {\\node at (\\x+0.5,1.5) {\\v};}\n        \\foreach \\x/\\v in {0/5,1/3,2/9,3/7,4/3,5/5,6/1,7/4}\n            {\\node at (\\x+0.5,0.5) {\\v};}\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    In this scenario, the minimum total price is $5$:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.65]\n        \\fill [color=lightgray] (1, 1) rectangle (2, 2);\n        \\fill [color=lightgray] (3, 2) rectangle (4, 3);\n        \\fill [color=lightgray] (6, 0) rectangle (7, 1);\n        \\draw (0, 0) grid (8,3);\n        \\node at (-2.5,2.5) {product 0};\n        \\node at (-2.5,1.5) {product 1};\n        \\node at (-2.5,0.5) {product 2};\n\n        \\foreach \\x in {0,...,7}\n            {\\node at (\\x+0.5,3.5) {\\x};}\n        \\foreach \\x/\\v in {0/6,1/9,2/5,3/2,4/8,5/9,6/1,7/6}\n            {\\node at (\\x+0.5,2.5) {\\v};}\n        \\foreach \\x/\\v in {0/8,1/2,2/6,3/2,4/7,5/5,6/7,7/2}\n            {\\node at (\\x+0.5,1.5) {\\v};}\n        \\foreach \\x/\\v in {0/5,1/3,2/9,3/7,4/3,5/5,6/1,7/4}\n            {\\node at (\\x+0.5,0.5) {\\v};}\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    Let $\\texttt{price}[x][d]$ denote the price of product $x$\n    on day $d$.\n    For example, in the above scenario $\\texttt{price}[2][3] = 7$.\n    Then, let $\\texttt{total}(S,d)$ denote the minimum total\n    price for buying a subset $S$ of products by day $d$.\n    Using this function, the solution to the problem is\n    $\\texttt{total}(\\{0 \\ldots k-1\\},n-1)$.\n\n    First, $\\texttt{total}(\\emptyset,d) = 0$,\n    because it does not cost anything to buy an empty set,\n    and $\\texttt{total}(\\{x\\},0) = \\texttt{price}[x][0]$,\n    because there is one way to buy one product on the first day.\n    Then, the following recurrence can be used:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n    \\begin{split}\n    \\texttt{total}(S,d) = \\min( & \\texttt{total}(S,d-1), \\\\\n    & \\min_{x \\in S} (\\texttt{total}(S \\setminus x,d-1)+\\texttt{price}[x][d]))\n    \\end{split}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    This means that we either do not buy any product on day $d$\n    or buy a product $x$ that belongs to $S$.\n    In the latter case, we remove $x$ from $S$ and add the\n    price of $x$ to the total price.\n\n    The next step is to calculate the values of the function\n    using dynamic programming.\n    To store the function values, we declare an array\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int total[1<<K][N];\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    where $K$ and $N$ are suitably large constants.\n    The first dimension of the array corresponds to a bit\n    representation of a subset.\n\n    First, the cases where $d=0$ can be processed as follows:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int x = 0;

Held and R. M. Karp \\cite{hel62}.}.\n    The benefit of this is that\n    $n!$, the number of permutations,\n    is much larger than $2^n$, the number of subsets.\n    For example, if $n=20$, then\n    $n! \\approx 2.4 \\cdot 10^{18}$ and $2^n \\approx 10^6$.\n    Thus, for certain values of $n$,\n    we can efficiently go through the subsets but not through the permutations.\n\n    As an example, consider the following problem:\n    There is an elevator with maximum weight $x$,\n    and $n$ people with known weights\n    who want to get from the ground floor\n    to the top floor.\n    What is the minimum number of rides needed\n    if the people enter the elevator in an optimal order?\n\n    For example, suppose that $x=10$, $n=5$\n    and the weights are as follows:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{ll}\n    person & weight \\\\\n    \\hline\n    0 & 2 \\\\\n    1 & 3 \\\\\n    2 & 3 \\\\\n    3 & 5 \\\\\n    4 & 6 \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n    In this case, the minimum number of rides is 2.\n    One optimal order is $\\{0,2,3,1,4\\}$,\n    which partitions the people into two rides:\n    first $\\{0,2,3\\}$ (total weight 10),\n    and then $\\{1,4\\}$ (total weight 9).\n\n    The problem can be easily solved in $O(n! n)$ time\n    by testing all possible permutations of $n$ people.\n    However, we can use dynamic programming to get\n    a more efficient $O(2^n n)$ time algorithm.\n    The idea is to calculate for each subset of people\n    two values: the minimum number of rides needed and\n    the minimum weight of people who ride in the last group.\n\n    Let $\\texttt{weight}[p]$ denote the weight of\n    person $p$.\n    We define two functions:\n    $\\texttt{rides}(S)$ is the minimum number of\n    rides for a subset $S$,\n    and $\\texttt{last}(S)$ is the minimum weight\n    of the last ride.\n    For example, in the above scenario\n    \\[ \\texttt{rides}(\\{1,3,4\\})=2 \\hspace{10px} \\textrm{and}\n    \\hspace{10px} \\texttt{last}(\\{1,3,4\\})=5,\\]\n    because the optimal rides are $\\{1,4\\}$ and $\\{3\\}$,\n    and the second ride has weight 5.\n    Of course, our final goal is to calculate the value\n    of $\\texttt{rides}(\\{0 \\ldots n-1\\})$.\n\n    We can calculate the values\n    of the functions recursively and then apply\n    dynamic programming.\n    The idea is to go through all people\n    who belong to $S$ and optimally\n    choose the last person $p$ who enters the elevator.\n    Each such choice yields a subproblem\n    for a smaller subset of people.\n    If $\\texttt{last}(S \\setminus p)+\\texttt{weight}[p] \\le x$,\n    we can add $p$ to the last ride.\n    Otherwise, we have to reserve a new ride\n    that initially only contains $p$.\n\n    To implement dynamic programming,\n    we declare an array\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    pair<int,int> best[1<<N];\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    that contains for each subset $S$\n    a pair $(\\texttt{rides}(S),\\texttt{last}(S))$.\n    We set the value for an empty group as follows:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    best[0] = {1,0};\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    Then, we can fill the array as follows:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int s = 1; s < (1<<n); s++) {\n        // initial value: n+1 rides are needed\n        best[s] = {n+1,0};\n        for (int p = 0; p < n; p++) {\n            if (s&(1<<p)) {\n                auto option = best[s^(1<<p)];\n                if (option.second+weight[p] <= x) {\n                    // add p to an existing ride\n                    option.second += weight[p];\n                } else {\n                    // reserve a new ride for p\n                    option.first++;\n                    option.second = weight[p];\n                }\n                best[s] = min(best[s], option);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    Note that the above loop guarantees that\n    for any two subsets $S_1$ and $S_2$\n    such that $S_1 \\subset S_2$, we process $S_1$ before $S_2$.\n    Thus, the dynamic programming values are calculated in the\n    correct order.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Counting subsets}\n\n    Our last problem in this chapter is as follows:\n    Let $X=\\{0 \\ldots n-1\\}$, and each subset $S \\subset X$\n    is assigned an integer $\\texttt{value}[S]$.\n    Our task is to calculate for each $S$\n    \\[\\texttt{sum}(S) = \\sum_{A \\subset S} \\texttt{value}[A],\\]\n    i.e., the sum of values of subsets of $S$.\n\n    For example, suppose that $n=3\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

This allows for quick access to previous indices that can be jumped to, based on the conditions specified.\n\n2. **Handling Equal Heights**: The official solution effectively manages cases where multiple indices have the same height. By using a list to store indices of the same height, it ensures that all potential jumps are considered without missing any valid paths.\n\n3. **Boundary Conditions**: The solution cleverly adds a sentinel value (a very large number) to the end of the array. This helps in simplifying the logic for determining valid jumps, as it ensures that all indices are processed without needing additional boundary checks.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The use of a stack allows the solution to maintain a time complexity of O(n), as each index is pushed and popped from the stack at most once. This is a significant improvement over the recursive DFS approach, which can lead to redundant calculations and higher time complexity.\n\n### Comparison with My Approach:\n- My initial approach relied on a recursive DFS method with memoization, which, while functional, was less efficient due to the potential for redundant calculations and the complexity of managing the jump conditions.\n- The official solution's use of a stack to manage jumps and the handling of equal heights provided a more streamlined and efficient way to solve the problem.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe official solution demonstrates a more effective strategy for solving the problem by leveraging dynamic programming and stack data structures. This experience highlights the importance of considering different data structures and algorithms when approaching complex problems, particularly those involving conditions and constraints on jumps or movements."
