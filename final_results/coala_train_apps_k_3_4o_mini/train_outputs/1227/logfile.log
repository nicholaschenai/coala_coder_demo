## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
One day, Chef found a cube which has each of its sides painted in some color out of black, blue, red, green, yellow and orange.
Now he asks you to check if he can choose three sides such that they are pairwise adjacent and painted in the same color.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- A single line of each test case contains six words denoting the colors of painted sides in the order: front, back, left, right, top and bottom, respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing the word "YES" or "NO" (without quotes) corresponding to the answer of the problem.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤  50000 
- Each color will be from the list {"black", "blue", "red", "green", "yellow", "orange"}

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask 1: (25 points)
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤  12000

2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem requires us to determine if there are three adjacent sides of a cube that are painted the same color. Each test case provides the colors of the six sides of the cube, and we need to check for each test case if such a triplet of adjacent sides exists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to identify the sets of three sides that are adjacent to each other on a cube. The pairs of adjacent sides can be grouped as follows:
   - Front, Left, Top
   - Front, Right, Top
   - Back, Left, Top
   - Back, Right, Top
   - Front, Left, Bottom
   - Front, Right, Bottom
   - Back, Left, Bottom
   - Back, Right, Bottom

   For each test case, we will check if any of these groups of three sides have the same color. If we find at least one such group, we will output "YES"; otherwise, we will output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function check_adjacent_colors(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read colors for front, back, left, right, top, bottom
           check the following combinations:
               if (front == left == top) or
                  (front == right == top) or
                  (back == left == top) or
                  (back == right == top) or
                  (front == left == bottom) or
                  (front == right == bottom) or
                  (back == left == bottom) or
                  (back == right == bottom):
                   output "YES"
               else:
                   output "NO"
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def check_adjacent_colors(test_cases):
    results = []
    for colors in test_cases:
        front, back, left, right, top, bottom = colors

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to count the number of triangles that can be formed using points of the same color from a given list of colored points in a 2D plane. The output needed to include the total number of points, unique colors, total triangles, and the color(s) with the maximum number of triangles along with their counts.

    Key concepts involved:
    - Grouping points by color using a dictionary.
    - Using combinations to generate sets of three points and checking for collinearity using the determinant method.
    - Collecting statistics and formatting the output correctly.

    The main issues encountered were related to the output format. Initially, I returned the color(s) with the maximum triangles and their count in a nested list, which did not match the expected output structure. The correct format required a flat list containing the colors followed by the count, rather than wrapping them in an additional list.

    The final implementation corrected this by ensuring the output was structured as `[total_points, total_colors, total_triangles, max_colors, max_triangles]`, where `max_colors` is a list of colors and `max_triangles` is the count of triangles for those colors.

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def count_col_triang(points):
        from collections import defaultdict
        from itertools import combinations

        # Group points by color
        color_points = defaultdict(list)
        for point in points:
            color_points[point[1]].append(point[0])

        # Initialize statistics
        total_points = len(points)
        total_colors = len(color_points)
        total_triangles = 0
        triangles_by_color = {}

        # Calculate triangles for each color
        for color, pts in color_points.items():
            num_points = len(pts)
            if num_points >= 3:
                triangles_count = 0
                for p1, p2, p3 in combinations(pts, 3):
                    if (p1[0] * (p2[1] - p3[1]) + p2[0] * (p3[1] - p1[1]) + p3[0] * (p1[1] - p2[1])) != 0:
                        triangles_count += 1
                total_triangles += triangles_count
                triangles_by_color[color] = triangles_count

        # Determine the color(s) with the maximum number of triangles
        max_triangles = max(triangles_by_color.values(), default=0)
        max_colors = sorted([color for color, count in triangles_by_color.items() if count == max_triangles])

        # Return the results
        return [total_points, total_colors, total_triangles, max_colors, max_triangles]
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully adhering to output specifications and the need for thorough testing to ensure all edge cases are handled correctly.
[/Summary]


[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        You are given $n$ intervals on the $X$ axis. Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:
        - White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval
        - Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.
        - Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.
        - Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.
        You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.

        -----Input:-----
        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
        - The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.
        - The $i^{\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval.

        -----Output:-----
        For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $ 1 \leq T \leq 10^5 $
        - $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $
        - The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.
        - $ 1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \leq i \leq n$.

        -----Sample Input:-----
        1
        3
        3 7
        2 5
        6 9

        -----Sample Output:-----
        100

        -----Explanation:-----
        The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:
        - $[2, 3) \cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.
        - $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.
        - $[3, 5] \cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.
        - Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.
        Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.
        Note that 011 is also a valid output.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
           The task is to color a set of intervals on the X-axis either blue or yellow in such a way that the total length of the area that is colored green (where both blue and yellow intervals overlap) is maximized. Each interval can only be colored one way, and we need to determine the optimal coloring for multiple test cases.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           To maximize the green area, we should look for overlaps between intervals. If two intervals overlap, we can color one blue and the other yellow to create a green area. The strategy involves sorting the intervals and then iterating through them to determine overlaps. We can keep track of the last colored interval and decide the color of the current interval based on whether it overlaps with the last one.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
               for each test_case in test_cases:
                   read number of intervals n
                   read intervals into a list
                   sort intervals by their starting point
                   initialize a result string
                   last_color = None
                   for each interval in intervals:
                       if last_color is None:
                           color the interval blue
                           last_color = blue
                       else if interval overlaps with last colored interval:
                           color the interval yellow
                           last_color = yellow
                       else:
                           color the interval blue
                           last_color = blue
                   append the result string for this test_case
               return all result strings
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the key concept revolves around understanding how two different methods of distributing apples into boxes can lead to different outcomes. The first candidate distributes apples evenly, while the second candidate can create uneven distributions by filling the box with the least apples. The critical insight is that if K (the number of boxes) is 1, both candidates will yield the same result, while for K greater than 1, the distributions can differ.

    The solution involves a straightforward conditional check on the value of K. If K equals 1, the output is "NO"; otherwise, it is "YES". This logic is efficient and works within the constraints provided, as it only requires a simple comparison for each test case.

    The final implementation reads the number of test cases and processes each case by checking the value of K, printing the appropriate response. The code is clean and efficient, handling the maximum constraints without any issues. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_apples(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, input().split())
            if K == 1:
                print("NO")
            else:
                print("YES")

    T = int(input())
    can_distribute_apples(T)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the implications of the problem constraints and how they affect the solution approach.

INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to determine if there are three adjacent sides of a cube that are painted the same color. Each cube has six sides, and the colors of these sides are provided as input. We need to check for each test case if there exists a combination of three sides that are adjacent and share the same color.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   A cube has specific sets of three sides that are adjacent to each other. We can represent the sides of the cube as follows:
   - Front (F)
   - Back (B)
   - Left (L)
   - Right (R)
   - Top (T)
   - Bottom (D)

   The adjacent triplets of sides are:
   - (F, L, T)
   - (F, R, T)
   - (F, L, D)
   - (F, R, D)
   - (B, L, T)
   - (B, R, T)
   - (B, L, D)
   - (B, R, D)

   For each test case, we will check these combinations to see if any of them are painted the same color. If we find at least one such combination, we will output "YES"; otherwise, we will output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function check_adjacent_colors(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read colors of the six sides
           check each of the eight combinations of adjacent sides
           if any combination has the same color:

INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine if there are three adjacent sides of a cube painted the same color based on given inputs. The cube has six sides, and the adjacency of sides was defined by specific combinations. The solution involved checking these combinations for each test case.

The core concept was to identify the eight possible combinations of three adjacent sides and check if they all share the same color. The implementation was straightforward, using simple conditional checks to compare the colors of the sides.

The final solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating that the approach of directly checking the combinations worked well. The code utilized basic input handling and conditional logic without any external libraries, adhering to the problem constraints. 

Hereâ€™s the key code snippet for reference:

```python
def can_choose_three_adjacent_sides(T):
    for _ in range(T):
        colors = input().split()
        if (colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # F, L, T

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] The official solution effectively checks for three adjacent sides of a cube that are painted the same color by using a list of tuples to represent the indices of the sides. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's set data structure to determine if all three colors in a combination are the same.

Key insights from the official solution:

1. **Indexing**: The solution uses 1-based indexing for the sides of the cube, which is then adjusted to 0-based indexing when accessing the list of colors. This is a common practice in competitive programming to avoid off-by-one errors.

2. **Tuple Combinations**: The use of a predefined list of tuples (`a`) that represent the combinations of adjacent sides simplifies the logic. This avoids hardcoding multiple conditional checks and makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

3. **Set for Uniqueness**: By converting the selected colors into a set, the solution can easily check if all three colors are the same by checking if the length of the set is 1. This is a concise way to determine color equality.

4. **Control Flow**: The use of a flag (`c`) to indicate if a valid combination was found is a simple and effective way to manage the output logic.

Overall, the official solution is efficient and clear, making it easy to understand and modify if necessary. My initial approach was similar in logic but could have benefited from the use of sets and a more structured way to handle the combinations of adjacent sides. The official solution's use of tuples for combinations is particularly noteworthy, as it reduces complexity and enhances readability.
INFO - Updated entry: In this task, the goal was to determine if there are three adjacent sides of a cube painted the same color based on given inputs. The cube has six sides, and the adjacency of sides was defined by specific combinations. The solution involved checking these combinations for each test case.

The main function is `can_choose_three_adjacent_sides`.
INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] The function processes a specified number of test cases, each involving the colors of six sides of a cube. For each test case, it checks if there are three adjacent sides that share the same color by evaluating eight specific combinations of sides. If any of these combinations match, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO". The function reads input directly from the user for the colors of the sides. It effectively determines the possibility of selecting three adjacent sides of the same color for each test case. The results are printed immediately after evaluating each case.

[Problem]
    One day, Chef found a cube which has each of its sides painted in some color out of black, blue, red, green, yellow and orange.
    Now he asks you to check if he can choose three sides such that they are pairwise adjacent and painted in the same color.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
    - A single line of each test case contains six words denoting the colors of painted sides in the order: front, back, left, right, top and bottom, respectively.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, output a single line containing the word "YES" or "NO" (without quotes) corresponding to the answer of the problem.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤  50000 
    - Each color will be from the list {"black", "blue", "red", "green", "yellow", "orange"}

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask 1: (25 points)
    - 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤  12000 
    - For each test case there will be at most three different colors

    Subtask 2: (75 points)
    - Original constraints

    -----Example-----
    Input:
    2
    blue yellow green orange black green
    green yellow green orange black green

    Output:
    NO
    YES

    -----Explanation-----

    Example case 1.
    There are no three sides with the same color.

    Example case 2.
    In this test case, the front, bottom and left sides are green (see picture).
