The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the available days to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging simple loops and arithmetic.\n\n    The final implementation was clean and efficient, successfully passing all provided test cases. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all edge cases (like having fewer problems than needed for a single contest) are considered. The solution was implemented without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints given. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_contests(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    max_contests(T)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of clear problem understanding and systematic solution development.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money (K) to N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money, such that he ends up with exactly zero. The key insights were that if the total demand from all minions exceeds K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and if the total demand equals K, he can distribute the money exactly.\n\n    Initially, I implemented a solution that simply checked if the total demand was greater than, equal to, or less than K. However, this approach failed to account for the scenario where the total demand was less than K but could still be distributed in a way that Gru ends up with zero. The logic needed to ensure that Gru could fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.\n\n    The correct approach involves:\n    1. Calculating the total demand.\n    2. Checking if the total demand exceeds K (output \"NO\").\n    3. If the total demand equals K, output \"YES\".\n    4. If the total demand is less than K, output \"NO\" since Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.\n\n    The final code snippet that captures this logic is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T):\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, input().split())\n            A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n            total_demand = sum(A)\n        \n            if total_demand > K:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            elif total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    can_distribute_money(T)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the conditions under which money can be distributed and ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involves maximizing the sum of pizza slice sizes taken from a circular array, where the picking order is constrained by the actions of two friends. The key concepts tested here include dynamic programming and handling circular arrays, which require careful consideration of the start and end indices when making selections.\n\n    The solution was structured around a helper function that calculates the maximum sum of slices based on whether the first slice is included or excluded. This approach effectively breaks the problem into two scenarios, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of possible selections. The dynamic programming table was constructed to keep track of the maximum sums achievable with varying numbers of slices taken.\n\n    The final implementation successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was sound. The main takeaway is the importance of considering edge cases in circular arrays and the utility of dynamic programming in optimizing selection problems. The solution is efficient and adheres to the constraints given, making it a robust approach for similar problems in the future. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def maxSizeSlices(self, slices: list[int]) -> int:\n            n = len(slices)\n            k = n // 3  # number of slices you can take\n        \n            # Helper function to calculate max sum of slices\n            def calculateMaxSum(slices, start, end, k):\n                dp = [[0] * (end - start + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]\n                for i in range(start, end + 1):\n                    for j in range(min(i - start + 1, k), 0, -1):\n                        dp[j][i - start] = max(dp[j][i - start - 1], \n                                               dp[j - 1][i - start - 2] + slices[i])\n                return dp[k][end - start]\n\n            # Calculate max sum including first slice (excluding last slice)\n            max1 = calculateMaxSum(slices, 0, n - 2, k)\n            # Calculate max sum excluding first slice (including last slice)\n            max2 = calculateMaxSum(slices, 1, n - 1, k)\n\n            return max(max1, max2)\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"
