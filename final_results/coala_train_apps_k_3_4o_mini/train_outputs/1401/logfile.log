Anushka wants to buy chocolates.there are many chocolates in front of her, tagged with their prices.

Anushka has only a certain amount to spend, and she wants to maximize the number of chocolates she buys with this money.

Given a list of prices and an amount to spend, what is the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy? 

For example, 

if prices =[1,2,3,4]
and Anushka has k=7 to spend, she can buy items [1,2,3] for 6 , or [3,4] for 7 units of currency. she would choose the first group of 3 items.

Input Format

The first line contains two integers, n and k , the number of priced chocolates and the amount Anushka has to spend.

The next line contains n space-separated integers prices[i]

Constraints

INFO - [Task id] 1401 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Anushka wants to buy as many chocolates as possible without exceeding her budget. Each chocolate has a specific price, and we need to determine the maximum number of chocolates she can buy given a list of prices and a total amount of money she can spend.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - First, sort the list of chocolate prices in ascending order. This way, we can start buying the cheapest chocolates first, which will allow Anushka to maximize the number of chocolates she can buy.
   - Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of chocolates bought and a variable to keep track of the total money spent.
   - Iterate through the sorted list of prices, and for each price, check if adding that price to the total spent would exceed the budget. If it does not exceed the budget, add the price to the total spent and increment the counter. If it does exceed the budget, stop the process as we cannot afford any more chocolates.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_chocolates(n, k, prices):
       sort prices in ascending order
       initialize count = 0
       initialize total_spent = 0
       
       for price in prices:
           if total_spent + price <= k:
               total_spent += price
               count += 1
           else:
               break
       
       return count
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def max_chocolates(n, k, prices):
    # Step 1: Sort the prices in ascending order
    prices.sort()
    
    # Step 2: Initialize count of chocolates and total money spent
    count = 0
    total_spent = 0
    
    # Step 3: Iterate through the sorted prices
    for price in prices:
        # Step 4: Check if we can afford the current chocolate
        if total_spent + price <= k:
            total_spent += price  # Add the price to total spent
            count += 1            # Increment the count of chocolates bought
        else:
            break  # Stop if we can't afford the next chocolate
    
    # Step 5: Return the total count of chocolates bought
    return count

# Reading input

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the problems created by his setters, the number of problems needed for each contest, and the number of days available. The core concepts involved were basic arithmetic operations, specifically summing a list of integers and performing integer division.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, calculating the total number of problems, determining how many contests could be formed, and then comparing that with the available days to find the maximum contests Chef could host. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging simple loops and arithmetic.

    The final implementation was clean and efficient, successfully passing all provided test cases. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all edge cases (like having fewer problems than needed for a single contest) are considered. The solution was implemented without any external libraries, adhering to the constraints given. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def max_contests(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    max_contests(T)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of clear problem understanding and systematic solution development.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money (K) to N minions, each demanding a specific amount of money, such that he ends up with exactly zero. The key insights were that if the total demand from all minions exceeds K, Gru cannot fulfill the demands, and if the total demand equals K, he can distribute the money exactly.

    Initially, I implemented a solution that simply checked if the total demand was greater than, equal to, or less than K. However, this approach failed to account for the scenario where the total demand was less than K but could still be distributed in a way that Gru ends up with zero. The logic needed to ensure that Gru could fulfill each demand without running out of money at any point.

    The correct approach involves:
    1. Calculating the total demand.
    2. Checking if the total demand exceeds K (output "NO").
    3. If the total demand equals K, output "YES".
    4. If the total demand is less than K, output "NO" since Gru cannot distribute the money to reach exactly zero.

    The final code snippet that captures this logic is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, input().split())
            A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
            total_demand = sum(A)
        
            if total_demand > K:
                print("NO")
            elif total_demand == K:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    can_distribute_money(T)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the conditions under which money can be distributed and ensuring that all edge cases are handled correctly.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    The problem involves maximizing the sum of pizza slice sizes taken from a circular array, where the picking order is constrained by the actions of two friends. The key concepts tested here include dynamic programming and handling circular arrays, which require careful consideration of the start and end indices when making selections.

    The solution was structured around a helper function that calculates the maximum sum of slices based on whether the first slice is included or excluded. This approach effectively breaks the problem into two scenarios, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of possible selections. The dynamic programming table was constructed to keep track of the maximum sums achievable with varying numbers of slices taken.

    The final implementation successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was sound. The main takeaway is the importance of considering edge cases in circular arrays and the utility of dynamic programming in optimizing selection problems. The solution is efficient and adheres to the constraints given, making it a robust approach for similar problems in the future. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def maxSizeSlices(self, slices: list[int]) -> int:
            n = len(slices)
            k = n // 3  # number of slices you can take
        
            # Helper function to calculate max sum of slices
            def calculateMaxSum(slices, start, end, k):
                dp = [[0] * (end - start + 1) for _ in range(k + 1)]
                for i in range(start, end + 1):
                    for j in range(min(i - start + 1, k), 0, -1):
                        dp[j][i - start] = max(dp[j][i - start - 1], 
                                               dp[j - 1][i - start - 2] + slices[i])
                return dp[k][end - start]

            # Calculate max sum including first slice (excluding last slice)
            max1 = calculateMaxSum(slices, 0, n - 2, k)
            # Calculate max sum excluding first slice (including last slice)
            max2 = calculateMaxSum(slices, 1, n - 1, k)

Give me Chocolate

Anushka wants to buy chocolates.there are many chocolates in front of her, tagged with their prices.

Anushka has only a certain amount to spend, and she wants to maximize the number of chocolates she buys with this money.

Given a list of prices and an amount to spend, what is the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy? 

For example, 

if prices =[1,2,3,4]
and Anushka has k=7 to spend, she can buy items [1,2,3] for 6 , or [3,4] for 7 units of currency. she would choose the first group of 3 items.

Input Format

The first line contains two integers, n and k , the number of priced chocolates and the amount Anushka has to spend.

The next line contains n space-separated integers prices[i]

Constraints

1<= n <= 105

1<= k <= 109

1<= prices[i] <= 109



A chocolate can't be bought multiple times.

Output Format

An integer that denotes the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy for her.

Sample Input

INFO - [Task id] 1401 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   Anushka wants to buy as many chocolates as possible with a limited amount of money. Each chocolate has a specific price, and she needs to figure out how many chocolates she can buy without exceeding her budget.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - First, we will sort the list of chocolate prices in ascending order. This way, we can start buying the cheapest chocolates first, which will allow Anushka to maximize the number of chocolates she can buy.
   - Then, we will iterate through the sorted list of prices, keeping track of the total amount spent and the number of chocolates bought. We will stop when adding another chocolate would exceed her budget.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function max_chocolates(n, k, prices):
       sort prices in ascending order
       total_spent = 0
       chocolates_bought = 0
       
       for price in prices:
           if total_spent + price <= k:
               total_spent += price
               chocolates_bought += 1
           else:
               break
       
       return chocolates_bought

   read n and k
   read prices
   print max_chocolates(n, k, prices)

    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1401 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy given a list of prices and a budget. The core concept involved sorting the prices to prioritize purchasing the cheapest chocolates first, which is a common greedy algorithm strategy.

The solution was straightforward: after sorting the prices, I iterated through the list, maintaining a running total of the amount spent and counting the chocolates bought until the budget was exceeded. This approach effectively maximized the number of chocolates purchased.

The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test case without any issues. The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of sorting in optimization problems where resource allocation is constrained, as it allows for a more efficient selection process. The code snippet used is as follows:

```python
def max_chocolates(n, k, prices):
    prices.sort()
    total_spent = 0
    chocolates_bought = 0
    
    for price in prices:
        if total_spent + price <= k:
            total_spent += price
            chocolates_bought += 1
        else:
            break
    
    return chocolates_bought

n, k = map(int, input().split())
prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(max_chocolates(n, k, prices))
``` 

This solution effectively addresses the problem and can be referenced for similar future tasks involving budget constraints and optimization.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
n,k = map(int,input().split())
prices = list(map(int,input().split()))
prices.sort()
sum,cnt = 0, 0
for price in prices:
 sum += price
 if sum <= k: cnt += 1
 else: break
print(cnt)

INFO - [Task id] 1401 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem by following a straightforward approach: sorting the prices and then iterating through them while keeping track of the total spent and the count of chocolates bought. This method ensures that Anushka maximizes the number of chocolates she can buy within her budget.

Key insights from the official solution include:
1. **Sorting**: The prices are sorted in ascending order, which allows for purchasing the cheapest chocolates first, maximizing the quantity bought.
2. **Single Pass Calculation**: The solution uses a single loop to accumulate the total spent and count the chocolates, which is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.
3. **Early Exit**: The loop breaks as soon as the next chocolate cannot be afforded, which prevents unnecessary iterations.

My approach was similar, but I could have emphasized the early exit condition more clearly. The official solution's use of a single line to update both the total and count is also more concise. Overall, the official solution is efficient and clear, demonstrating a solid understanding of the problem requirements.
