    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to find out how many ways we can remove a contiguous subsequence from a given sequence of integers such that the remaining sequence is non-empty and strictly increasing. \n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the sequence and keep track of the longest strictly increasing subsequence that can be formed by removing different contiguous subsequences. For each possible starting and ending point of the subsequence we want to remove, we will check if the remaining elements form a strictly increasing sequence. We will count all valid ways to do this.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function countWays(T):\n       for each test case:\n           read N\n           read array A of size N\n           initialize count to 0\n           for start from 0 to N-1:\n               for end from start to N-1:\n                   create a new list B by removing A[start:end+1]\n                   if B is not empty and is strictly increasing:\n                       increment count\n           print count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef countWays(T):\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())  # Read the size of the array\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the array elements\n        count = 0  # Initialize the count of valid ways\n        \n        # Iterate over all possible starting points for the subsequence to remove\n        for start in range(N):\n            # Iterate over all possible ending points for the subsequence to remove\n            for end in range(start, N):\n                # Create a new list B by removing the subsequence A[start:end+1]\n                B = A[:start] + A[end+1:]\n                \n                # Check if B is non-empty and strictly increasing\n                if len(B) > 0 and all(B[i] < B[i + 1] for i in range(len(B) - 1)):\n                    count += 1  # Increment the count if B is valid\n        \n        print(count)  # Output the count for the current test case\n\nT = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases\ncountWays(T)  # Call the function to process the test cases\n```",
