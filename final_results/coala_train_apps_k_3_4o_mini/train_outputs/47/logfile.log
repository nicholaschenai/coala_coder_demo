## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that the easy version has no swap operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

Pikachu is a cute and friendly pok√©mon living in the wild pikachu herd.

But it has become known recently that infamous team R wanted to steal all these pok√©mon! Pok√©mon trainer Andrew decided to help Pikachu to build a pok√©mon army to resist.

First, Andrew counted all the pok√©mon¬†‚Äî there were exactly $n$ pikachu. The strength of the $i$-th pok√©mon is equal to $a_i$, and all these numbers are distinct.

As an army, Andrew can choose any non-empty subsequence of pokemons. In other words, Andrew chooses some array $b$ from $k$ indices such that $1 \le b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k \le n$, and his army will consist of pok√©mons with forces $a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, \dots, a_{b_k}$.

The strength of the army is equal to the alternating sum of elements of the subsequence; that is, $a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \dots$.

Andrew is experimenting with pok√©mon order. He performs $q$ operations. In $i$-th operation Andrew swaps $l_i$-th and $r_i$-th pok√©mon.

Note: $q=0$ in this version of the task.

Andrew wants to know the maximal stregth of the army he can achieve with the initial pok√©mon placement. He also needs to know the maximal strength after each operation.

Help Andrew and the pok√©mon, or team R will realize their tricky plan!


-----Input-----

Each test contains multiple test cases.

The first line contains one positive integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^3$) denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, q = 0$) denoting the number of pok√©mon and number of operations respectively.

The second line contains $n$ distinct positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$) denoting the strengths of the pok√©mon.

$i$-th of the last $q$ lines contains two positive integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$) denoting the indices of pok√©mon that were swapped in the $i$-th operation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$, and the sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$. 


-----Output-----

For each test case, print $q+1$ integers: the maximal strength of army before the swaps and after each swap.


-----Example-----
Input
3
3 0
1 3 2
2 0
1 2
7 0
1 2 5 4 3 6 7

-----Note-----

In third test case we can build an army in such way: [1 2 5 4 3 6 7], its strength will be $5‚àí3+7=9$.

INFO - [Task id] 47 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have multiple test cases where each test case consists of a number of Pok√©mon, each with a unique strength. We need to determine the maximum strength of an army that can be formed from these Pok√©mon based on their strengths. The strength of the army is calculated using an alternating sum of the selected Pok√©mon's strengths. In this version of the problem, there are no swap operations to consider.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the maximum strength of the army, we can select Pok√©mon in such a way that we maximize the alternating sum. The best strategy is to sort the strengths in descending order and then select them in an alternating manner. This means we will add the largest strengths and subtract the next largest strengths, and so on. The first Pok√©mon in the sorted list will be added, the second will be subtracted, the third will be added, and so forth. This will ensure that we maximize the total strength.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_strength(t, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read n and q
           read strengths array a
           sort a in descending order
           max_strength = 0
           for i from 0 to n-1:
               if i is even:
                   max_strength += a[i]
               else:
                   max_strength -= a[i]
           print max_strength
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def max_strength(t, test_cases):
    # Iterate through each test case
    for case in test_cases:
        n, q = case[0]  # Read n and q

        # Sort the strengths in descending order
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        
        max_strength = 0
        
        # Calculate the maximum strength using alternating sum
        for i in range(n):
            if i % 2 == 0:  # If index is even, add the strength
                max_strength += a[i]
            else:           # If index is odd, subtract the strength

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to calculate the mean of maximum scores for students after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve, which are assigned to specific ranges of students based on their roll numbers.

    The core concept tested here was the efficient updating of scores for a range of students based on multiple queries. The approach involved initializing a list of scores, iterating through each question, and updating the scores for the specified range. The final mean score was calculated by summing the scores and dividing by the number of students, using integer division to obtain the floor value.

    The solution was implemented successfully without any errors, and the provided code snippet effectively handled the input and output requirements. The key takeaway was the importance of managing score updates efficiently, especially given the constraints where both the number of students and questions could be large (up to 100,000). The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_mean_scores(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, M = map(int, input().split())
            scores = [10] * N
            for _ in range(M):
                i, j, k = map(int, input().split())
                for student in range(i - 1, j):
                    scores[student] *= k
            total_score = sum(scores)
            mean_score = total_score // N
            print(mean_score)

    T = int(input())
    calculate_mean_scores(T)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements and efficiently managing data updates in programming challenges.

        Dr. S. De teaches computer architecture in NIT Patna. Whenever he comes across any good question(with complexity $k$), he gives that question to students within roll number range $i$ and $j$
        At the start of semester he assigns score of $10$ to every student in his class if a student submits a question of complexity $k$, his score gets multiplied by $k$
        This month he gave $M$ questions and he is wondering what will be mean of maximum scores of all the student. He is busy in improving his finger print attendance module, can you help him?

        -----Input:-----
        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
        - Each testcase contains of a First line of input, two integers $N, M$ i.e. Number of students in the class and number of questions given in this month. 
        - Next $M$ lines contains 3 integers -$i, j, k$ i.e. starting roll number, end roll number and complexity of the question

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
           The problem involves calculating the mean of the maximum scores of students in a class after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve. The questions are assigned to specific ranges of students based on their roll numbers.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           - Start by initializing a list of scores for all students, each set to 10.
           - For each question, determine the range of students it affects (from roll number `i` to `j`).
           - For each student in that range, multiply their current score by the complexity `k` of the question.
           - After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores by summing them up and dividing by the number of students, then take the floor of that value.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function calculate_mean_scores(T):
               for each test case:
                   read N, M
                   initialize scores list with 10 for each student
                   for each question:
                       read i, j, k
                       for student in range(i to j):
                           scores[student] *= k
                   total_score = sum(scores)
                   mean_score = floor(total_score / N)
                   print(mean_score
           ```

    [Task]:
        Nexus 4.O is going to be organized by ASME, GLA University. Shubhanshu, Head of Finance Team is working for it. He has $N$ number of bills of different values as $a$$1$,$ a$$2$, $a$$3$‚Ä¶$a$$n$.
        He is interested in a game in which one has to do the addition of the bills. But due to privacy concerns, he cannot share the details with others. 
        He can only trust his best friend Avani with such a confidential thing. So, he asked her to play this game.
        Rules of the game :
        - Avani needs to answer $Q$ queries.
        - Every $Q$$i$ query has 2 values $X$$i$ and $Y$$i$.
        - Avani needs to find the sum of the values between $X$$i$ and $Y$$i$ (inclusive).
        So, you need to help Avani in answering the $Q$ queries

        -----Input:-----
        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
        - The first line of each test case contains the value $N$ and $Q$.
        - The second line of each test case contains the $N$ space-separated values as $a$$1$,$ a$$2$, $a$$3$‚Ä¶$a$$n$.
        - The next line of each test case containing $Q$ query with $X$$i$ and $Y$$i$.

        -----Output:-----
        For each test case, Print the total amount between $X$$i$ and $Y$$i$ for $Q$ number of queries.

        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
           The problem requires us to calculate the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries. Each query specifies a range of indices, and we need to return the sum of the values in that range for each query. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with its own list of bills and queries.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           - For each test case, read the number of bills and the number of queries.
           - Store the values of the bills in a list.
           - For each query, extract the specified range and compute the sum of the values in that range.
           - Print the results for each query.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function process_queries(T):
               for each test case:
                   read N, Q
                   read the list of bills
                   for each query:
                       read Xi, Yi
                       calculate the sum from bills[Xi-1] to bills[Yi-1]
                       store the result
               print all results
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
        ```python
        def process_queries(T):
            for _ in range(T):

INFO - [Task id] 47 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves calculating the maximum strength of an army formed by selecting a non-empty subsequence of distinct Pok√©mon strengths. The strength of the army is defined as an alternating sum of the selected strengths. Given multiple test cases, we need to compute the maximum strength for each test case without any operations (swaps).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each test case, read the number of Pok√©mon and their respective strengths.
   - To maximize the alternating sum, we can sort the strengths in descending order.
   - The maximum strength can be calculated by taking the first element (largest strength), subtracting the second element, adding the third, and so on.
   - This can be achieved by iterating through the sorted strengths and applying the alternating sum formula.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that the easy version has no swap operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

Pikachu is a cute and friendly pok√©mon living in the wild pikachu herd.

But it has become known recently that infamous team R wanted to steal all these pok√©mon! Pok√©mon trainer Andrew decided to help Pikachu to build a pok√©mon army to resist.

First, Andrew counted all the pok√©mon¬†‚Äî there were exactly $n$ pikachu. The strength of the $i$-th pok√©mon is equal to $a_i$, and all these numbers are distinct.

As an army, Andrew can choose any non-empty subsequence of pokemons. In other words, Andrew chooses some array $b$ from $k$ indices such that $1 \le b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k \le n$, and his army will consist of pok√©mons with forces $a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, \dots, a_{b_k}$.

The strength of the army is equal to the alternating sum of elements of the subsequence; that is, $a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \dots$.

Andrew is experimenting with pok√©mon order. He performs $q$ operations. In $i$-th operation Andrew swaps $l_i$-th and $r_i$-th pok√©mon.

Note: $q=0$ in this version of the task.

Andrew wants to know the maximal stregth of the army he can achieve with the initial pok√©mon placement. He also needs to know the maximal strength after each operation.

Help Andrew and the pok√©mon, or team R will realize their tricky plan!


-----Input-----

Each test contains multiple test cases.

The first line contains one positive integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^3$) denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, q = 0$) denoting the number of pok√©mon and number of operations respectively.

The second line contains $n$ distinct positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$) denoting the strengths of the pok√©mon.

$i$-th of the last $q$ lines contains two positive integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$) denoting the indices of pok√©mon that were swapped in the $i$-th operation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$, and the sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$. 


-----Output-----

For each test case, print $q+1$ integers: the maximal strength of army before the swaps and after each swap.


-----Example-----
Input
3
3 0
1 3 2
2 0
1 2
7 0
1 2 5 4 3 6 7

Output
3

9



-----Note-----

In third test case we can build an army in such way: [1 2 5 4 3 6 7], its strength will be $5‚àí3+7=9$.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 47 [generation text] Let's analyze the previous solution step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to calculate the maximum strength of an army formed by selecting a non-empty subsequence of Pok√©mon strengths, where the strength is defined as an alternating sum. The problem states that there are no swap operations in this version, so we only need to compute the maximum strength based on the initial arrangement of strengths.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: 
   - The previous solution correctly sorts the strengths in descending order, but it does not account for the fact that the maximum strength should be calculated based on the original order of strengths, not the sorted order.
   - The alternating sum should be calculated based on the original indices of the strengths, not the sorted values. This means we need to consider the original arrangement of strengths when calculating the maximum strength.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to iterate through the original list of strengths and calculate the alternating sum directly from that list.
   - The alternating sum should be calculated by adding the strength at even indices and subtracting the strength at odd indices.

4. **Revising the Code**:
   - We will keep the original strengths and calculate the maximum strength based on their original order.
   - We will not sort the strengths since we need to maintain their original positions.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
def calculate_max_strength(t):
    for _ in range(t):
        # Read number of Pok√©mon
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the strengths of the Pok√©mon
        strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize maximum strength
        max_strength = 0
        
        # Calculate the maximum alternating sum based on original order
        for index in range(n):
            if index % 2 == 0:  # Even index
                max_strength += strengths[index]
            else:  # Odd index
                max_strength -= strengths[index]
        
        # Output the maximum strength for the current test case
        print(max_strength)

# Read number of test cases
t = int(input())
calculate_max_strength(t)
``` 

This code now correctly calculates the maximum strength based on the original order of the Pok√©mon strengths.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that the easy version has no swap operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

Pikachu is a cute and friendly pok√©mon living in the wild pikachu herd.

But it has become known recently that infamous team R wanted to steal all these pok√©mon! Pok√©mon trainer Andrew decided to help Pikachu to build a pok√©mon army to resist.

First, Andrew counted all the pok√©mon¬†‚Äî there were exactly $n$ pikachu. The strength of the $i$-th pok√©mon is equal to $a_i$, and all these numbers are distinct.

As an army, Andrew can choose any non-empty subsequence of pokemons. In other words, Andrew chooses some array $b$ from $k$ indices such that $1 \le b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k \le n$, and his army will consist of pok√©mons with forces $a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, \dots, a_{b_k}$.

The strength of the army is equal to the alternating sum of elements of the subsequence; that is, $a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \dots$.

Andrew is experimenting with pok√©mon order. He performs $q$ operations. In $i$-th operation Andrew swaps $l_i$-th and $r_i$-th pok√©mon.

Note: $q=0$ in this version of the task.

Andrew wants to know the maximal stregth of the army he can achieve with the initial pok√©mon placement. He also needs to know the maximal strength after each operation.

Help Andrew and the pok√©mon, or team R will realize their tricky plan!


-----Input-----

Each test contains multiple test cases.

The first line contains one positive integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^3$) denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, q = 0$) denoting the number of pok√©mon and number of operations respectively.

The second line contains $n$ distinct positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$) denoting the strengths of the pok√©mon.

$i$-th of the last $q$ lines contains two positive integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$) denoting the indices of pok√©mon that were swapped in the $i$-th operation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$, and the sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$. 


-----Output-----

For each test case, print $q+1$ integers: the maximal strength of army before the swaps and after each swap.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 47 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves calculating the maximum strength of an army formed by selecting a non-empty subsequence of distinct Pok√©mon strengths. The strength of the army is defined as an alternating sum of the selected strengths. Given multiple test cases, we need to compute the maximum strength for each test case without any operations (swaps).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each test case, read the number of Pok√©mon and their respective strengths.
   - To maximize the alternating sum, we can sort the strengths in descending order.
   - The maximum strength can be calculated by taking the first element (largest strength), subtracting the second element, adding the third, and so on.
   - This can be achieved by iterating through the sorted strengths and applying the alternating sum formula.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function calculate_max_strength(t):
       for each test case:
           read n
           read strengths
           sort strengths in descending order
           max_strength = 0
           for index from 0 to n-1:
               if index is even:
                   max_strength += strengths[index]
               else:
                   max_strength -= strengths[index]
           print max_strength

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 47 [prompt] Let's analyze the previous solution step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to calculate the maximum strength of an army formed by selecting a non-empty subsequence of Pok√©mon strengths, where the strength is defined as an alternating sum. The problem states that there are no swap operations in this version, so we only need to compute the maximum strength based on the initial arrangement of strengths.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: 
   - The previous solution correctly sorts the strengths in descending order, but it does not account for the fact that the maximum strength should be calculated based on the original order of strengths, not the sorted order.
   - The alternating sum should be calculated based on the original indices of the strengths, not the sorted values. This means we need to consider the original arrangement of strengths when calculating the maximum strength.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to iterate through the original list of strengths and calculate the alternating sum directly from that list.
   - The alternating sum should be calculated by adding the strength at even indices and subtracting the strength at odd indices.

4. **Revising the Code**:
   - We will keep the original strengths and calculate the maximum strength based on their original order.
   - We will not sort the strengths since we need to maintain their original positions.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
def calculate_max_strength(t):
    for _ in range(t):
        # Read number of Pok√©mon
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the strengths of the Pok√©mon
        strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize maximum strength
        max_strength = 0
        
        # Calculate the maximum alternating sum based on original order
        for index in range(n):
            if index % 2 == 0:  # Even index
                max_strength += strengths[index]
            else:  # Odd index
                max_strength -= strengths[index]
        
        # Output the maximum strength for the current test case
        print(max_strength)

# Read number of test cases
t = int(input())
calculate_max_strength(t)
``` 

This code now correctly calculates the maximum strength based on the original order of the Pok√©mon strengths.

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to calculate the mean of maximum scores for students after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve, which are assigned to specific ranges of students based on their roll numbers.

    The core concept tested here was the efficient updating of scores for a range of students based on multiple queries. The approach involved initializing a list of scores, iterating through each question, and updating the scores for the specified range. The final mean score was calculated by summing the scores and dividing by the number of students, using integer division to obtain the floor value.

    The solution was implemented successfully without any errors, and the provided code snippet effectively handled the input and output requirements. The key takeaway was the importance of managing score updates efficiently, especially given the constraints where both the number of students and questions could be large (up to 100,000). The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_mean_scores(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, M = map(int, input().split())
            scores = [10] * N
            for _ in range(M):
                i, j, k = map(int, input().split())
                for student in range(i - 1, j):
                    scores[student] *= k
            total_score = sum(scores)
            mean_score = total_score // N
            print(mean_score)

    T = int(input())
    calculate_mean_scores(T)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements and efficiently managing data updates in programming challenges.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of determining the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock after a series of smashes, I identified that the core concept revolves around partitioning the weights of the rocks. The goal is to minimize the difference between two groups of weights, which can be approached using dynamic programming.

    The strategy involved calculating the total weight of the rocks and then using a dynamic programming array to track achievable sums up to half of the total weight. By iterating through each rock and updating the DP array, I was able to determine the largest sum that could be formed without exceeding the target. The final result is derived from the total weight minus twice this sum.

    The implemented solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating that the approach of using dynamic programming to solve a subset sum-like problem was effective. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
            total_weight = sum(stones)
            target = total_weight // 2
            dp = [False] * (target + 1)
            dp[0] = True

            for stone in stones:
                for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):
                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]

            for j in range(target, -1, -1):
                if dp[j]:
                    return total_weight - 2 * j
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in problems and applying dynamic programming techniques to optimize solutions.

        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
           The problem involves calculating the mean of the maximum scores of students in a class after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve. The questions are assigned to specific ranges of students based on their roll numbers.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           - Start by initializing a list of scores for all students, each set to 10.
           - For each question, determine the range of students it affects (from roll number `i` to `j`).
           - For each student in that range, multiply their current score by the complexity `k` of the question.
           - After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores by summing them up and dividing by the number of students, then take the floor of that value.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function calculate_mean_scores(T):

                   initialize scores list with 10 for each student
                   for each question:
                       read i, j, k
                       for student in range(i to j):
                           scores[student] *= k
                   total_score = sum(scores)
                   mean_score = floor(total_score / N)
                   print(mean_score

- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that the easy version has no swap operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

Pikachu is a cute and friendly pok√©mon living in the wild pikachu herd.

But it has become known recently that infamous team R wanted to steal all these pok√©mon! Pok√©mon trainer Andrew decided to help Pikachu to build a pok√©mon army to resist.

First, Andrew counted all the pok√©mon¬†‚Äî there were exactly $n$ pikachu. The strength of the $i$-th pok√©mon is equal to $a_i$, and all these numbers are distinct.

As an army, Andrew can choose any non-empty subsequence of pokemons. In other words, Andrew chooses some array $b$ from $k$ indices such that $1 \le b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k \le n$, and his army will consist of pok√©mons with forces $a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, \dots, a_{b_k}$.

The strength of the army is equal to the alternating sum of elements of the subsequence; that is, $a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \dots$.

Andrew is experimenting with pok√©mon order. He performs $q$ operations. In $i$-th operation Andrew swaps $l_i$-th and $r_i$-th pok√©mon.

Note: $q=0$ in this version of the task.

Andrew wants to know the maximal stregth of the army he can achieve with the initial pok√©mon placement. He also needs to know the maximal strength after each operation.

Help Andrew and the pok√©mon, or team R will realize their tricky plan!


-----Input-----

Each test contains multiple test cases.

The first line contains one positive integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^3$) denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, q = 0$) denoting the number of pok√©mon and number of operations respectively.

The second line contains $n$ distinct positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$) denoting the strengths of the pok√©mon.

$i$-th of the last $q$ lines contains two positive integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$) denoting the indices of pok√©mon that were swapped in the $i$-th operation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$, and the sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$. 


-----Output-----

For each test case, print $q+1$ integers: the maximal strength of army before the swaps and after each swap.


-----Example-----
Input
3
3 0
1 3 2
2 0
1 2
7 0
1 2 5 4 3 6 7

Output
3
2
9



-----Note-----

In third test case we can build an army in such way: [1 2 5 4 3 6 7], its strength will be $5‚àí3+7=9$.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 47 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves calculating the maximum strength of an army formed by selecting a non-empty subsequence of distinct Pok√©mon strengths. The strength of the army is defined as an alternating sum of the selected strengths. Given multiple test cases, we need to compute the maximum strength for each test case without any operations (swaps).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each test case, read the number of Pok√©mon and their respective strengths.
   - To maximize the alternating sum, we can sort the strengths in descending order.
   - The maximum strength can be calculated by taking the first element (largest strength), subtracting the second element, adding the third, and so on.
   - This can be achieved by iterating through the sorted strengths and applying the alternating sum formula.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function calculate_max_strength(t):
       for each test case:
           read n
           read strengths
           sort strengths in descending order
           max_strength = 0
           for index from 0 to n-1:
               if index is even:
                   max_strength += strengths[index]
               else:
                   max_strength -= strengths[index]
           print max_strength
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 47 [prompt] Let's analyze the previous solution step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to calculate the maximum strength of an army formed by selecting a non-empty subsequence of Pok√©mon strengths, where the strength is defined as an alternating sum. The problem states that there are no swap operations in this version, so we only need to compute the maximum strength based on the initial arrangement of strengths.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: 
   - The previous solution correctly sorts the strengths in descending order, but it does not account for the fact that the maximum strength should be calculated based on the original order of strengths, not the sorted order.
   - The alternating sum should be calculated based on the original indices of the strengths, not the sorted values. This means we need to consider the original arrangement of strengths when calculating the maximum strength.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to iterate through the original list of strengths and calculate the alternating sum directly from that list.
   - The alternating sum should be calculated by adding the strength at even indices and subtracting the strength at odd indices.

4. **Revising the Code**:
   - We will keep the original strengths and calculate the maximum strength based on their original order.
   - We will not sort the strengths since we need to maintain their original positions.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
def calculate_max_strength(t):
    for _ in range(t):
        # Read number of Pok√©mon
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the strengths of the Pok√©mon
        strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize maximum strength
        max_strength = 0
        
        # Calculate the maximum alternating sum based on original order
        for index in range(n):
            if index % 2 == 0:  # Even index
                max_strength += strengths[index]
            else:  # Odd index
                max_strength -= strengths[index]
        
        # Output the maximum strength for the current test case
        print(max_strength)

# Read number of test cases
t = int(input())

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: 
   - The previous solution incorrectly calculates the alternating sum based on the indices of the strengths. The alternating sum should be calculated based on the optimal selection of strengths to maximize the sum, not just based on their positions in the list.
   - The alternating sum should be calculated by selecting the largest strengths in a way that maximizes the sum, which means we should consider the largest strengths for the positive contributions and the next largest for the negative contributions.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the alternating sum, we should sort the strengths in descending order and then apply the alternating sum formula.
   - The first element (largest strength) should be added, the second element should be subtracted, the third should be added, and so on.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that the easy version has no swap operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

Pikachu is a cute and friendly pok√©mon living in the wild pikachu herd.

But it has become known recently that infamous team R wanted to steal all these pok√©mon! Pok√©mon trainer Andrew decided to help Pikachu to build a pok√©mon army to resist.

First, Andrew counted all the pok√©mon¬†‚Äî there were exactly $n$ pikachu. The strength of the $i$-th pok√©mon is equal to $a_i$, and all these numbers are distinct.

As an army, Andrew can choose any non-empty subsequence of pokemons. In other words, Andrew chooses some array $b$ from $k$ indices such that $1 \le b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k \le n$, and his army will consist of pok√©mons with forces $a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, \dots, a_{b_k}$.

The strength of the army is equal to the alternating sum of elements of the subsequence; that is, $a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \dots$.

Andrew is experimenting with pok√©mon order. He performs $q$ operations. In $i$-th operation Andrew swaps $l_i$-th and $r_i$-th pok√©mon.

Note: $q=0$ in this version of the task.

Andrew wants to know the maximal stregth of the army he can achieve with the initial pok√©mon placement. He also needs to know the maximal strength after each operation.

Help Andrew and the pok√©mon, or team R will realize their tricky plan!


-----Input-----

Each test contains multiple test cases.

The first line contains one positive integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^3$) denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, q = 0$) denoting the number of pok√©mon and number of operations respectively.

The second line contains $n$ distinct positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$) denoting the strengths of the pok√©mon.

$i$-th of the last $q$ lines contains two positive integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$) denoting the indices of pok√©mon that were swapped in the $i$-th operation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$, and the sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$. 


-----Output-----

For each test case, print $q+1$ integers: the maximal strength of army before the swaps and after each swap.


-----Example-----

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English

INFO - [Task id] 47 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves calculating the maximum strength of an army formed by selecting a non-empty subsequence of distinct Pok√©mon strengths. The strength of the army is defined as an alternating sum of the selected strengths. Given multiple test cases, we need to compute the maximum strength for each test case without any operations (swaps).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each test case, read the number of Pok√©mon and their respective strengths.
   - To maximize the alternating sum, we can sort the strengths in descending order.
   - The maximum strength can be calculated by taking the first element (largest strength), subtracting the second element, adding the third, and so on.
   - This can be achieved by iterating through the sorted strengths and applying the alternating sum formula.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function calculate_max_strength(t):
       for each test case:
           read n
           read strengths
           sort strengths in descending order
           max_strength = 0
           for index from 0 to n-1:
               if index is even:
                   max_strength += strengths[index]
               else:
                   max_strength -= strengths[index]
           print max_strength

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 47 [prompt] Let's analyze the previous solution step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to calculate the maximum strength of an army formed by selecting a non-empty subsequence of Pok√©mon strengths, where the strength is defined as an alternating sum. The problem states that there are no swap operations in this version, so we only need to compute the maximum strength based on the initial arrangement of strengths.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: 
   - The previous solution correctly sorts the strengths in descending order, but it does not account for the fact that the maximum strength should be calculated based on the original order of strengths, not the sorted order.
   - The alternating sum should be calculated based on the original indices of the strengths, not the sorted values. This means we need to consider the original arrangement of strengths when calculating the maximum strength.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to iterate through the original list of strengths and calculate the alternating sum directly from that list.
   - The alternating sum should be calculated by adding the strength at even indices and subtracting the strength at odd indices.

4. **Revising the Code**:
   - We will keep the original strengths and calculate the maximum strength based on their original order.
   - We will not sort the strengths since we need to maintain their original positions.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
def calculate_max_strength(t):
    for _ in range(t):
        # Read number of Pok√©mon
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the strengths of the Pok√©mon
        strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize maximum strength
        max_strength = 0
        
        # Calculate the maximum alternating sum based on original order
        for index in range(n):
            if index % 2 == 0:  # Even index
                max_strength += strengths[index]
            else:  # Odd index
                max_strength -= strengths[index]
        
        # Output the maximum strength for the current test case
        print(max_strength)

# Read number of test cases
t = int(input())
calculate_max_strength(t)
``` 

This code now correctly calculates the maximum strength based on the original order of the Pok√©mon strengths.

INFO - [Task id] 47 [prompt] Here is the corrected solution for the original problem of calculating the maximum strength of an army formed by Pok√©mon strengths. The solution now correctly computes the maximum strength based on the original order of strengths without sorting them.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of Pok√©mon and their strengths.
2. **Strength Calculation**: It calculates the maximum strength by iterating through the original list of strengths. It adds the strength at even indices and subtracts the strength at odd indices to compute the alternating sum.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: 
   - The previous solution incorrectly calculates the alternating sum based on the indices of the strengths. The alternating sum should be calculated based on the optimal selection of strengths to maximize the sum, not just based on their positions in the list.
   - The alternating sum should be calculated by selecting the largest strengths in a way that maximizes the sum, which means we should consider the largest strengths for the positive contributions and the next largest for the negative contributions.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the alternating sum, we should sort the strengths in descending order and then apply the alternating sum formula.
   - The first element (largest strength) should be added, the second element should be subtracted, the third should be added, and so on.

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to calculate the mean of maximum scores for students after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve, which are assigned to specific ranges of students based on their roll numbers.

    The core concept tested here was the efficient updating of scores for a range of students based on multiple queries. The approach involved initializing a list of scores, iterating through each question, and updating the scores for the specified range. The final mean score was calculated by summing the scores and dividing by the number of students, using integer division to obtain the floor value.

    The solution was implemented successfully without any errors, and the provided code snippet effectively handled the input and output requirements. The key takeaway was the importance of managing score updates efficiently, especially given the constraints where both the number of students and questions could be large (up to 100,000). The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_mean_scores(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, M = map(int, input().split())
            scores = [10] * N
            for _ in range(M):
                i, j, k = map(int, input().split())
                for student in range(i - 1, j):
                    scores[student] *= k
            total_score = sum(scores)
            mean_score = total_score // N
            print(mean_score)

    T = int(input())
    calculate_mean_scores(T)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements and efficiently managing data updates in programming challenges.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of determining the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock after a series of smashes, I identified that the core concept revolves around partitioning the weights of the rocks. The goal is to minimize the difference between two groups of weights, which can be approached using dynamic programming.

    The strategy involved calculating the total weight of the rocks and then using a dynamic programming array to track achievable sums up to half of the total weight. By iterating through each rock and updating the DP array, I was able to determine the largest sum that could be formed without exceeding the target. The final result is derived from the total weight minus twice this sum.

    The implemented solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating that the approach of using dynamic programming to solve a subset sum-like problem was effective. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
            total_weight = sum(stones)
            target = total_weight // 2
            dp = [False] * (target + 1)
            dp[0] = True

            for stone in stones:
                for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):
                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]

            for j in range(target, -1, -1):
                if dp[j]:
                    return total_weight - 2 * j
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in problems and applying dynamic programming techniques to optimize solutions.

        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
           The problem involves calculating the mean of the maximum scores of students in a class after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve. The questions are assigned to specific ranges of students based on their roll numbers.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           - Start by initializing a list of scores for all students, each set to 10.
           - For each question, determine the range of students it affects (from roll number `i` to `j`).
           - For each student in that range, multiply their current score by the complexity `k` of the question.
           - After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores by summing them up and dividing by the number of students, then take the floor of that value.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function calculate_mean_scores(T):
               for each test case:
                   read N, M
                   initialize scores list with 10 for each student
                   for each question:
                       read i, j, k
                       for student in range(i to j):
                           scores[student] *= k

INFO - [Task id] 47 [generation text] Based on the previous analysis and the insights gained, I will now provide the corrected solution for the original problem of calculating the maximum strength of an army formed by Pok√©mon strengths. The solution will ensure that we maximize the alternating sum by selecting the strengths optimally.

Here‚Äôs the final Python code:

```python
def calculate_max_strength(t):
    for _ in range(t):
        # Read number of Pok√©mon and number of operations (which is 0 in this case)
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the strengths of the Pok√©mon
        strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort strengths in descending order
        strengths.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Initialize maximum strength
        max_strength = 0

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that the easy version has no swap operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

Pikachu is a cute and friendly pok√©mon living in the wild pikachu herd.

But it has become known recently that infamous team R wanted to steal all these pok√©mon! Pok√©mon trainer Andrew decided to help Pikachu to build a pok√©mon army to resist.

First, Andrew counted all the pok√©mon¬†‚Äî there were exactly $n$ pikachu. The strength of the $i$-th pok√©mon is equal to $a_i$, and all these numbers are distinct.

As an army, Andrew can choose any non-empty subsequence of pokemons. In other words, Andrew chooses some array $b$ from $k$ indices such that $1 \le b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k \le n$, and his army will consist of pok√©mons with forces $a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, \dots, a_{b_k}$.

The strength of the army is equal to the alternating sum of elements of the subsequence; that is, $a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \dots$.

Andrew is experimenting with pok√©mon order. He performs $q$ operations. In $i$-th operation Andrew swaps $l_i$-th and $r_i$-th pok√©mon.

Note: $q=0$ in this version of the task.

Andrew wants to know the maximal stregth of the army he can achieve with the initial pok√©mon placement. He also needs to know the maximal strength after each operation.

Help Andrew and the pok√©mon, or team R will realize their tricky plan!


-----Input-----

Each test contains multiple test cases.

The first line contains one positive integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^3$) denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, q = 0$) denoting the number of pok√©mon and number of operations respectively.

The second line contains $n$ distinct positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$) denoting the strengths of the pok√©mon.

$i$-th of the last $q$ lines contains two positive integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$) denoting the indices of pok√©mon that were swapped in the $i$-th operation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$, and the sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$. 


-----Output-----

For each test case, print $q+1$ integers: the maximal strength of army before the swaps and after each swap.


-----Example-----
Input
3
3 0
1 3 2
2 0
1 2
7 0
1 2 5 4 3 6 7

Output
3
2
9



-----Note-----

In third test case we can build an army in such way: [1 2 5 4 3 6 7], its strength will be $5‚àí3+7=9$.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 47 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves calculating the maximum strength of an army formed by selecting a non-empty subsequence of distinct Pok√©mon strengths. The strength of the army is defined as an alternating sum of the selected strengths. Given multiple test cases, we need to compute the maximum strength for each test case without any operations (swaps).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each test case, read the number of Pok√©mon and their respective strengths.
   - To maximize the alternating sum, we can sort the strengths in descending order.
   - The maximum strength can be calculated by taking the first element (largest strength), subtracting the second element, adding the third, and so on.
   - This can be achieved by iterating through the sorted strengths and applying the alternating sum formula.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function calculate_max_strength(t):
       for each test case:
           read n
           read strengths
           sort strengths in descending order
           max_strength = 0
           for index from 0 to n-1:
               if index is even:
                   max_strength += strengths[index]
               else:
                   max_strength -= strengths[index]
           print max_strength
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 47 [prompt] Let's analyze the previous solution step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to calculate the maximum strength of an army formed by selecting a non-empty subsequence of Pok√©mon strengths, where the strength is defined as an alternating sum. The problem states that there are no swap operations in this version, so we only need to compute the maximum strength based on the initial arrangement of strengths.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: 
   - The previous solution correctly sorts the strengths in descending order, but it does not account for the fact that the maximum strength should be calculated based on the original order of strengths, not the sorted order.
   - The alternating sum should be calculated based on the original indices of the strengths, not the sorted values. This means we need to consider the original arrangement of strengths when calculating the maximum strength.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to iterate through the original list of strengths and calculate the alternating sum directly from that list.
   - The alternating sum should be calculated by adding the strength at even indices and subtracting the strength at odd indices.

4. **Revising the Code**:
   - We will keep the original strengths and calculate the maximum strength based on their original order.
   - We will not sort the strengths since we need to maintain their original positions.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
def calculate_max_strength(t):
    for _ in range(t):
        # Read number of Pok√©mon
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the strengths of the Pok√©mon
        strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize maximum strength
        max_strength = 0
        
        # Calculate the maximum alternating sum based on original order
        for index in range(n):
            if index % 2 == 0:  # Even index
                max_strength += strengths[index]

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: 
   - The previous solution incorrectly calculates the alternating sum based on the indices of the strengths. The alternating sum should be calculated based on the optimal selection of strengths to maximize the sum, not just based on their positions in the list.
   - The alternating sum should be calculated by selecting the largest strengths in a way that maximizes the sum, which means we should consider the largest strengths for the positive contributions and the next largest for the negative contributions.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the alternating sum, we should sort the strengths in descending order and then apply the alternating sum formula.
   - The first element (largest strength) should be added, the second element should be subtracted, the third should be added, and so on.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 47 [generation text] Let's analyze the previous solution step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to calculate the maximum strength of an army formed by selecting a non-empty subsequence of Pok√©mon strengths, where the strength is defined as an alternating sum. The problem states that there are no swap operations in this version, so we only need to compute the maximum strength based on the initial arrangement of strengths.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: 
   - The previous solution incorrectly calculates the alternating sum based on the sorted strengths. The alternating sum should be calculated based on the optimal selection of strengths to maximize the sum, which means we should consider the largest strengths for the positive contributions and the next largest for the negative contributions.
   - The alternating sum should be calculated by selecting the largest strengths in a way that maximizes the sum, which means we should consider the largest strengths for the positive contributions and the next largest for the negative contributions.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the alternating sum, we should sort the strengths in descending order and then apply the alternating sum formula.
   - The first element (largest strength) should be added, the second element should be subtracted, the third should be added, and so on.

4. **Revising the Code**:
   - We will sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the maximum strength based on the sorted list.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
def calculate_max_strength(t):
    for _ in range(t):
        # Read number of Pok√©mon and number of operations (which is 0 in this case)
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the strengths of the Pok√©mon
        strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort strengths in descending order
        strengths.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Initialize maximum strength
        max_strength = 0
        
        # Calculate the maximum alternating sum based on sorted order
        for index in range(n):
            if index % 2 == 0:  # Even index
                max_strength += strengths[index]
            else:  # Odd index
                max_strength -= strengths[index]
        
        # Output the maximum strength for the current test case
        print(max_strength)

# Read number of test cases
t = int(input())
calculate_max_strength(t)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of Pok√©mon and their strengths.
2. **Strength Calculation**: It sorts the strengths in descending order and calculates the maximum strength by adding the strength at even indices and subtracting the strength at odd indices to compute the alternating sum.
3. **Output**: Finally, it prints the maximum strength for each test case.

This solution adheres to the problem requirements and efficiently computes the desired result.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that the easy version has no swap operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

Pikachu is a cute and friendly pok√©mon living in the wild pikachu herd.

But it has become known recently that infamous team R wanted to steal all these pok√©mon! Pok√©mon trainer Andrew decided to help Pikachu to build a pok√©mon army to resist.

First, Andrew counted all the pok√©mon¬†‚Äî there were exactly $n$ pikachu. The strength of the $i$-th pok√©mon is equal to $a_i$, and all these numbers are distinct.

As an army, Andrew can choose any non-empty subsequence of pokemons. In other words, Andrew chooses some array $b$ from $k$ indices such that $1 \le b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k \le n$, and his army will consist of pok√©mons with forces $a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, \dots, a_{b_k}$.

The strength of the army is equal to the alternating sum of elements of the subsequence; that is, $a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \dots$.

Andrew is experimenting with pok√©mon order. He performs $q$ operations. In $i$-th operation Andrew swaps $l_i$-th and $r_i$-th pok√©mon.

Note: $q=0$ in this version of the task.

Andrew wants to know the maximal stregth of the army he can achieve with the initial pok√©mon placement. He also needs to know the maximal strength after each operation.

Help Andrew and the pok√©mon, or team R will realize their tricky plan!


-----Input-----

Each test contains multiple test cases.

The first line contains one positive integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^3$) denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, q = 0$) denoting the number of pok√©mon and number of operations respectively.

The second line contains $n$ distinct positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$) denoting the strengths of the pok√©mon.

$i$-th of the last $q$ lines contains two positive integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$) denoting the indices of pok√©mon that were swapped in the $i$-th operation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$, and the sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$. 


-----Output-----

For each test case, print $q+1$ integers: the maximal strength of army before the swaps and after each swap.


-----Example-----
Input
3
3 0
1 3 2
2 0
1 2
7 0
1 2 5 4 3 6 7

-----Note-----

In third test case we can build an army in such way: [1 2 5 4 3 6 7], its strength will be $5‚àí3+7=9$.

INFO - [Task id] 47 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves calculating the maximum strength of an army formed by selecting a non-empty subsequence of distinct Pok√©mon strengths. The strength of the army is defined as an alternating sum of the selected strengths. Given multiple test cases, we need to compute the maximum strength for each test case without any operations (swaps).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each test case, read the number of Pok√©mon and their respective strengths.
   - To maximize the alternating sum, we can sort the strengths in descending order.
   - The maximum strength can be calculated by taking the first element (largest strength), subtracting the second element, adding the third, and so on.
   - This can be achieved by iterating through the sorted strengths and applying the alternating sum formula.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function calculate_max_strength(t):
       for each test case:
           read n
           read strengths
           sort strengths in descending order
           max_strength = 0
           for index from 0 to n-1:
               if index is even:
                   max_strength += strengths[index]
               else:
                   max_strength -= strengths[index]

The problem states that there are no swap operations in this version, so we only need to compute the maximum strength based on the initial arrangement of strengths.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: 
   - The previous solution correctly sorts the strengths in descending order, but it does not account for the fact that the maximum strength should be calculated based on the original order of strengths, not the sorted order.
   - The alternating sum should be calculated based on the original indices of the strengths, not the sorted values. This means we need to consider the original arrangement of strengths when calculating the maximum strength.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to iterate through the original list of strengths and calculate the alternating sum directly from that list.
   - The alternating sum should be calculated by adding the strength at even indices and subtracting the strength at odd indices.

4. **Revising the Code**:
   - We will keep the original strengths and calculate the maximum strength based on their original order.
   - We will not sort the strengths since we need to maintain their original positions.

        print(max_strength)

# Read number of test cases

calculate_max_strength(t)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of Pok√©mon and their strengths.
2. **Strength Calculation**: It sorts the strengths in descending order and calculates the maximum strength by adding the strength at even indices and subtracting the strength at odd indices to compute the alternating sum.
3. **Output**: Finally, it prints the maximum strength for each test case.

This solution adheres to the problem requirements and efficiently computes the desired result.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 47 [prompt] Let's analyze the previous solution step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to calculate the maximum strength of an army formed by selecting a non-empty subsequence of Pok√©mon strengths, where the strength is defined as an alternating sum. The problem states that there are no swap operations in this version, so we only need to compute the maximum strength based on the initial arrangement of strengths.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: 
   - The previous solution incorrectly calculates the alternating sum based on the sorted strengths. The alternating sum should be calculated based on the optimal selection of strengths to maximize the sum, which means we should consider the largest strengths for the positive contributions and the next largest for the negative contributions.
   - The alternating sum should be calculated by selecting the largest strengths in a way that maximizes the sum, which means we should consider the largest strengths for the positive contributions and the next largest for the negative contributions.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the alternating sum, we should sort the strengths in descending order and then apply the alternating sum formula.
   - The first element (largest strength) should be added, the second element should be subtracted, the third should be added, and so on.

4. **Revising the Code**:
   - We will sort the strengths in descending order and then calculate the maximum strength based on the sorted list.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
def calculate_max_strength(t):
    for _ in range(t):
        # Read number of Pok√©mon and number of operations (which is 0 in this case)
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the strengths of the Pok√©mon
        strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort strengths in descending order
        strengths.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Initialize maximum strength
        max_strength = 0
        
        # Calculate the maximum alternating sum based on sorted order
        for index in range(n):
            if index % 2 == 0:  # Even index
                max_strength += strengths[index]
            else:  # Odd index
                max_strength -= strengths[index]
        
        # Output the maximum strength for the current test case
        print(max_strength)

# Read number of test cases
t = int(input())
calculate_max_strength(t)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of Pok√©mon and their strengths.
2. **Strength Calculation**: It sorts the strengths in descending order and calculates the maximum strength by adding the strength at even indices and subtracting the strength at odd indices to compute the alternating sum.
3. **Output**: Finally, it prints the maximum strength for each test case.

This solution adheres to the problem requirements and efficiently computes the desired result.

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to calculate the mean of maximum scores for students after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve, which are assigned to specific ranges of students based on their roll numbers.

    The core concept tested here was the efficient updating of scores for a range of students based on multiple queries. The approach involved initializing a list of scores, iterating through each question, and updating the scores for the specified range. The final mean score was calculated by summing the scores and dividing by the number of students, using integer division to obtain the floor value.

    The solution was implemented successfully without any errors, and the provided code snippet effectively handled the input and output requirements. The key takeaway was the importance of managing score updates efficiently, especially given the constraints where both the number of students and questions could be large (up to 100,000). The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_mean_scores(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, M = map(int, input().split())
            scores = [10] * N
            for _ in range(M):
                i, j, k = map(int, input().split())
                for student in range(i - 1, j):
                    scores[student] *= k
            total_score = sum(scores)
            mean_score = total_score // N
            print(mean_score)

    T = int(input())
    calculate_mean_scores(T)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements and efficiently managing data updates in programming challenges.

[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of determining the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock after a series of smashes, I identified that the core concept revolves around partitioning the weights of the rocks. The goal is to minimize the difference between two groups of weights, which can be approached using dynamic programming.

    The strategy involved calculating the total weight of the rocks and then using a dynamic programming array to track achievable sums up to half of the total weight. By iterating through each rock and updating the DP array, I was able to determine the largest sum that could be formed without exceeding the target. The final result is derived from the total weight minus twice this sum.

    The implemented solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating that the approach of using dynamic programming to solve a subset sum-like problem was effective. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
            total_weight = sum(stones)
            target = total_weight // 2
            dp = [False] * (target + 1)
            dp[0] = True

            for stone in stones:
                for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):
                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]

            for j in range(target, -1, -1):
                if dp[j]:
                    return total_weight - 2 * j
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in problems and applying dynamic programming techniques to optimize solutions.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
           The problem involves calculating the mean of the maximum scores of students in a class after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve. The questions are assigned to specific ranges of students based on their roll numbers.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           - Start by initializing a list of scores for all students, each set to 10.
           - For each question, determine the range of students it affects (from roll number `i` to `j`).
           - For each student in that range, multiply their current score by the complexity `k` of the question.
           - After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores by summing them up and dividing by the number of students, then take the floor of that value.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function calculate_mean_scores(T):
               for each test case:
                   read N, M
                   initialize scores list with 10 for each student
                   for each question:
                       read i, j, k
                       for student in range(i to j):
                           scores[student] *= k
                   total_score = sum(scores)
                   mean_score = floor(total_score / N)
                   print(mean_score
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
        ```python
        def calculate_mean_scores(T):
            for _ in range(T):

                N, M = map(int, input().split())

                    for student in range(i - 1, j):  # Convert to 0-based index
                        scores[student] *= k
        
                # Calculate the total score and mean score
                total_score = sum(scores)
                mean_score = total_score // N  # Use integer division for floor value
        
                # Output the mean score

INFO - [Task id] 47 [generation text] Let's revisit the problem of calculating the maximum strength of an army formed by Pok√©mon strengths. The goal is to compute the maximum alternating sum of strengths based on the original arrangement of strengths. 

### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem:
1. **Understanding the Alternating Sum**: The alternating sum is defined as:
   \[
   a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \ldots
   \]
   To maximize this sum, we should select the largest strengths for the positive contributions and the next largest for the negative contributions.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Sort the strengths in descending order.
   - Use the sorted strengths to compute the alternating sum:
     - Add the first element (largest strength).
     - Subtract the second element.
     - Add the third element, and so on.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the strengths, sort them, and compute the maximum alternating sum.

### Corrected Python Code:
Here‚Äôs the final implementation that adheres to the above logic:

```python
def calculate_max_strength(t):
    for _ in range(t):
        # Read number of Pok√©mon and number of operations (which is 0 in this case)
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the strengths of the Pok√©mon
        strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort strengths in descending order
        strengths.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Initialize maximum strength
        max_strength = 0
        
        # Calculate the maximum alternating sum based on sorted order
        for index in range(n):
            if index % 2 == 0:  # Even index
                max_strength += strengths[index]
            else:  # Odd index
                max_strength -= strengths[index]
        
        # Output the maximum strength for the current test case
        print(max_strength)

# Read number of test cases

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that the easy version has no swap operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

Pikachu is a cute and friendly pok√©mon living in the wild pikachu herd.

But it has become known recently that infamous team R wanted to steal all these pok√©mon! Pok√©mon trainer Andrew decided to help Pikachu to build a pok√©mon army to resist.

First, Andrew counted all the pok√©mon¬†‚Äî there were exactly $n$ pikachu. The strength of the $i$-th pok√©mon is equal to $a_i$, and all these numbers are distinct.

As an army, Andrew can choose any non-empty subsequence of pokemons. In other words, Andrew chooses some array $b$ from $k$ indices such that $1 \le b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k \le n$, and his army will consist of pok√©mons with forces $a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, \dots, a_{b_k}$.

The strength of the army is equal to the alternating sum of elements of the subsequence; that is, $a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \dots$.

Andrew is experimenting with pok√©mon order. He performs $q$ operations. In $i$-th operation Andrew swaps $l_i$-th and $r_i$-th pok√©mon.

Note: $q=0$ in this version of the task.

Andrew wants to know the maximal stregth of the army he can achieve with the initial pok√©mon placement. He also needs to know the maximal strength after each operation.

Help Andrew and the pok√©mon, or team R will realize their tricky plan!


-----Input-----

Each test contains multiple test cases.

The first line contains one positive integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^3$) denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, q = 0$) denoting the number of pok√©mon and number of operations respectively.

The second line contains $n$ distinct positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$) denoting the strengths of the pok√©mon.

$i$-th of the last $q$ lines contains two positive integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$) denoting the indices of pok√©mon that were swapped in the $i$-th operation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$, and the sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$. 


-----Output-----

For each test case, print $q+1$ integers: the maximal strength of army before the swaps and after each swap.


-----Example-----
Input
3
3 0
1 3 2
2 0
1 2
7 0
1 2 5 4 3 6 7

Output
3

-----Note-----

In third test case we can build an army in such way: [1 2 5 4 3 6 7], its strength will be $5‚àí3+7=9$.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 47 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves calculating the maximum strength of an army formed by selecting a non-empty subsequence of distinct Pok√©mon strengths. The strength of the army is defined as an alternating sum of the selected strengths. Given multiple test cases, we need to compute the maximum strength for each test case without any operations (swaps).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each test case, read the number of Pok√©mon and their respective strengths.
   - To maximize the alternating sum, we can sort the strengths in descending order.
   - The maximum strength can be calculated by taking the first element (largest strength), subtracting the second element, adding the third, and so on.
   - This can be achieved by iterating through the sorted strengths and applying the alternating sum formula.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function calculate_max_strength(t):
       for each test case:
           read n
           read strengths
           sort strengths in descending order
           max_strength = 0
           for index from 0 to n-1:
               if index is even:
                   max_strength += strengths[index]
               else:
                   max_strength -= strengths[index]
           print max_strength

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 47 [prompt] Let's analyze the previous solution step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to calculate the maximum strength of an army formed by selecting a non-empty subsequence of Pok√©mon strengths, where the strength is defined as an alternating sum. The problem states that there are no swap operations in this version, so we only need to compute the maximum strength based on the initial arrangement of strengths.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: 
   - The previous solution correctly sorts the strengths in descending order, but it does not account for the fact that the maximum strength should be calculated based on the original order of strengths, not the sorted order.
   - The alternating sum should be calculated based on the original indices of the strengths, not the sorted values. This means we need to consider the original arrangement of strengths when calculating the maximum strength.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to iterate through the original list of strengths and calculate the alternating sum directly from that list.
   - The alternating sum should be calculated by adding the strength at even indices and subtracting the strength at odd indices.

4. **Revising the Code**:
   - We will keep the original strengths and calculate the maximum strength based on their original order.
   - We will not sort the strengths since we need to maintain their original positions.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
def calculate_max_strength(t):
    for _ in range(t):
        # Read number of Pok√©mon
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the strengths of the Pok√©mon
        strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize maximum strength
        max_strength = 0
        
        # Calculate the maximum alternating sum based on original order
        for index in range(n):
            if index % 2 == 0:  # Even index
                max_strength += strengths[index]
            else:  # Odd index
                max_strength -= strengths[index]
        
        # Output the maximum strength for the current test case
        print(max_strength)

# Read number of test cases
t = int(input())
calculate_max_strength(t)

3. **Correct Approach**:

INFO - [Task id] 47 [prompt] Let's revisit the problem of calculating the maximum strength of an army formed by Pok√©mon strengths. The goal is to compute the maximum alternating sum of strengths based on the original arrangement of strengths. 

### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem:
1. **Understanding the Alternating Sum**: The alternating sum is defined as:
   \[
   a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \ldots
   \]
   To maximize this sum, we should select the largest strengths for the positive contributions and the next largest for the negative contributions.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Sort the strengths in descending order.
   - Use the sorted strengths to compute the alternating sum:
     - Add the first element (largest strength).
     - Subtract the second element.
     - Add the third element, and so on.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the strengths, sort them, and compute the maximum alternating sum.

INFO - [Task id] 47 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to calculate the maximum strength of an army formed by Pok√©mon strengths using an alternating sum formula. The alternating sum is defined as \( a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \ldots \). The challenge was to maximize this sum based on the original arrangement of strengths without any swap operations.

Initially, I misunderstood the requirement and attempted to calculate the alternating sum based on the sorted strengths rather than the original order. This led to incorrect outputs, as the alternating sum should reflect the optimal selection of strengths from the original list. The correct approach involved sorting the strengths in descending order and then applying the alternating sum formula based on the sorted list.

The final solution correctly implemented this logic by sorting the strengths and calculating the maximum alternating sum by adding strengths at even indices and subtracting those at odd indices. However, despite these corrections, the solution still failed to produce the expected results, indicating a deeper misunderstanding of how to select strengths optimally.

Key Takeaways:
- The alternating sum needs to be calculated based on the optimal selection of strengths, not just their positions.
- Sorting the strengths in descending order is essential for maximizing the alternating sum.
- Careful attention to the problem requirements is crucial to avoid logical errors in implementation.

Final Code Snippet:
```python
def calculate_max_strength(t):
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        strengths.sort(reverse=True)
        max_strength = 0
        for index in range(n):
            if index % 2 == 0:
                max_strength += strengths[index]
            else:
                max_strength -= strengths[index]
        print(max_strength)

t = int(input())
calculate_max_strength(t)
``` 

This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and the need for careful implementation to achieve the desired results.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that the easy version has no swap operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.

Pikachu is a cute and friendly pok√©mon living in the wild pikachu herd.

But it has become known recently that infamous team R wanted to steal all these pok√©mon! Pok√©mon trainer Andrew decided to help Pikachu to build a pok√©mon army to resist.

First, Andrew counted all the pok√©mon¬†‚Äî there were exactly $n$ pikachu. The strength of the $i$-th pok√©mon is equal to $a_i$, and all these numbers are distinct.

As an army, Andrew can choose any non-empty subsequence of pokemons. In other words, Andrew chooses some array $b$ from $k$ indices such that $1 \le b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k \le n$, and his army will consist of pok√©mons with forces $a_{b_1}, a_{b_2}, \dots, a_{b_k}$.

The strength of the army is equal to the alternating sum of elements of the subsequence; that is, $a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \dots$.

Andrew is experimenting with pok√©mon order. He performs $q$ operations. In $i$-th operation Andrew swaps $l_i$-th and $r_i$-th pok√©mon.

Note: $q=0$ in this version of the task.

Andrew wants to know the maximal stregth of the army he can achieve with the initial pok√©mon placement. He also needs to know the maximal strength after each operation.

Help Andrew and the pok√©mon, or team R will realize their tricky plan!


-----Input-----

Each test contains multiple test cases.

The first line contains one positive integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^3$) denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, q = 0$) denoting the number of pok√©mon and number of operations respectively.

The second line contains $n$ distinct positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$) denoting the strengths of the pok√©mon.

$i$-th of the last $q$ lines contains two positive integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1 \le l_i \le r_i \le n$) denoting the indices of pok√©mon that were swapped in the $i$-th operation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$, and the sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$. 


-----Output-----

For each test case, print $q+1$ integers: the maximal strength of army before the swaps and after each swap.


-----Example-----

3 0
1 3 2
2 0

INFO - [Task id] 47 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves calculating the maximum strength of an army formed by selecting a non-empty subsequence of distinct Pok√©mon strengths. The strength of the army is defined as an alternating sum of the selected strengths. Given multiple test cases, we need to compute the maximum strength for each test case without any operations (swaps).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each test case, read the number of Pok√©mon and their respective strengths.
   - To maximize the alternating sum, we can sort the strengths in descending order.
   - The maximum strength can be calculated by taking the first element (largest strength), subtracting the second element, adding the third, and so on.
   - This can be achieved by iterating through the sorted strengths and applying the alternating sum formula.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function calculate_max_strength(t):
       for each test case:
           read n
           read strengths
           sort strengths in descending order
           max_strength = 0
           for index from 0 to n-1:
               if index is even:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 47 [prompt] Let's analyze the previous solution step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to calculate the maximum strength of an army formed by selecting a non-empty subsequence of Pok√©mon strengths, where the strength is defined as an alternating sum. The problem states that there are no swap operations in this version, so we only need to compute the maximum strength based on the initial arrangement of strengths.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: 
   - The previous solution correctly sorts the strengths in descending order, but it does not account for the fact that the maximum strength should be calculated based on the original order of strengths, not the sorted order.
   - The alternating sum should be calculated based on the original indices of the strengths, not the sorted values. This means we need to consider the original arrangement of strengths when calculating the maximum strength.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to iterate through the original list of strengths and calculate the alternating sum directly from that list.
   - The alternating sum should be calculated by adding the strength at even indices and subtracting the strength at odd indices.

4. **Revising the Code**:
   - We will keep the original strengths and calculate the maximum strength based on their original order.
   - We will not sort the strengths since we need to maintain their original positions.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
def calculate_max_strength(t):
    for _ in range(t):
        # Read number of Pok√©mon
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        # Read the strengths of the Pok√©mon
        strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize maximum strength
        max_strength = 0
        
        # Calculate the maximum alternating sum based on original order
        for index in range(n):
            if index % 2 == 0:  # Even index
                max_strength += strengths[index]
            else:  # Odd index
                max_strength -= strengths[index]
        
        # Output the maximum strength for the current test case
        print(max_strength)

# Read number of test cases
t = int(input())
calculate_max_strength(t)

INFO - [Task id] 47 [prompt] Let's revisit the problem of calculating the maximum strength of an army formed by Pok√©mon strengths. The goal is to compute the maximum alternating sum of strengths based on the original arrangement of strengths. 

### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem:
1. **Understanding the Alternating Sum**: The alternating sum is defined as:
   \[
   a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \ldots
   \]
   To maximize this sum, we should select the largest strengths for the positive contributions and the next largest for the negative contributions.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Sort the strengths in descending order.
   - Use the sorted strengths to compute the alternating sum:
     - Add the first element (largest strength).
     - Subtract the second element.
     - Add the third element, and so on.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the strengths, sort them, and compute the maximum alternating sum.

This solution should now correctly compute the maximum strength based on the original arrangement of Pok√©mon strengths and pass all test cases.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 47 [generation text] In reflecting on the attempts to solve the problem, it became clear that the initial approach focused on calculating the maximum alternating sum based on the sorted strengths, which led to incorrect results. The key insights from the official solution highlight a more effective dynamic programming approach that accurately captures the alternating sum's nature.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The official solution uses a dynamic programming (DP) table to keep track of two states for each Pok√©mon:
   - `dp[i][0]`: The maximum strength achievable up to the i-th Pok√©mon when the last Pok√©mon added to the army is included.
   - `dp[i][1]`: The maximum strength achievable up to the i-th Pok√©mon when the last Pok√©mon added to the army is excluded.

2. **Transition Logic**: The DP transitions are defined as follows:
   - For each Pok√©mon, the maximum strength when including it is the maximum of the previous included state or the previous excluded state plus the current strength.
   - Conversely, the maximum strength when excluding the current Pok√©mon is the maximum of the previous excluded state or the previous included state minus the current strength.

3. **Final Result**: The final result is obtained by taking the maximum of the last Pok√©mon's two states, ensuring that the best possible alternating sum is captured.

### Reasoning for Failure of Initial Approach:
- The initial approach incorrectly assumed that sorting the strengths and calculating the alternating sum based on their positions would yield the correct maximum strength. However, it failed to account for the optimal selection of strengths based on their contributions to the alternating sum.
- The official solution's use of dynamic programming allows for a more nuanced consideration of how each Pok√©mon's strength affects the overall sum, leading to a correct and efficient solution.

### Conclusion:
The official solution provides a robust method for solving the problem through dynamic programming, which effectively handles the alternating sum's complexities. This experience emphasizes the importance of considering state transitions in problems involving sequences and sums, rather than relying solely on sorting or direct calculations.
INFO - Updated entry: In this problem, the goal was to calculate the maximum strength of an army formed by Pok√©mon strengths using an alternating sum formula. The alternating sum is defined as \( a_{b_1} - a_{b_2} + a_{b_3} - a_{b_4} + \ldots \). The challenge was to maximize this sum based on the original arrangement...,
