    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to determine how many different paths Ryan can take through a network of cities over a specified number of seconds, while also satisfying certain conditions about which city he must be in at specific times. Each city is connected by roads, and Ryan can either move to an adjacent city or stay in his current city at each second.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways Ryan can be in each city at each second. We will create a 2D array where the rows represent the time (from 0 to K) and the columns represent the cities (from 1 to N). We will initialize the starting position (city 1 at time 0) and then iteratively calculate the number of ways to reach each city at each subsequent second based on the roads connecting the cities. After populating this array, we will check the conditions provided and sum the valid paths that meet those conditions.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_trips(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):\n       MOD = 10**9 + 7\n       create adjacency list for cities\n       initialize dp array of size (K+1) x (N+1) with 0\n       dp[0][1] = 1  # Starting at city 1 at time 0\n\n       for time from 0 to K-1:\n           for each city from 1 to N:\n               for each neighbor in adjacency list[city]:\n                   dp[time + 1][neighbor] += dp[time][city]\n                   dp[time + 1][neighbor] %= MOD\n               dp[time + 1][city] += dp[time][city]  # Stay in the same city\n               dp[time + 1][city] %= MOD\n\n       result = 1\n       for each (a_i, b_i) in conditions:\n           result *= dp[b_i][a_i]\n           result %= MOD\n\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef count_trips(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    \n    # Create adjacency list for the cities\n    adjacency_list = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]\n    for u, v in roads:\n        adjacency_list[u].append(v)\n        adjacency_list[v].append(u)\n\n    # Initialize dp array\n    dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]\n    dp[0][1] = 1  # Starting at city 1 at time 0\n\n    # Fill the dp array\n    for time in range(K):\n        for city in range(1, N + 1):\n            for neighbor in adjacency_list[city]:\n                dp[time + 1][neighbor] += dp[time][city]\n                dp[time + 1][neighbor] %= MOD\n            dp[time + 1][city] += dp[time][city]  # Stay in the same city\n            dp[time + 1][city] %= MOD\n\n    # Calculate the result based on conditions\n    result = 1\n    for a_i, b_i in conditions:\n        result *= dp[b_i][a_i]\n        result %= MOD\n\n    return result\n\n# Read number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N, M, K = map(int, input().split())\n    roads = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(M)]\n    Q = int(input())\n    conditions = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(Q)]\n    print(count_trips(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions))\n```",
