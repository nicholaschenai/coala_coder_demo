    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We are given multiple queries, each containing a tree structure defined by its vertices and edges. Our task is to find the largest connected subtree (good subtree) within each tree that can be represented as a graph of segments that intersect. The output for each query should be the size of this maximum good subtree.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can utilize the properties of trees. A tree with `n` vertices has `n-1` edges, and any subtree of a tree is also a tree. The maximum size of a good subtree can be determined by the number of vertices minus the number of leaves in the tree. This is because the leaves do not contribute to the intersection of segments. Thus, the size of the maximum good subtree can be calculated as `n - number_of_leaves`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function max_good_subtree(q, queries):\n       for each query in queries:\n           read n (number of vertices)\n           initialize a list to count degrees of each vertex\n           for each edge (x, y):\n               increment the degree of x\n               increment the degree of y\n           count leaves (vertices with degree 1)\n           max_good_size = n - count_leaves\n           print max_good_size\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef max_good_subtree(q, queries):\n    results = []  # Initialize a list to store results for each query\n    for query in queries:\n        n = query[0]  # Number of vertices in the tree\n        degree = [0] * (n + 1)  # Degree array to count connections for each vertex\n        \n        # Read edges and calculate degrees\n        for edge in query[1]:\n            x, y = edge\n            degree[x] += 1\n            degree[y] += 1\n        \n        # Count the number of leaves (vertices with degree 1)\n        count_leaves = sum(1 for d in degree if d == 1)\n        \n        # The maximum size of a good subtree is n - count_leaves\n        max_good_size = n - count_leaves\n        results.append(max_good_size)  # Store the result for this query\n    \n    # Print all results for each query\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Read number of queries\nq = int(input())\nqueries = []\n\nfor _ in range(q):\n    n = int(input())  # Number of vertices in the tree\n    edges = []\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        x, y = map(int, input().split())\n        edges.append((x, y))  # Store the edges\n    queries.append((n, edges))  # Append the query with number of vertices and edges\n\nmax_good_subtree(q, queries)  # Call the function with the number of queries and the list of queries\n```",
