    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to reduce a given integer `n` to zero using two specific operations. The first operation allows us to flip the rightmost bit of `n` from 1 to 0. The second operation allows us to flip a bit at position `i` to 1 if the bit at position `i-1` is 1 and all bits below it (from `i-2` to `0`) are 0. Our goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. We will keep track of the number of operations needed to reduce `n` to zero. If `n` is zero, we return zero operations. If `n` is odd, we can perform the first operation to reduce it, and if `n` is even, we can perform the second operation. We will also need to consider the binary representation of `n` to determine which bits can be flipped based on the rules provided.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function minimumOneBitOperations(n):\n       if n is 0:\n           return 0\n       if n is odd:\n           return 1 + minimumOneBitOperations(n - 1)\n       else:\n           return 1 + minimumOneBitOperations(n // 2)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:\n        # Base case: if n is 0, no operations are needed\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        \n        # If n is odd, we can reduce it by flipping the rightmost bit\n        if n % 2 == 1:\n            return 1 + self.minimumOneBitOperations(n - 1)\n        else:\n            # If n is even, we can reduce it by flipping the highest bit\n            return 1 + self.minimumOneBitOperations(n // 2)\n```",
