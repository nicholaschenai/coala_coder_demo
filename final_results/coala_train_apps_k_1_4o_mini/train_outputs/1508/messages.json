The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is \\(N \\times (N - 1) / 2\\).\n\n    #### Key Concepts:\n    1. **Maximum and Minimum Values of f(P):** The maximum value occurs with a descending permutation, while the minimum is 0 (for N = 1).\n    2. **Adjustment of Permutation:** The challenge was to adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K by swapping elements to reduce the contribution of adjacent maximums.\n\n    #### Strategies and Issues:\n    - The initial approach involved starting with a descending permutation and attempting to reduce f(P) by swapping adjacent elements. However, this logic was flawed as it did not effectively account for how adjacent maximums changed with swaps.\n    - The code consistently returned `-1` for valid cases, indicating a failure to construct the desired permutation.\n\n    #### Lessons Learned:\n    - A more systematic approach is needed to generate permutations that can achieve specific values of K. The adjustment logic must be refined to ensure that all possible values of f(P) can be reached.\n    - Future implementations should focus on a clearer strategy for adjusting the permutation based on the difference between the current f(P) and the target K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n    The following code snippet represents the last attempt, which ultimately failed to pass the test cases:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n        results = []  # To store results for each test case\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum possible f(P)\n        \n            if K > max_f or K < 0:  # Check if K is out of bounds\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                # Start with the descending permutation\n                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                current_f = max_f  # Start with the maximum f(P)\n            \n                # Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K\n                for i in range(N - 1):\n                    if current_f == K:\n                        break\n                    # If we can reduce the current_f by 1, we swap elements\n                    if current_f > K:\n                        # Swap the last two elements to reduce the f(P) value\n                        permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                        current_f -= 1  # Decrease the f(P) value by 1\n            \n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))  # Store the result as a string\n\n        # Print all results at once for efficiency\n        print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n    ```\n\n    This summary encapsulates the core concepts, strategies attempted, and the lessons learned from the problem-solving process.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is \\(N \\times (N - 1) / 2\\).\n\n    #### Key Concepts:\n    1. **Maximum and Minimum Values of f(P):** The maximum value occurs with a descending permutation, while the minimum is 0 (for N = 1).\n    2. **Adjustment of Permutation:** The challenge was to adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K by swapping elements to reduce the contribution of adjacent maximums.\n\n    #### Strategies and Issues:\n    - The initial approach involved starting with a descending permutation and attempting to reduce f(P) by swapping adjacent elements. However, this logic was flawed as it did not effectively account for how adjacent maximums changed with swaps.\n    - The code consistently returned `-1` for valid cases, indicating a failure to construct the desired permutation.\n\n    #### Lessons Learned:\n    - A more systematic approach is needed to generate permutations that can achieve specific values of K. The adjustment logic must be refined to ensure that all possible values of f(P) can be reached.\n    - Future implementations should focus on a clearer strategy for adjusting the permutation based on the difference between the current f(P) and the target K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n    The following code snippet represents the last attempt, which ultimately failed to pass the test cases:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n        results = []  # To store results for each test case\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum possible f(P)\n        \n            if K > max_f or K < 0:  # Check if K is out of bounds\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                # Start with the descending permutation\n                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                current_f = max_f  # Start with the maximum f(P)\n            \n                # Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K\n                for i in range(N - 1):\n                    if current_f == K:\n                        break\n                    # If we can reduce the current_f by 1, we swap elements\n                    if current_f > K:\n                        # Swap the last two elements to reduce the f(P) value\n                        permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                        current_f -= 1  # Decrease the f(P) value by 1\n            \n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))  # Store the result as a string\n\n        # Print all results at once for efficiency\n        print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n    ```\n\n    This summary encapsulates the core concepts, strategies attempted, and the lessons learned from the problem-solving process.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

It constructs the first line by simply joining numbers from 0 to n-1, which is straightforward. For the subsequent lines, it uses a list to manage the current sequence of numbers, modifying it by popping the last element and prepending the next number in the sequence. This method effectively builds the required pattern without unnecessary complexity.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n1. **Initialization**: It initializes a list to hold the current sequence of numbers, which simplifies the process of modifying the sequence for each line.\n2. **Efficient Updates**: By using list operations (like `pop` and list concatenation), it efficiently updates the sequence for each line without needing to recreate it from scratch.\n3. **Direct Output**: The solution directly prints the results after constructing each line, ensuring that the output format is maintained correctly.\n\nOverall, the official solution is more concise and effectively addresses the problem requirements, highlighting the importance of understanding the problem statement and leveraging efficient data structures for manipulation."
