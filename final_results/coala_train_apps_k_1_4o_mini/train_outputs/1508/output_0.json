    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The chef needs help generating a specific pattern based on an integer input K for multiple test cases. For each test case, the output should be a series of lines where each line contains a sequence of numbers that starts from 0 and counts down to the current line number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   For each test case with a given K, we need to print K lines. The first line will contain just the number 0, the second line will contain the numbers 0 and 1, the third line will contain the numbers 0, 1, and 2, and so on, until the K-th line, which will contain numbers from 0 up to K-1. After that, we need to print the same lines but in reverse order, starting from K-1 down to 0.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function print_pattern(T, test_cases):\n       for each test case in test_cases:\n           read K\n           for i from 0 to K-1:\n               print numbers from 0 to i\n           for i from K-1 down to 0:\n               print numbers from 0 to i\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef print_pattern(T, test_cases):\n    # Iterate through each test case\n    for k in test_cases:\n        K = k  # Get the value of K for the current test case\n        \n        # Print the first part of the pattern\n        for i in range(K):\n            # Create a line with numbers from 0 to i\n            line = ''.join(str(x) for x in range(i + 1))\n            print(line)\n        \n        # Print the second part of the pattern\n        for i in range(K - 1, -1, -1):\n            # Create a line with numbers from 0 to i\n            line = ''.join(str(x) for x in range(i + 1))\n            print(line)\n\n# Read input from standard input\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(T)]\nprint_pattern(T, test_cases)\n```",
