    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We have an infinite binary tree where each node has a specific labeling and structure. Given two nodes `u` and `v`, we need to find out how many pairs of nodes `(w, t)` exist such that the path taken to traverse from `w` to `t` is the same as the path taken from `u` to `v`. The nodes are constrained to a maximum label of `n`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we need to determine the path from `u` to `v` in the binary tree. This involves finding their lowest common ancestor (LCA) and the unique path from `u` to `v` through the LCA. Once we have this path, we can count how many pairs `(w, t)` can be formed that share the same path configuration. The pairs will be determined by the number of nodes that can be reached from the LCA to the left and right subtrees.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function find_lca(u, v):\n       while u != v:\n           if u > v:\n               u = u // 2\n           else:\n               v = v // 2\n       return u\n\n   function count_pairs(n, u, v):\n       lca = find_lca(u, v)\n       left_count = (lca - 1) // 2  # Count of nodes in the left subtree\n       right_count = n - lca        # Count of nodes in the right subtree\n       return (left_count + 1) * (right_count + 1)\n\n   function main():\n       read Q\n       for each query:\n           read n, u, v\n           result = count_pairs(n, u, v)\n           print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef find_lca(u, v):\n    # This function finds the lowest common ancestor of nodes u and v\n    while u != v:\n        if u > v:\n            u //= 2  # Move u to its parent\n        else:\n            v //= 2  # Move v to its parent\n    return u  # When u equals v, we found the LCA\n\ndef count_pairs(n, u, v):\n    # Find the lowest common ancestor of u and v\n    lca = find_lca(u, v)\n    \n    # Count the number of nodes in the left subtree of the LCA\n    left_count = (lca - 1) // 2  # All nodes from 1 to lca-1 that are in the left subtree\n    # Count the number of nodes in the right subtree of the LCA\n    right_count = n - lca  # All nodes from lca+1 to n that are in the right subtree\n    \n    # The total pairs (w, t) that can be formed\n    return (left_count + 1) * (right_count + 1)\n\ndef main():\n    Q = int(input())  # Read the number of queries\n    for _ in range(Q):\n        n, u, v = map(int, input().split())  # Read n, u, v for each query\n        result = count_pairs(n, u, v)  # Calculate the result for the query\n        print(result)  # Output the result\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n```",
