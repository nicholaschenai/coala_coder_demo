    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to count pairs of nodes `(w, t)` in an infinite binary tree such that the path configuration from `w` to `t` is the same as from `u` to `v`. The tree structure is defined such that each node `v` has two children: `2 * v` (left) and `2 * v + 1` (right). The challenge involved correctly identifying the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the nodes and counting the valid pairs based on the subtrees of the LCA.\n\nInitially, the approach involved finding the LCA using a loop that moved up the tree until both nodes matched. However, the counting logic for the left and right subtrees was flawed. The left subtree was incorrectly counted as `(lca - 1) // 2`, and the right subtree as `n - lca`. This led to incorrect outputs for the test cases.\n\nThe key learning was that the counts should reflect the actual number of nodes reachable from the LCA down to its leftmost and rightmost leaves. The correct counting should consider all nodes from `1` to `lca - 1` for the left subtree and from `lca + 1` to `n` for the right subtree. \n\nDespite multiple attempts to fix the counting logic, the outputs remained incorrect, indicating a deeper misunderstanding of how to calculate the valid pairs based on the tree structure. The final code structure was as follows:\n\n```python\ndef find_lca(u, v):\n    while u != v:\n        if u > v:\n            u //= 2\n        else:\n            v //= 2\n    return u\n\ndef count_pairs(n, u, v):\n    lca = find_lca(u, v)\n    left_count = lca - 1  # Count of nodes in the left subtree\n    right_count = n - lca  # Count of nodes in the right subtree\n    return (left_count + 1) * (right_count + 1)\n\ndef main():\n    Q = int(input())\n    for _ in range(Q):\n        n, u, v = map(int, input().split())\n        result = count_pairs(n, u, v)\n        print(result)\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of accurately understanding tree structures and the relationships between nodes when solving problems involving paths and configurations.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\nIn my attempts to solve the problem of counting pairs `(w, t)` such that the path configuration from `w` to `t` is the same as from `u` to `v`, I encountered several issues primarily related to the counting of nodes in the left and right subtrees of the lowest common ancestor (LCA). My initial approach incorrectly calculated the number of nodes in these subtrees, leading to incorrect outputs for the test cases.\n\nThe official solution provided a more effective method by leveraging binary representations of the nodes. It compared the binary strings of the left and right nodes to find the longest common prefix, which directly relates to the structure of the binary tree. This approach allowed for a more straightforward calculation of the valid pairs by determining how many nodes could be formed based on the remaining bits after the common prefix.\n\nKey insights from the official solution include:\n1. **Binary Representation:** Using binary strings to represent node labels simplifies the problem of finding common paths in the binary tree.\n2. **Common Prefix Matching:** By identifying the longest common prefix of the binary representations of `l` and `r`, the solution efficiently narrows down the potential pairs.\n3. **Dynamic Calculation of Valid Nodes:** The solution dynamically calculates the number of valid nodes based on the remaining bits after the common prefix, ensuring that it adheres to the constraints of the maximum node label `n`.\n\nOverall, the official solution is more efficient and directly addresses the problem requirements by utilizing properties of binary trees and their representations, which I did not fully leverage in my attempts. This experience highlights the importance of considering different representations and approaches when tackling problems related to tree structures.",
