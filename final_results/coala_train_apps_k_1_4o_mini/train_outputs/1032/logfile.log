[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Help Saurabh with his Chemistry Assignment.

Saurabh has been given a chemistry assignment by Ruby Mam. Though the assignment is simple but

Saurabh has to watch India vs Pakistan Match and he has no time to do the assignment by himself.

So Saurabh wants you to do his assignment so that he doesnâ€™t get scolded by Ruby Mam . The assignment

is as follows , Suppose there are X particles initially at time t=0 in a box. At a time t the number of particles in

box becomes t times the number of particles at time t-1 . You will be given N and X where N is time at which the

number of particles in box is to be calculated and X is the number of particles at time t=0.

-----Input-----
The first line will contain the integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two space

separated integers N and X .

-----Output-----
For each test case, output the answer to the query. Since the output can be very large, output the answer modulo

10^6+3

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 100000
- 1 â‰¤ N,X â‰¤ 10^18

-----Example-----
Input:
2
1 2
2 1

Output:
2
2

-----Explanation-----
Example case 2.At t=0 particles are 1 ,so at t=1 ,particles are 1*1 = 1 particles. At t=2, particles are 2*1 = 2 particles.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1032 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Saurabh needs to calculate the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. The number of particles at time `t` is determined by multiplying the number of particles at time `t-1` by `t`. The results can be very large, so we need to return the result modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve the problem, we need to compute the number of particles at time `N` based on the formula:
   - At `t=0`, particles = `X`
   - At `t=1`, particles = `1 * X`
   - At `t=2`, particles = `2 * (1 * X)`
   - At `t=3`, particles = `3 * (2 * (1 * X))`
   - And so on, until `t=N`.
   
   This can be simplified to:
   - Particles at time `N` = `X * N!` (N factorial).
   
   However, since `N` can be very large (up to \(10^{18}\)), calculating `N!` directly is impractical. Instead, we can use properties of modular arithmetic and the fact that \(N! \mod (10^6 + 3)\) will repeat after a certain point due to the factorial growth and the modulus.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function calculate_particles(N, X):
       MOD = 1000003
       if N >= MOD:
           return 0  // because N! will have MOD as a factor
       factorial = 1
       for i from 1 to N:
           factorial = (factorial * i) % MOD
       return (factorial * X) % MOD

   function main():
       read T
       for each test case:
           read N, X
           result = calculate_particles(N, X)
           print result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def calculate_particles(N, X):
    MOD = 1000003
    # If N is greater than or equal to MOD, the result will be 0
    if N >= MOD:
        return 0  # because N! will have MOD as a factor
    factorial = 1
    # Calculate N! % MOD
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        factorial = (factorial * i) % MOD
    # Return (N! * X) % MOD
    return (factorial * X) % MOD

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine how many times first, second, and third-year students would be present on campus together over a specified number of days, given their respective arrival intervals. The key concept involved calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals (x, y, z) to find out when all students would be on campus simultaneously.

    The solution involved defining helper functions to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM, followed by a main function to read input values and compute the total number of occurrences based on the LCM. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and modular arithmetic to achieve the desired results.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against the provided test case. No unexpected errors occurred during the process, and the solution was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints. The use of integer division ensured that the results were accurate without any floating-point issues. 

    Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of understanding number theory concepts like GCD and LCM in solving problems related to periodic events. The code snippet for future reference is as follows:

    ```python
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b != 0:
            temp = b
            b = a % b
            a = temp
        return a

    def lcm(a, b):
        return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

    def lcm_of_three(x, y, z):
        return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)

    def count_audience(N, x, y, z):
        total_hours = N * 24
        lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
        return total_hours // lcm_value

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
        result = count_audience(N, x, y, z)
        print(result)

INFO - [Task id] 1032 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to compute the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. The number of particles at time `N` is determined by the formula \(X \times N!\), and the result needs to be output modulo \(10^6 + 3\). 

The main challenge was handling the potentially large values of `N` (up to \(10^{18}\)), which made direct computation of `N!` impractical. The solution involved recognizing that if `N` is greater than or equal to \(10^6 + 3\), the factorial would be zero modulo that value. For smaller values of `N`, I implemented a function to compute the factorial modulo \(10^6 + 3\) iteratively.

The final implementation successfully handled multiple test cases and provided the correct outputs. The key takeaway was the importance of modular arithmetic in managing large numbers and the efficiency gained by avoiding unnecessary calculations when `N` exceeds the modulus. 

Hereâ€™s the core code snippet for reference:

```python
def factorial_mod(n, m):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result = (result * i) % m
    return result

def solve_case(N, X, M):
    if N >= M:
        return 0
    else:
        fact_mod = factorial_mod(N, M)
        return (fact_mod * X) % M
``` 

This approach effectively balances the need for accuracy with the constraints of large input sizes.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Help Saurabh with his Chemistry Assignment.

Saurabh has been given a chemistry assignment by Ruby Mam. Though the assignment is simple but

Saurabh has to watch India vs Pakistan Match and he has no time to do the assignment by himself.

So Saurabh wants you to do his assignment so that he doesnâ€™t get scolded by Ruby Mam . The assignment

is as follows , Suppose there are X particles initially at time t=0 in a box. At a time t the number of particles in

box becomes t times the number of particles at time t-1 . You will be given N and X where N is time at which the

number of particles in box is to be calculated and X is the number of particles at time t=0.

-----Input-----
The first line will contain the integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two space

separated integers N and X .

-----Output-----
For each test case, output the answer to the query. Since the output can be very large, output the answer modulo

10^6+3

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 100000
- 1 â‰¤ N,X â‰¤ 10^18

-----Example-----
Input:
2
1 2
2 1

Output:
2
2

-----Explanation-----
Example case 2.At t=0 particles are 1 ,so at t=1 ,particles are 1*1 = 1 particles. At t=2, particles are 2*1 = 2 particles.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1032 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem requires us to calculate the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. The number of particles at time `t` is determined by multiplying the number of particles at time `t-1` by `t`. The output should be the number of particles at time `N`, modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to recognize that the number of particles grows factorially. Specifically, the number of particles at time `N` can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{particles}(N) = X \times N!
   \]
   Since `N` can be very large (up to \(10^{18}\)), calculating `N!` directly is impractical. Instead, we can use properties of modular arithmetic to compute the result efficiently. We will compute `N!` modulo \(10^6 + 3\) and then multiply it by `X`, also taking the result modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define a function to compute factorial modulo M
   Define a function to handle each test case
   Read the number of test cases T
   For each test case:
       Read N and X
       If N >= M (where M = 10^6 + 3):
           Output 0 (since N! will be 0 mod M)
       Else:
           Compute N! mod M
           Compute result = (N! * X) mod M
           Output result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def factorial_mod(n, m):
    # Function to compute n! % m
    result = 1

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
a = [1]
M = 10**6 + 3
for ii in range(1, 1000005):
 a.append((a[-1]*ii)%M)
for __ in range(eval(input())):
 n, x = list(map(int, input().split()))
 if n>=M: print(0)
 else: print((a[n]*x)%M)


INFO - [Task id] 1032 [generation text] The official solution effectively precomputes the factorial values modulo \(10^6 + 3\) for all integers from 0 to \(10^6 + 2\). This approach allows for constant-time retrieval of factorial values during each test case, significantly improving efficiency compared to calculating the factorial on-the-fly, especially given the constraints where \(N\) can be as large as \(10^{18}\).

Key insights from the official solution:
1. **Precomputation**: By precomputing the factorials up to \(10^6 + 2\) and storing them in a list, the solution avoids repeated calculations, which is crucial for handling up to 100,000 test cases efficiently.
2. **Immediate Check for Large N**: The solution checks if \(N\) is greater than or equal to \(M\) (i.e., \(10^6 + 3\)). If so, it directly outputs 0, as \(N!\) would be 0 modulo \(M\). This is a clever optimization that leverages properties of modular arithmetic.
3. **Constant Time Retrieval**: For valid \(N\), the solution retrieves the precomputed factorial and multiplies it by \(X\), again taking the result modulo \(M\). This ensures that each test case runs in constant time after the initial precomputation.

In contrast, my initial approach involved calculating the factorial for each test case, which would be inefficient for large \(N\). The official solution's method of precomputation and direct access is a more optimal strategy for this problem, especially given the constraints. This experience highlights the importance of considering precomputation in problems involving repeated calculations over a range of inputs.
