The number of particles at time `t` is determined by multiplying the number of particles at time `t-1` by `t`. The results can be very large, so we need to return the result modulo \\(10^6 + 3\\).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve the problem, we need to compute the number of particles at time `N` based on the formula:\n   - At `t=0`, particles = `X`\n   - At `t=1`, particles = `1 * X`\n   - At `t=2`, particles = `2 * (1 * X)`\n   - At `t=3`, particles = `3 * (2 * (1 * X))`\n   - And so on, until `t=N`.\n   \n   This can be simplified to:\n   - Particles at time `N` = `X * N!` (N factorial).\n   \n   However, since `N` can be very large (up to \\(10^{18}\\)), calculating `N!` directly is impractical. Instead, we can use properties of modular arithmetic and the fact that \\(N! \\mod (10^6 + 3)\\) will repeat after a certain point due to the factorial growth and the modulus.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function calculate_particles(N, X):\n       MOD = 1000003\n       if N >= MOD:\n           return 0  // because N! will have MOD as a factor\n       factorial = 1\n       for i from 1 to N:\n           factorial = (factorial * i) % MOD\n       return (factorial * X) % MOD\n\n   function main():\n       read T\n       for each test case:\n           read N, X\n           result = calculate_particles(N, X)\n           print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef calculate_particles(N, X):\n    MOD = 1000003\n    # If N is greater than or equal to MOD, the result will be 0\n    if N >= MOD:\n        return 0  # because N! will have MOD as a factor\n    factorial = 1\n    # Calculate N! % MOD\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        factorial = (factorial * i) % MOD\n    # Return (N! * X) % MOD\n    return (factorial * X) % MOD\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n    results = []\n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        N, X = map(int, data[i].split())\n        result = calculate_particles(N, X)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    # Print all results\n    sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n```"

If so, it directly outputs 0, as \\(N!\\) would be 0 modulo \\(M\\).
