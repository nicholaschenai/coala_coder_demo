If such a pair exists, we will output \"YES\"; otherwise, we will output \"NO\".\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store zebra positions and their spit targets.\n   - For each zebra, read its position and spit distance.\n   - Calculate the target position where the spit lands.\n   - Store this information in the dictionary.\n   - After processing all zebras, iterate through the dictionary:\n     - For each zebra's position, check if the target position exists in the dictionary and if the spit from that target position returns to the original zebra's position.\n   - If such a pair is found, print \"YES\".

The key concept involved calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals (x, y, z) to find out when all students would be on campus simultaneously.\n\n    The solution involved defining helper functions to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM, followed by a main function to read input values and compute the total number of occurrences based on the LCM. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and modular arithmetic to achieve the desired results.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against the provided test case. No unexpected errors occurred during the process, and the solution was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints. The use of integer division ensured that the results were accurate without any floating-point issues. \n\n    Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of understanding number theory concepts like GCD and LCM in solving problems related to periodic events.

It can also apply to problems in computer science related to graph theory, where nodes (zebras) have directed edges (spits) and you need to find reciprocal connections."
