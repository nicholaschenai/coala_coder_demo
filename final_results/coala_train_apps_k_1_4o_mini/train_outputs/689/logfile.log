INFO - [Task id] 689 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a number of zebras in a jungle, each located at a specific position. Each zebra spits a certain distance either to the right or to the left. We need to determine if there are any two zebras that spit at each other, meaning that one zebra's spit lands on the position of another zebra that spits back to the first zebra's position.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to map each zebra's position to the position it spits to. We will then check if any zebra's spit lands on another zebra's position and if that zebra spits back to the first zebra's position. If such a pair exists, we will output "YES"; otherwise, we will output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store zebra positions and their spit targets.
   - For each zebra, read its position and spit distance.
   - Calculate the target position where the spit lands.
   - Store this information in the dictionary.
   - After processing all zebras, iterate through the dictionary:
     - For each zebra's position, check if the target position exists in the dictionary and if the spit from that target position returns to the original zebra's position.
   - If such a pair is found, print "YES". If no pairs are found after checking all, print "NO".

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def are_zebras_spitting_at_each_other(t, records):
    # Dictionary to store zebra positions and their spit targets
    spit_map = {}
    
    # Process each zebra's position and spit distance

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine how many times first, second, and third-year students would be present on campus together over a specified number of days, given their respective arrival intervals. The key concept involved calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals (x, y, z) to find out when all students would be on campus simultaneously.

    The solution involved defining helper functions to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM, followed by a main function to read input values and compute the total number of occurrences based on the LCM. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and modular arithmetic to achieve the desired results.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against the provided test case. No unexpected errors occurred during the process, and the solution was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints. The use of integer division ensured that the results were accurate without any floating-point issues. 

    Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of understanding number theory concepts like GCD and LCM in solving problems related to periodic events. The code snippet for future reference is as follows:

    ```python
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b != 0:
            temp = b
            b = a % b
            a = temp
        return a

    def lcm(a, b):
        return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

    def lcm_of_three(x, y, z):
        return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)

    def count_audience(N, x, y, z):
        total_hours = N * 24
        lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
        return total_hours // lcm_value

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
        result = count_audience(N, x, y, z)
        print(result)
    ```

INFO - [Task id] 689 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem involves determining if there are two zebras in a jungle that spit at each other. Each zebra has a specific position and a distance it spits. If a zebra at position `a` spits `b` meters, it can hit another zebra located at position `a + b`. We need to check if there exists a pair of zebras such that one zebra spits at the other and vice versa.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to map each zebra's position to the position it spits at. We will iterate through each zebra's data, calculate the target position based on its spit distance, and check if the target zebra exists in our dictionary. If we find a zebra that spits back to the original zebra's position, we can conclude that they spit at each other.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize an empty dictionary to store zebra positions and their spit targets
   For each zebra in the input:
       Read position a and spit distance b
       Calculate target position as a + b
       Store the target position in the dictionary with the key as a
   For each zebra in the input again:
       Read position a and spit distance b
       Calculate target position as a + b
       Check if the target position exists in the dictionary and if it points back to a

INFO - [Task id] 689 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine if there are two zebras in a jungle that spit at each other based on their positions and spit distances. The solution involved using a dictionary to map each zebra's position to the position it spits at. The core concept was to check for reciprocal spitting, meaning if zebra A spits at zebra B, then zebra B should also spit back at zebra A.

The approach was straightforward: first, populate a dictionary with each zebra's spit target, and then check if any zebra's spit target points back to its original position. This method efficiently checks for the required condition in linear time.

The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against the provided test case. The solution was effective, and no unexpected errors occurred during the process. The key takeaway is the utility of using a dictionary for quick lookups, which is essential for problems involving relationships between elements. 

Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

```python
def find_zebras(t, zebras):
    spit_map = {}
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = zebras[i]
        spit_map[a] = a + b
    
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = zebras[i]
        target_position = a + b
        if target_position in spit_map and spit_map[target_position] == a:
            print("YES")
            return
    
    print("NO")

t = int(input())
zebras = []
for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    zebras.append((a, b))

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 689 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem involves determining if there are two zebras in a jungle that spit at each other. Each zebra has a specific position and a distance it spits. If a zebra at position `a` spits `b` meters, it can hit another zebra located at position `a + b`. We need to check if there exists a pair of zebras such that one zebra spits at the other and vice versa.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to map each zebra's position to the position it spits at. We will iterate through each zebra's data, calculate the target position based on its spit distance, and check if the target zebra exists in our dictionary. If we find a zebra that spits back to the original zebra's position, we can conclude that they spit at each other.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize an empty dictionary to store zebra positions and their spit targets
   For each zebra in the input:
       Read position a and spit distance b
       Calculate target position as a + b
       Store the target position in the dictionary with the key as a
   For each zebra in the input again:
       Read position a and spit distance b
       Calculate target position as a + b
       Check if the target position exists in the dictionary and if it points back to a
       If found, print "YES" and exit
   If no pairs found, print "NO"
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def find_zebras(t, zebras):
    # Create a dictionary to store the spit targets
    spit_map = {}
    
    # First pass: populate the spit_map with positions and their spit targets
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = zebras[i]
        spit_map[a] = a + b  # Store the target position for zebra at position a
    
    # Second pass: check for reciprocal spitting
    for i in range(t):

        target_position = a + b  # Calculate where this zebra spits
        # Check if the target zebra exists and if it spits back to the original zebra

INFO - [Task id] 689 [generation text] The official solution effectively uses a dictionary to map each zebra's position to the position it spits at, similar to my approach. However, it simplifies the checking process by directly iterating over the keys of the dictionary to find reciprocal spitting. 

Key insights from the official solution:
1. **Single Dictionary Usage**: The solution maintains a single dictionary to store the spit targets, which reduces the need for multiple passes over the data.
2. **Direct Checking**: Instead of storing the spit targets in a separate structure, it checks for reciprocal spitting directly within the same loop that processes the input.
3. **Boolean Flag**: The use of a simple boolean flag (`a`) to indicate if a pair was found is straightforward and efficient.

My approach was similar but involved two separate passes over the data, which could be seen as less efficient. The official solution's method of checking for reciprocal spitting in a single loop is more elegant and concise. 

Overall, the official solution is effective in both time and space complexity, and it highlights the importance of minimizing the number of iterations over the data when possible. This experience reinforces the value of direct checks and efficient data structure usage in problem-solving.

The main function is `find_zebras`.
INFO - [Task id] 689 [generation text] The function processes a list of zebras, each defined by their position and a target position determined by their spitting distance. It first creates a mapping of each zebra's position to its target position. Then, it checks for reciprocal spitting by verifying if a zebra's target position points back to its original position. If such a pair is found, it outputs "YES" and terminates; otherwise, it concludes by printing "NO" if no pairs are identified. The function effectively determines if any two zebras spit at each other based on their defined positions and distances.
