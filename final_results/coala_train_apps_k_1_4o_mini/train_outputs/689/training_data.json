    "summary": "In this task, the goal was to determine if there are two zebras in a jungle that spit at each other based on their positions and spit distances. The solution involved using a dictionary to map each zebra's position to the position it spits at. The core concept was to check for reciprocal spitting, meaning if zebra A spits at zebra B, then zebra B should also spit back at zebra A.\n\nThe approach was straightforward: first, populate a dictionary with each zebra's spit target, and then check if any zebra's spit target points back to its original position. This method efficiently checks for the required condition in linear time.\n\nThe final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against the provided test case. The solution was effective, and no unexpected errors occurred during the process. The key takeaway is the utility of using a dictionary for quick lookups, which is essential for problems involving relationships between elements. \n\nHere\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n```python\ndef find_zebras(t, zebras):\n    spit_map = {}\n    for i in range(t):\n        a, b = zebras[i]\n        spit_map[a] = a + b\n    \n    for i in range(t):\n        a, b = zebras[i]\n        target_position = a + b\n        if target_position in spit_map and spit_map[target_position] == a:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            return\n    \n    print(\"NO\")\n\nt = int(input())\nzebras = []\nfor _ in range(t):\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    zebras.append((a, b))\n\nfind_zebras(t, zebras)\n```",
    "reflection": "The official solution effectively uses a dictionary to map each zebra's position to the position it spits at, similar to my approach. However, it simplifies the checking process by directly iterating over the keys of the dictionary to find reciprocal spitting. \n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n1. **Single Dictionary Usage**: The solution maintains a single dictionary to store the spit targets, which reduces the need for multiple passes over the data.\n2. **Direct Checking**: Instead of storing the spit targets in a separate structure, it checks for reciprocal spitting directly within the same loop that processes the input.\n3. **Boolean Flag**: The use of a simple boolean flag (`a`) to indicate if a pair was found is straightforward and efficient.\n\nMy approach was similar but involved two separate passes over the data, which could be seen as less efficient. The official solution's method of checking for reciprocal spitting in a single loop is more elegant and concise. \n\nOverall, the official solution is effective in both time and space complexity, and it highlights the importance of minimizing the number of iterations over the data when possible. This experience reinforces the value of direct checks and efficient data structure usage in problem-solving.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: find_zebras]\nThe function processes a list of zebras, each defined by their position and a target position determined by their spitting distance. It first creates a mapping of each zebra's position to its target position. Then, it checks for reciprocal spitting by verifying if a zebra's target position points back to its original position. If such a pair is found, it outputs \"YES\" and terminates; otherwise, it concludes by printing \"NO\" if no pairs are identified. The function effectively determines if any two zebras spit at each other based on their defined positions and distances.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge would be useful in scenarios where you need to analyze interactions between entities based on their positions and actions, such as in simulations of animal behavior, game development involving character interactions, or even in logistics where items are moved in a space and their interactions need to be tracked. It can also apply to problems in computer science related to graph theory, where nodes (zebras) have directed edges (spits) and you need to find reciprocal connections."
