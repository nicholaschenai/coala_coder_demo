INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Dr. S. De assigns scores to students based on the complexity of questions they solve. Each student starts with a score of 10. When a student solves a question of a certain complexity, their score is multiplied by that complexity. Given multiple questions and the range of students who can solve them, we need to calculate the mean of the maximum scores of all students after all questions have been assigned.

2. **Conceptualize a solution:**
   - Start by initializing a list of scores for all students, each set to 10.
   - For each question, update the scores of the specified range of students by multiplying their current score by the complexity of the question.
   - After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and return the floor value of that mean.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function calculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, M
           initialize scores list with 10 for each student
           for each question in M:
               read i, j, k
               for student in range(i to j):
                   scores[student] *= k
           mean_score = sum(scores) // N
           print mean_score
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 solution:**
```python
def calculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, M = case[0]
        scores = [10] * N  # Initialize scores for N students
        for question in case[1]:
            i, j, k = question
            for student in range(i - 1, j):  # Adjusting for 0-based index
                scores[student] *= k
        mean_score = sum(scores) // N  # Calculate floor of mean
        results.append(mean_score)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a list of books numbered from 1 to N. The key insight was recognizing that the solution involves finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement of books. The minimum moves needed to sort the array can be calculated using the formula: 

    \[ \text{Minimum Moves} = N - \text{length of LIS} \]

    Initially, I attempted to solve the problem by counting how many books were already in their correct positions, which led to incorrect results. The mistake was in assuming that simply counting correct positions would yield the number of moves needed. 

    The correct approach involved implementing a function to calculate the LIS using a dynamic programming technique combined with binary search for efficiency. This allowed for a more accurate determination of the number of moves required.

    The final solution included two functions: one for calculating the length of the LIS and another for computing the minimum moves based on that length. The code successfully passed all tests, confirming the effectiveness of the approach.

    ### Final Code Snippet
    ```python
    def length_of_LIS(books):
        if not books:
            return 0
        lis = []
        for book in books:
            left, right = 0, len(lis)
            while left < right:
                mid = (left + right) // 2
                if lis[mid] < book:
                    left = mid + 1
                else:
                    right = mid
            if left == len(lis):
                lis.append(book)
            else:
                lis[left] = book
        return len(lis)

    def min_moves_to_sort(N, books):
        lis_length = length_of_LIS(books)
        return N - lis_length

    N = int(input())
    books = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(min_moves_to_sort(N, books))
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the underlying patterns in sorting problems and the utility of LIS in optimizing solutions.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves calculating the mean of the maximum scores of students after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the question if they are within a specified roll number range. We need to compute the mean score for all students after all questions have been processed.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - Start by initializing a list of scores for all students, each set to 10.
   - For each question, determine the range of students affected and multiply their scores by the complexity of the question.
   - After processing all questions, calculate the mean score by summing all the scores and dividing by the number of students, then take the floor of that value.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function calculate_mean_scores(T):
       for each testcase in T:
           read N, M
           initialize scores list with 10 for each student
           for each question in M:

Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the question if they are within a specified roll number range. We need to compute the mean score for all students after all questions have been processed.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - Start by initializing a list of scores for all students, each set to 10.
   - For each question, determine the range of students affected and multiply their scores by the complexity of the question.
   - After processing all questions, calculate the mean score by summing all the scores and dividing by the number of students, then take the floor of that value.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function calculate_mean_scores(T):
       for each testcase in T:
           read N, M
           initialize scores list with 10 for each student
           for each question in M:
               read i, j, k
               for student in range(i to j):
                   scores[student] *= k
           mean_score = sum(scores) // N
           print mean_score
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def calculate_mean_scores(T):
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read number of students and number of questions

INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to compute the mean of maximum scores for students after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the question if they fall within a specified roll number range. 

The approach involved initializing a list of scores for all students, processing each question to update the scores based on the given range and complexity, and finally calculating the mean score. The solution was implemented efficiently to handle the constraints, particularly the potential large input sizes.

The final code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic for updating scores was straightforward. The key takeaway was the importance of managing index conversions (from 1-based to 0-based) when processing the roll number ranges. The solution passed the provided test case, confirming its correctness. 

Here’s the final code snippet for future reference:

```python
def calculate_mean_scores(T):
    for _ in range(T):
        N, M = map(int, input().split())
        scores = [10] * N
        for _ in range(M):
            i, j, k = map(int, input().split())
            for student in range(i - 1, j):  # Convert to 0-based index
                scores[student] *= k
        mean_score = sum(scores) // N
        print(mean_score)

T = int(input())
calculate_mean_scores(T)
``` 

This experience reinforced the importance of careful index management and efficient score updates in competitive programming scenarios.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Dr. S. De teaches computer architecture in NIT Patna. Whenever he comes across any good question(with complexity $k$), he gives that question to students within roll number range $i$ and $j$
At the start of semester he assigns score of $10$ to every student in his class if a student submits a question of complexity $k$, his score gets multiplied by $k$
This month he gave $M$ questions and he is wondering what will be mean of maximum scores of all the student. He is busy in improving his finger print attendance module, can you help him?
Input file may be large so try to use fast input output

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a First line of input, two integers $N, M$ i.e. Number of students in the class and number of questions given in this month. 
- Next $M$ lines contains 3 integers -$i, j, k$ i.e. starting roll number, end roll number and complexity of the question

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line answer - $floor$ value of Mean of maximum possible score for all students.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N, M \leq 10^5$

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
try:
 t=int(input())
 for a in range(t):
  l=input().split()
  n=int(l[0])
  m=int(l[1])
  d={}
  s=0
  for b in range(m):
   l1=input().split()
   i=int(l1[0])
   j=int(l1[1])
   k=int(l1[2])
   for c in range(i,j+1):
    if c not in d:
     d[c]=10
   for c in range(i,j+1):
    d[c]=d[c]*k
  for i in d:
   s=s+d[i]
  print(s//n)
except:
 pass

INFO - [Task id] 997 [generation text] The official solution employs a dictionary to track the scores of students, which allows for more efficient updates and avoids the need to initialize a large list for all students. This approach is particularly beneficial when the number of students (N) is large but not all students are affected by the questions. 

Key insights from the official solution:

1. **Use of Dictionary**: Instead of maintaining a fixed-size list for all students, the solution uses a dictionary (`d`) to store scores only for students who are affected by the questions. This reduces memory usage and potentially speeds up score updates.

2. **Score Initialization**: The dictionary is initialized with a score of 10 for each student only when they are first affected by a question. This avoids unnecessary initializations for students who do not participate in any questions.

3. **Efficient Score Updates**: The solution updates scores in two passes: first to ensure all affected students have an initial score, and then to apply the complexity multiplier. This separation of concerns can make the code clearer and easier to debug.

4. **Final Score Calculation**: The final mean score is calculated by summing the scores stored in the dictionary and dividing by the total number of students, ensuring that the output is the floor value of the mean.

Overall, the official solution is more efficient in terms of both time and space complexity, especially for cases where many students are not involved in the questions. This experience highlights the importance of considering data structures that can dynamically adjust to the problem's requirements, rather than relying on fixed-size structures.
