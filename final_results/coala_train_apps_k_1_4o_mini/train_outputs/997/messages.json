He is busy in improving his finger print attendance module, can you help him?\nInput file may be large so try to use fast input output\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases.

When a student solves a question of a certain complexity, their score is multiplied by that complexity. Given multiple questions and the range of students who can solve them, we need to calculate the mean of the maximum scores of all students after all questions have been assigned.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution:**\n   - Start by initializing a list of scores for all students, each set to 10.\n   - For each question, update the scores of the specified range of students by multiplying their current score by the complexity of the question.\n   - After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and return the floor value of that mean.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function calculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read N, M\n           initialize scores list with 10 for each student\n           for each question in M:\n               read i, j, k\n               for student in range(i to j):\n                   scores[student] *= k\n           mean_score = sum(scores) // N\n           print mean_score\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 solution:**\n```python\ndef calculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N, M = case[0]\n        scores = [10] * N  # Initialize scores for N students\n        for question in case[1]:\n            i, j, k = question\n            for student in range(i - 1, j):  # Adjusting for 0-based index\n                scores[student] *= k\n        mean_score = sum(scores) // N  # Calculate floor of mean\n        results.append(mean_score)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Reading input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().splitlines()\n\nT = int(data[0])\ntest_cases = []\nindex = 1\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N, M = map(int, data[index].split())\n    index += 1\n    questions = []\n    for _ in range(M):\n        i, j, k = map(int, data[index].split())\n        questions.append((i, j, k))\n        index += 1\n    test_cases.append(((N, M), questions))\n\ncalculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases)\n```"

The key insight was recognizing that the solution involves finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the current arrangement of books. The minimum moves needed to sort the array can be calculated using the formula: \n\n    \\[ \\text{Minimum Moves} = N - \\text{length of LIS} \\]\n\n    Initially, I attempted to solve the problem by counting how many books were already in their correct positions, which led to incorrect results. The mistake was in assuming that simply counting correct positions would yield the number of moves needed. \n\n    The correct approach involved implementing a function to calculate the LIS using a dynamic programming technique combined with binary search for efficiency. This allowed for a more accurate determination of the number of moves required.\n\n    The final solution included two functions: one for calculating the length of the LIS and another for computing the minimum moves based on that length. The code successfully passed all tests, confirming the effectiveness of the approach.\n\n    ### Final Code Snippet\n    ```python\n    def length_of_LIS(books):\n        if not books:\n            return 0\n        lis = []\n        for book in books:\n            left, right = 0, len(lis)\n            while left < right:\n                mid = (left + right) // 2\n                if lis[mid] < book:\n                    left = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    right = mid\n            if left == len(lis):\n                lis.append(book)\n            else:\n                lis[left] = book\n        return len(lis)\n\n    def min_moves_to_sort(N, books):\n        lis_length = length_of_LIS(books)\n        return N - lis_length\n\n    N = int(input())\n    books = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))\n    print(min_moves_to_sort(N, books))\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the underlying patterns in sorting problems and the utility of LIS in optimizing solutions.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This approach is particularly beneficial when the number of students (N) is large but not all students are affected by the questions. \n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Use of Dictionary**: Instead of maintaining a fixed-size list for all students, the solution uses a dictionary (`d`) to store scores only for students who are affected by the questions. This reduces memory usage and potentially speeds up score updates.\n\n2. **Score Initialization**: The dictionary is initialized with a score of 10 for each student only when they are first affected by a question. This avoids unnecessary initializations for students who do not participate in any questions.\n\n3. **Efficient Score Updates**: The solution updates scores in two passes: first to ensure all affected students have an initial score, and then to apply the complexity multiplier. This separation of concerns can make the code clearer and easier to debug.\n\n4. **Final Score Calculation**: The final mean score is calculated by summing the scores stored in the dictionary and dividing by the total number of students, ensuring that the output is the floor value of the mean.\n\nOverall, the official solution is more efficient in terms of both time and space complexity, especially for cases where many students are not involved in the questions.

For each test case, it reads the number of students and questions, initializing each student's score to 10. It then iterates through the questions, updating the scores of specified ranges of students by multiplying their scores by a given factor. After processing all questions, it computes the mean score by summing the scores and dividing by the number of students, taking the floor of the result. Finally, it prints the mean score for each test case. This function effectively handles input and output for multiple scenarios in a structured manner.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in educational settings where instructors need to evaluate student performance based on varying levels of complexity in assignments. It can also be applied in competitive programming and algorithm design, where efficient handling of range updates and queries is crucial.
