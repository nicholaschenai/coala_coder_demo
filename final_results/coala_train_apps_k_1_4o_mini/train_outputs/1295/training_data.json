    "summary": "In this task, the goal was to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers for multiple queries, where each query specifies two integers, N and K. The challenge involved efficiently generating Fibonacci numbers up to a potentially large N (up to 10^18) and calculating the sum of the first K Fibonacci numbers.\n\nThe solution involved generating Fibonacci numbers iteratively and storing them in a list. I also precomputed the cumulative sums of these Fibonacci numbers to allow for quick retrieval during query processing. This approach was efficient given the constraints, as it avoided recalculating Fibonacci numbers for each query.\n\nOne key insight was recognizing that if K exceeds N, the result should be 0, as there aren't enough Fibonacci numbers to sum. This check was crucial for handling edge cases.\n\nThe final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was straightforward, leveraging basic list operations and loops. The code was structured to first read the input, generate the necessary Fibonacci numbers, compute their sums, and finally process each query efficiently. \n\nOverall, the experience reinforced the importance of precomputation in optimizing performance for problems involving repeated calculations.",
    "reflection": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers, particularly for large values of N and K, which can go up to \\(10^{18}\\). Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Matrix Exponentiation for Fibonacci Calculation**: The official solution uses a method based on matrix exponentiation to compute Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time. This is crucial for handling large inputs efficiently. The Fibonacci sequence can be represented using matrix multiplication, allowing for fast computation of Fibonacci numbers.\n\n2. **Modular Arithmetic**: The solution incorporates modular arithmetic to prevent overflow and ensure results fit within standard data types. The modulus \\(10^9 + 7\\) is commonly used in competitive programming for this purpose.\n\n3. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: Instead of calculating the sum of Fibonacci numbers directly, the solution uses a mathematical formula that leverages properties of geometric series and Fibonacci numbers. This allows it to compute the required sum in constant time after calculating the Fibonacci numbers.\n\n4. **Handling Large Inputs**: The use of exponentiation by squaring (via the `pow` function) allows the solution to handle very large powers efficiently, which is essential given the constraints.\n\n5. **Separation of Concerns**: The solution is modular, with separate functions for calculating Fibonacci numbers, their inverses, and the final answer. This makes the code cleaner and easier to understand.\n\nIn contrast, my initial approach involved generating Fibonacci numbers up to the maximum N requested, which is inefficient for large values due to the linear time complexity of generating Fibonacci numbers. Additionally, I did not account for modular arithmetic, which is critical for handling large sums and preventing overflow.\n\nOverall, the official solution's use of advanced techniques like matrix exponentiation and modular arithmetic significantly improves both time and space complexity, making it suitable for the problem's constraints. This experience highlights the importance of optimizing algorithms for large input sizes and the value of leveraging mathematical properties in programming challenges.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: calculate_fibonacci_sum]\nThis function computes the sum of Fibonacci numbers for a series of queries, each specifying a range defined by two integers, N and K. It first determines the maximum value of N from all queries to efficiently generate Fibonacci numbers up to that limit. The Fibonacci sequence is generated and stored in a list, followed by the precomputation of cumulative sums of these Fibonacci numbers. For each query, it checks if K is greater than N and returns 0 if so; otherwise, it retrieves the precomputed sum for the first K Fibonacci numbers. Finally, the results for all queries are printed. This approach optimizes the calculation by leveraging precomputed values, ensuring efficient query responses.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge would be useful in scenarios where one needs to efficiently compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers for a large number of queries, especially when the values of N and K can be extremely large (up to 10^18). It can be applied in competitive programming contests, algorithm design, or any situation where performance optimization is critical, such as in AI systems or large-scale data processing. Understanding how to precompute values and handle large inputs efficiently is essential for developers and programmers working on performance-sensitive applications."
