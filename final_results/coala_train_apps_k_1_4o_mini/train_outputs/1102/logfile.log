[BEGIN PROBLEM]
On Miu's smart phone, there is a search feature which lets her search for a contact name by typing digits on the keypad where each digit may correspond to any of the characters given below it. For example, to search for TOM, she can type 866 and for MAX she can type 629.

Miu typed a random string of digits $S$ on the keypad while playing around, where each digit is between 2 and 9 inclusive. Now she wants to know the number of possible strings which would map to $S$. 
Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007)

-----Input:-----
- 
The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
- 
Each test case consists of a string $S$.

-----Output:-----
- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the count of all possible strings mod 1,000,000,007

-----Constraints-----
- 
1 <= $T$ <= 10
- 
1 <= $|S|$ <= 105

-----Subtasks-----

-----Sample Output:-----

12  

-----EXPLANATION:-----
- 
Example Case 1:

On the key 5, we have the character set JKL.

Hence the possible strings are J,K,L.

Hence the answer is 3 % (1000000007) = 3.  
- 
Example Case 2:
On key 7, we have the character set PQRS.

On key 2, we have the character set ABC.

Hence the possible strings are PA,PB,PC,QA,QB,QC,RA,RB,RC,SA,SB,SC.

Hence the answer is 12 % (1000000007) = 12.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Miu has a smartphone keypad where each digit from 2 to 9 corresponds to a set of letters. Given a string of digits, we need to determine how many different combinations of letters can be formed using those digits. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Each digit corresponds to a specific number of letters:
     - 2 -> ABC (3 letters)
     - 3 -> DEF (3 letters)
     - 4 -> GHI (3 letters)
     - 5 -> JKL (3 letters)
     - 6 -> MNO (3 letters)
     - 7 -> PQRS (4 letters)
     - 8 -> TUV (3 letters)
     - 9 -> WXYZ (4 letters)
   - For each digit in the input string, we can find out how many letters it corresponds to.
   - The total number of combinations can be calculated by multiplying the number of letters for each digit together.
   - Since the result can be large, we will take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define a function count_combinations(S):
       Initialize a dictionary mapping digits to their letter counts
       Initialize result to 1
       For each character in S:
           Convert character to integer
           Multiply result by the number of letters corresponding to that digit
           Take result modulo 1000000007
       Return result

   Read integer T from input
   For i from 0 to T-1:
       Read string S from input
       Print count_combinations(S)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def count_combinations(S):
    # Mapping of digits to the number of corresponding letters
    digit_to_count = {
        '2': 3,  # ABC
        '3': 3,  # DEF

        '8': 3,  # TUV
        '9': 4   # WXYZ
    }
    
    result = 1
    MOD = 1000000007
    
    # Calculate the total combinations
    for char in S:
        result = (result * digit_to_count[char]) % MOD
    
    return result

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    S = input().strip()  # Read the string of digits
    print(count_combinations(S))  # Output the result for each test case

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to calculate the number of valid schedules for serving dishes over \(N\) days, ensuring that consecutive dishes are different and that the first and last dishes are also different. The key concepts involved combinatorial counting and modular arithmetic due to potentially large results.

    Initially, I implemented a formula for \(N \geq 4\) that incorrectly included an extra multiplication factor, leading to incorrect results. The correct approach should have been to calculate the number of ways to choose the first dish (4 options), the second dish (3 options), and then for the middle dishes, allowing repetitions of the 4 dishes, while ensuring the last dish is different from the first.

    The correct formula for \(N \geq 4\) is:
    \[
    \text{result} = (4 \times 3 \times 4^{(N - 2)}) \mod (10^9 + 7)
    \]
    This accounts for the first dish, the second dish, and the choices for the remaining days, ensuring the last dish is different from the first.

    The final code implementation correctly handles the input and computes the results based on the derived formulas. Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def calculate_schedules(T, test_cases):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7  # Define the modulo constant
        for N in test_cases:
            if N == 2:
                result = 12  # For 2 days, there are 12 valid schedules
            elif N == 3:
                result = 24  # For 3 days, there are 24 valid schedules
            else:
                result = (4 * 3 * pow(4, N - 2, MOD)) % MOD
            print(result)

    # Read input
    T = int(input())  # Number of test cases
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())  # Number of days for the schedule
        test_cases.append(N)  # Store the number of days

    # Call the function with the input data
    calculate_schedules(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering constraints and ensuring that all conditions are met in combinatorial problems.

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Miu has a smartphone keypad where each digit from 2 to 9 corresponds to a set of letters. When she types a string of digits, we need to determine how many different combinations of letters can be formed based on the digits she typed. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   Each digit corresponds to a specific number of letters:
   - 2 -> 3 letters (A, B, C)
   - 3 -> 3 letters (D, E, F)
   - 4 -> 3 letters (G, H, I)
   - 5 -> 3 letters (J, K, L)
   - 6 -> 3 letters (M, N, O)
   - 7 -> 4 letters (P, Q, R, S)
   - 8 -> 3 letters (T, U, V)
   - 9 -> 4 letters (W, X, Y, Z)

   To find the total number of combinations for a given string of digits, we can multiply the number of letters corresponding to each digit. For example, if the input is "72", we would calculate \(4 \times 3\) (since 7 corresponds to 4 letters and 2 corresponds to 3 letters).

Miu typed a random string of digits $S$ on the keypad while playing around, where each digit is between 2 and 9 inclusive. Now she wants to know the number of possible strings which would map to $S$. 
Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007)

-----Input:-----
- 
The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
- 
Each test case consists of a string $S$.

-----Output:-----
- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the count of all possible strings mod 1,000,000,007

-----Constraints-----
- 
1 <= $T$ <= 10
- 
1 <= $|S|$ <= 105

Example Case 1:

On the key 5, we have the character set JKL.

Hence the possible strings are J,K,L.

Hence the answer is 3 % (1000000007) = 3.  
- 
Example Case 2:
On key 7, we have the character set PQRS.

On key 2, we have the character set ABC.

Hence the possible strings are PA,PB,PC,QA,QB,QC,RA,RB,RC,SA,SB,SC.

Hence the answer is 12 % (1000000007) = 12.

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Miu has a smartphone keypad where each digit from 2 to 9 corresponds to a set of letters. When she types a string of digits, we need to determine how many different combinations of letters can be formed based on the digits she typed. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   Each digit corresponds to a specific number of letters:
   - 2 -> 3 letters (A, B, C)
   - 3 -> 3 letters (D, E, F)
   - 4 -> 3 letters (G, H, I)
   - 5 -> 3 letters (J, K, L)
   - 6 -> 3 letters (M, N, O)
   - 7 -> 4 letters (P, Q, R, S)
   - 8 -> 3 letters (T, U, V)
   - 9 -> 4 letters (W, X, Y, Z)

   To find the total number of combinations for a given string of digits, we can multiply the number of letters corresponding to each digit. For example, if the input is "72", we would calculate \(4 \times 3\) (since 7 corresponds to 4 letters and 2 corresponds to 3 letters).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_combinations(S):
       define MOD = 1000000007
       define letter_count = {

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine the number of possible letter combinations that can be formed from a string of digits typed on a smartphone keypad. Each digit from 2 to 9 corresponds to a specific number of letters, and the solution involved multiplying the counts of letters for each digit in the input string.

The core concept tested was the mapping of digits to their respective letter counts and the use of modular arithmetic to handle potentially large numbers. The solution effectively utilized a dictionary to store the letter counts for each digit, allowing for efficient lookups during the calculation.

The implemented strategy was straightforward: iterate through each character in the input string, multiply the corresponding letter counts, and apply the modulo operation to keep the result manageable. This approach worked well, and the code passed all test cases without errors.

Key code snippet:
```python
def count_combinations(S):
    MOD = 1000000007
    letter_count = {
        '2': 3,
        '3': 3,
        '4': 3,
        '5': 3,
        '6': 3,
        '7': 4,
        '8': 3,
        '9': 4
    }
    
    result = 1
    for char in S:
        result = (result * letter_count[char]) % MOD
    
    return result
```

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding mappings and modular arithmetic in combinatorial problems.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.

- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution

   n/=10
  else:
   n/=10
 if(ans==1):
  print("0")
 else:
  print(ans %(1000000007))


INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem by iterating through each digit of the input number and calculating the number of corresponding letters based on the digit's value. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Digit Processing**: The solution processes each digit of the input number by using modulo and division operations. This allows it to handle the number as a whole rather than converting it to a string, which can be more efficient in terms of space and time complexity.

2. **Mapping Digits to Letter Counts**: The solution uses a simple conditional structure to determine the number of letters corresponding to each digit:
   - Digits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 correspond to 3 letters.
   - Digits 7 and 9 correspond to 4 letters.
   - Digit 1 corresponds to 1 letter.
   - Digit 0 is ignored.

3. **Multiplicative Accumulation**: The result is accumulated by multiplying the counts of letters for each digit and taking the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step to prevent overflow and ensure the result remains manageable.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: The solution checks if the final answer is 1, which indicates that no valid combinations were found (e.g., if the input was only zeros). It then prints "0" in such cases.

5. **Efficiency**: The approach is efficient, as it processes each digit in constant time, leading to a linear time complexity relative to the number of digits in the input.

Overall, the official solution is concise and leverages basic arithmetic operations effectively, making it a robust approach to solving the problem. My initial solution was similar in logic but used string manipulation, which could be less efficient for larger inputs. The official solution's method of directly manipulating the number is a valuable insight for future problems involving digit processing.
