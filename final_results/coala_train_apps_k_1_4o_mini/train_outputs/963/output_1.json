The key is to ensure that we only count the necessary reservoirs while avoiding double counting.\n\nHere\u2019s the revised code:\n\n```python\ndef min_reservoirs(hills):\n    # Initialize variables to track the maximum heights seen from both directions\n    left_max = -1\n    right_max = -1\n    reservoirs = 0\n    \n    # Create a list to track if a hill is covered\n    covered = [False] * len(hills)\n    \n    # First pass: from left to right\n    for i in range(len(hills)):\n        if hills[i] > left_max:\n            left_max = hills[i]\n            covered[i] = True  # This hill is covered by a reservoir\n            reservoirs += 1  # We need a reservoir here\n    \n    # Second pass: from right to left\n    for i in range(len(hills) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if hills[i] > right_max:\n            right_max = hills[i]\n            if not covered[i]:  # Only count if this hill is not already covered\n                reservoirs += 1  # We need a reservoir here\n    \n    return reservoirs\n\n# Read number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    # Read number of hills\n    N = int(input())\n    # Read heights of the hills\n    heights = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    # Print the minimum number of reservoirs needed\n    print(min_reservoirs(heights))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize `left_max` and `right_max` to keep track of the maximum heights seen from the left and right, respectively. We also initialize a `covered` list to track which hills have been covered by a reservoir.\n\n2. **First Pass (Left to Right)**: We iterate through the hills from left to right. Whenever we find a hill that is taller than `left_max`, we place a reservoir there, mark that hill as covered, and update `left_max`.\n\n3. **Second Pass (Right to Left)**: We iterate through the hills from right to left. If we find a hill taller than `right_max` that hasn't been covered yet, we place a reservoir there and update `right_max`.\n\n4. **Output**: Finally, we print the total number of reservoirs needed for each test case.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of reservoirs required to supply water to all hills without double counting.",
