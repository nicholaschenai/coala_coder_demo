    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   We have a series of hills, each with a unique height. We need to determine the minimum number of water reservoirs required to supply water to all the hills. Water can flow from a reservoir in one direction until it reaches a taller hill, which means we can strategically place reservoirs to cover as many hills as possible.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of hills and determine the optimal placement of reservoirs. We can keep track of the highest hill encountered so far as we move from left to right and from right to left. If a hill is taller than the highest hill we've seen in the current direction, we will need to place a reservoir there. By doing this in both directions, we can ensure that all hills are supplied with water while minimizing the number of reservoirs.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function min_reservoirs(hills):\n       left_max = -1\n       right_max = -1\n       reservoirs = 0\n       \n       for each hill from left to right:\n           if hill height > left_max:\n               left_max = hill height\n               reservoirs += 1\n       \n       for each hill from right to left:\n           if hill height > right_max:\n               right_max = hill height\n               reservoirs += 1\n       \n       return reservoirs\n       \n   read number of test cases T\n   for each test case:\n       read N\n       read heights of hills\n       print min_reservoirs(heights)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef min_reservoirs(hills):\n    # Initialize variables to track the maximum heights seen from both directions\n    left_max = -1\n    right_max = -1\n    reservoirs = 0\n    \n    # First pass: from left to right\n    for height in hills:\n        if height > left_max:\n            left_max = height\n            reservoirs += 1  # We need a reservoir here\n    \n    # Second pass: from right to left\n    for height in reversed(hills):\n        if height > right_max:\n            right_max = height\n            reservoirs += 1  # We need a reservoir here\n    \n    return reservoirs\n\n# Read number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    # Read number of hills\n    N = int(input())\n    # Read heights of the hills\n    heights = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    # Print the minimum number of reservoirs needed\n    print(min_reservoirs(heights))\n```",
