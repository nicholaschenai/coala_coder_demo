    "summary": "In attempting to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of reservoirs needed to supply water to a series of hills, I initially misunderstood the requirement for counting reservoirs. The key concept is that water flows from a reservoir until it reaches a taller hill, and we can choose the direction of flow. The challenge lies in optimally placing reservoirs to minimize their number while ensuring all hills receive water.\n\nMy initial approach involved counting reservoirs in both left-to-right and right-to-left passes independently, which led to overcounting. I also attempted to track covered hills but did not implement it correctly, resulting in incorrect outputs. The main error was not recognizing that a single reservoir could potentially cover multiple hills in one direction.\n\nThe correct strategy involves a single pass from left to right to place reservoirs where necessary based on the maximum height seen so far. A second pass from right to left should only count reservoirs if they are not already covered by the first pass. However, I failed to implement this correctly in my attempts, leading to incorrect outputs.\n\nThe final solution should focus on ensuring that reservoirs are only counted when they are necessary and not double-counted. The correct implementation should efficiently determine the minimum number of reservoirs required without unnecessary complexity. \n\nHere\u2019s a simplified version of the correct approach:\n\n```python\ndef min_reservoirs(hills):\n    left_max = -1\n    right_max = -1\n    reservoirs = 0\n    \n    # First pass: from left to right\n    for height in hills:\n        if height > left_max:\n            left_max = height\n            reservoirs += 1  # Place a reservoir here\n    \n    # Second pass: from right to left\n    for height in reversed(hills):\n        if height > right_max:\n            right_max = height\n            reservoirs += 1  # Place a reservoir here\n    \n    return reservoirs\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of reservoirs required to supply water to all hills without double counting.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\nIn my attempts to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of reservoirs needed for the hills, I initially focused on a two-pass approach, where I tracked the maximum heights from both the left and right sides. However, this approach led to overcounting reservoirs because I did not effectively manage the coverage of hills by reservoirs placed in either direction. My logic failed to account for the fact that a single reservoir could potentially cover multiple hills, leading to an inflated count.\n\nThe official solution takes a different approach by leveraging recursion. It identifies the peak hill (the highest hill) and uses it as a reference point. If the peak is at either end of the list, only one reservoir is needed. If the peak is in the middle, the solution recursively calculates the minimum reservoirs needed for the left and right segments of the list, adding one for the peak itself. This method effectively reduces the problem size with each recursive call, ensuring that all hills are accounted for without unnecessary duplication.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n1. **Peak Identification**: The solution identifies the highest hill as a natural dividing point for the problem.\n2. **Recursive Breakdown**: It recursively solves the problem for the segments of hills on either side of the peak, which simplifies the problem significantly.\n3. **Base Cases**: The solution includes clear base cases for when the peak is at the ends of the list, ensuring efficient handling of edge cases.\n\nThis experience highlights the importance of considering different problem-solving strategies, particularly recursive approaches, which can simplify complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts.",
