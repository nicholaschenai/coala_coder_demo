    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to determine the minimum cost to travel on specific days of the year using train tickets that can be purchased in three different durations: a 1-day pass, a 7-day pass, and a 30-day pass. Each type of pass has a different cost, and we want to find the least amount of money spent to cover all the travel days.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. We will create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to cover travel up to the `i-th` day in the `days` array. For each travel day, we will consider the cost of buying each type of pass (1-day, 7-day, and 30-day) and update the `dp` array accordingly. The final answer will be the value in `dp` corresponding to the last travel day.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Initialize a dp array of size 366 (to cover days 1 to 365) with infinity\n   Set dp[0] = 0 (no cost for day 0)\n   For each day in the days array:\n       For each type of pass (1-day, 7-day, 30-day):\n           Calculate the cost if the pass is bought on the current day\n           Update the dp array with the minimum cost\n   Return dp[last_day] as the result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def mincostTickets(self, days: list[int], costs: list[int]) -> int:\n        # Initialize a dp array of size 366 (to cover days 1 to 365)\n        dp = [float('inf')] * 366\n        dp[0] = 0  # No cost for day 0\n\n        # Iterate through each travel day\n        for day in days:\n            # Calculate the minimum cost for each type of pass\n            dp[day] = min(dp[day], dp[day - 1] + costs[0])  # 1-day pass\n            dp[day] = min(dp[day], dp[max(0, day - 7)] + costs[1])  # 7-day pass\n            dp[day] = min(dp[day], dp[max(0, day - 30)] + costs[2])  # 30-day pass\n\n        # The answer is the minimum cost to cover all travel days\n        return dp[days[-1]]\n```",
