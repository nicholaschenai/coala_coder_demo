This data structure holds information about array of N elements and can process two types of operations:\n\n- Add some value to ith element of the array\n- Calculate sum of all elements on any prefix of the array\n\nBoth operations take O(log N) time. This data structure is also well known for its low memory usage. To be more precise, it needs exactly the same amount of memory as that of array.\n\nGiven some array A, first we build data structure in some other array T. Ti stores the sum of the elements Astart, Astart + 1, ..., Ai. Index start is calculated with formula start = Fdown(i) = (i & (i + 1)). Here \"&\" denotes bitwise AND operation.\nSo, in order to find a sum of elements A0, A1, ..., AL you start with index L and calculate sum of TL + TFdown(L)-1 + TFdown(Fdown(L)-1)-1 + ... + TFdown(Fdown(...(Fdown(L)-1)-1)-1. Usually it is performed with cycle that goes from L down to 0 with function Fdown and sums some elements from T. Chef wants to verify that the time complexity to calculate sum of A0, A1, A2, ..., AL is O(log L). In order to do so, he wonders how many times he has to access array T to calculate this sum. Help him to find this out.\nSince Chef works with really big indices. The value of L can be very large and is provided to you in binary representation as concatenation of strings L1, L2 repeated N times and string L3.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains three non-empty strings L1, L2, L3 and an integer N. Strings will contain only characters 0 and 1. To obtain binary representation of index L concatenate L1 with L2 repeated N times and with L3. You are guaranteed that the index will be positive.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, output a single line containing number of times Fenwick tree data structure will access array T in order to compute sum of A0, A1, A2, ..., AL.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 300\n- 1 \u2264 Length(Li) \u2264 1000\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 106\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask #1 (20 points): |L1| + |L2| * N + |L3| \u2264 60\n- Subtask #2 (30 points): 1 \u2264 T \u2264 30, 1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\n- Subtask #3 (50 points): No additional constraints\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n4\n001 100 011 4\n1000 1101 100 3\n1010 001 101 4\n010 101 000 4\n\nOutput:\n6\n12\n8\n10\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code might be going wrong.\n\n1. **Understanding the Fdown Function:**\n   The function `Fdown(i)` is defined as `i & (i + 1)`. This function is supposed to help us find the next index to access in the Fenwick tree. However, the way we are using it in the `count_accesses` function might not be correct. Specifically, we need to ensure that we are correctly decrementing L before applying Fdown.\n\n2. **Counting Accesses:**\n   The logic for counting accesses is based on repeatedly applying `Fdown` until we reach 0. However, the way we are decrementing L before applying Fdown might be incorrect. We should be applying Fdown directly to L without decrementing it first.\n\n3. **Binary String to Integer Conversion:**\n   The conversion of the binary string to an integer seems correct, but we need to ensure that the concatenation of L1, L2 repeated N times, and L3 is done properly.\n\n4. **Expected Output:**\n   The expected output for the test cases indicates that the number of accesses is higher than what our code is producing. This suggests that we are not correctly counting the number of times we access the Fenwick tree.\n\n### Where I Went Wrong:\n- The decrementing of L before applying Fdown is likely causing the count to be off. Instead of decrementing L, we should directly apply Fdown to L and count the accesses until L becomes 0.\n- The logic for counting accesses should be carefully checked to ensure that we are not missing any accesses.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. Construct L correctly from the binary strings.\n2. Apply Fdown directly to L without decrementing it first.\n3. Count the number of accesses until L reaches 0.\n\nNow, let's implement the corrected logic in the code. \n\n```python\ndef Fdown(i):\n    # Function to calculate Fdown(i) = i & (i + 1)\n    return (i & (i + 1))\n\ndef count_accesses(L):\n    # Function to count the number of accesses to the Fenwick tree\n    count = 0\n    while L > 0:\n        L = Fdown(L)  # Update L using Fdown without decrementing\n        count += 1  # Increment the access count\n    return count\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    # Read the binary strings and the integer N\n    L1, L2, L3, N = input().split()\n    N = int(N)\n    \n    # Construct the binary representation of L\n    L = L1 + (L2 * N) + L3\n    \n    # Convert the binary string to an integer\n    L = int(L, 2)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of accesses and print the result\n    result = count_accesses(L)\n    print(result)\n``` \n\nThis revised code should correctly count the number of accesses to the Fenwick tree based on the provided input."

        "content": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step to identify the issues in the code and understand why it is not passing the tests.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements:**\n   The problem requires us to count how many times we access the Fenwick tree to compute the sum from A0 to AL. The access count is determined by repeatedly applying the `Fdown` function until we reach 0.\n\n2. **Reviewing the Fdown Function:**\n   The `Fdown` function is defined correctly as `i & (i + 1)`. However, we need to ensure that we are applying it correctly in the context of counting accesses.\n\n3. **Counting Accesses Logic:**\n   The logic in the `count_accesses` function should be correct in terms of counting how many times we can apply `Fdown` until L becomes 0. However, we need to ensure that we are not missing any accesses or incorrectly applying the function.\n\n4. **Potential Issues:**\n   - The way we are constructing L from the binary strings might be leading to an unexpectedly large number, which could cause the loop in `count_accesses` to run for too long or even lead to a runtime error.\n   - The concatenation of L1, L2 repeated N times, and L3 could create a very long binary string, especially when N is large (up to 1,000,000). This could lead to performance issues.\n\n5. **Optimization Consideration:**\n   Instead of constructing the entire binary string for L, we can calculate the length of L directly and then convert it to an integer without creating a massive string. This will help avoid performance issues.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. Calculate the length of L based on the lengths of L1, L2, and L3, and the repetition factor N.\n2. Use the binary representation directly to compute the integer value of L.\n3. Count the accesses using the `Fdown` function.\n\nNow, let's implement the corrected logic in the code:\n\n```python\ndef Fdown(i):\n    # Function to calculate Fdown(i) = i & (i + 1)\n    return (i & (i + 1))\n\ndef count_accesses(L):\n    # Function to count the number of accesses to the Fenwick tree\n    count = 0\n    while L > 0:\n        L = Fdown(L)  # Update L using Fdown\n        count += 1  # Increment the access count\n    return count\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    # Read the binary strings and the integer N\n    L1, L2, L3, N = input().split()\n    N = int(N)\n    \n    # Calculate the length of the binary representation of L\n    L_length = len(L1) + len(L2) * N + len(L3)\n    \n    # Construct the binary representation of L\n    # Instead of creating a massive string, we can calculate the integer directly\n    L = int(L1, 2)  # Start with L1\n    L <<= (len(L2) * N)  # Shift left by the length of L2 repeated N times\n    L += int(L2 * N, 2)  # Add the value of L2 repeated N times\n    L <<= len(L3)  # Shift left by the length of L3\n    L += int(L3, 2)  # Add the value of L3\n    \n    # Calculate the number of accesses and print the result\n    result = count_accesses(L)\n    print(result)\n```\n\nThis code should now correctly handle the construction of L and count the accesses without running into performance issues."

        "content": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step to identify the issues in the code and understand why it is not passing the tests.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem Requirements:**\n   The problem requires us to count how many times we access the Fenwick tree to compute the sum from A0 to AL. The access count is determined by repeatedly applying the `Fdown` function until we reach 0.\n\n2. **Reviewing the Fdown Function:**\n   The `Fdown` function is defined correctly as `i & (i + 1)`. This function is supposed to help us find the next index to access in the Fenwick tree. \n\n3. **Counting Accesses Logic:**\n   The logic in the `count_accesses` function should be correct in terms of counting how many times we can apply `Fdown` until L becomes 0. However, we need to ensure that we are not missing any accesses or incorrectly applying the function.\n\n4. **Potential Issues:**\n   - The way we are constructing L from the binary strings might be leading to an unexpectedly large number, which could cause the loop in `count_accesses` to run for too long or even lead to a runtime error.\n   - The concatenation of L1, L2 repeated N times, and L3 could create a very long binary string, especially when N is large (up to 1,000,000). This could lead to performance issues.\n\n5. **Revisiting the Construction of L:**\n   The previous approach to construct L by shifting and adding might not be correct. Instead, we should construct the binary string directly and then convert it to an integer.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. Construct the binary representation of L by concatenating L1, L2 repeated N times, and L3.\n2. Convert the entire binary string to an integer.\n3. Count the accesses using the `Fdown` function.\n\nNow, let's implement the corrected logic in the code:\n\n```python\ndef Fdown(i):\n    # Function to calculate Fdown(i) = i & (i + 1)\n    return (i & (i + 1))\n\ndef count_accesses(L):\n    # Function to count the number of accesses to the Fenwick tree\n    count = 0\n    while L > 0:\n        L = Fdown(L)  # Update L using Fdown\n        count += 1  # Increment the access count\n    return count\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    # Read the binary strings and the integer N\n    L1, L2, L3, N = input().split()\n    N = int(N)\n    \n    # Construct the binary representation of L\n    L = L1 + (L2 * N) + L3\n    \n    # Convert the binary string to an integer\n    L = int(L, 2)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of accesses and print the result\n    result = count_accesses(L)\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Direct Construction of L:** The code now constructs L by concatenating L1, L2 repeated N times, and L3, and then converting the entire binary string to an integer.\n2. **Correct Application of Fdown:** The counting of accesses is done correctly by applying `Fdown` directly to L without decrementing it first.\n\nThis implementation should now correctly handle the input and output requirements while efficiently counting the accesses to the Fenwick tree."

The series is generated by the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\n    \\[ T(N) = \\frac{(N-1) \\cdot N \\cdot (2(N-1) + 1)}{6} \\]\n\n    This formula derives from the known formula for the sum of the first k squares.\n\n    The initial approach incorrectly used a different formula, resulting in outputs that did not match the expected results. After analyzing the series and identifying the correct pattern, I revised the code to implement the correct formula, which successfully passed all test cases.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_nth_number(N):\n        if N == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            return ((N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1)) // 6\n\n    T = int(input())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        result = find_nth_number(N)\n        print(result)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring the correct mathematical formulas are applied.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

However, my approach encountered issues primarily due to the inefficient handling of large binary strings, especially when N was large.

This avoids the overhead of creating large intermediate strings, which was a significant flaw in my approach. The official solution also correctly implements the access counting by using the expression `(d & (d + 1)) - 1`, which efficiently computes the next index to access in the Fenwick tree.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n1. **Direct Binary Construction:** The official solution constructs L directly from the input strings without creating large intermediate representations, which is crucial for performance.\n2. **Efficient Access Counting:** The use of bitwise operations to count accesses is both concise and efficient, ensuring that the solution runs within time limits even for large inputs.\n\nOverall, the official solution's approach to handling binary strings and counting accesses is more efficient and straightforward than my initial attempts, highlighting the importance of considering performance implications when dealing with potentially large data."
