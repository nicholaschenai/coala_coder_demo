    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The problem involves calculating how many times a Fenwick tree (or Binary Indexed Tree) accesses its internal array T to compute the sum of elements from an array A, given a large index L. The index L is constructed from three binary strings and a repetition factor. The goal is to determine the number of accesses required for each test case.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve the problem, we need to:\n   - Construct the binary representation of L by concatenating L1, L2 repeated N times, and L3.\n   - Convert this binary string into an integer to get the value of L.\n   - Calculate how many times we need to access the Fenwick tree to compute the sum from A0 to AL. This is done by repeatedly applying the function Fdown, which is defined as `Fdown(i) = (i & (i + 1))`, until we reach 0. Each application of Fdown corresponds to one access to the array T.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function Fdown(i):\n       return (i & (i + 1))\n\n   function count_accesses(L):\n       count = 0\n       while L > 0:\n           L = Fdown(L - 1)\n           count += 1\n       return count\n\n   read T\n   for each test case:\n       read L1, L2, L3, N\n       construct L by concatenating L1, L2 repeated N times, and L3\n       convert L from binary string to integer\n       result = count_accesses(L)\n       print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef Fdown(i):\n    # Function to calculate Fdown(i) = i & (i + 1)\n    return (i & (i + 1))\n\ndef count_accesses(L):\n    # Function to count the number of accesses to the Fenwick tree\n    count = 0\n    while L > 0:\n        L = Fdown(L - 1)  # Update L using Fdown\n        count += 1  # Increment the access count\n    return count\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    # Read the binary strings and the integer N\n    L1, L2, L3, N = input().split()\n    N = int(N)\n    \n    # Construct the binary representation of L\n    L = L1 + (L2 * N) + L3\n    \n    # Convert the binary string to an integer\n    L = int(L, 2)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of accesses and print the result\n    result = count_accesses(L)\n    print(result)\n```",
