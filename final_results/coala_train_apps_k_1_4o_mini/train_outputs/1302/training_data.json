    "summary": "### Summary of Attempts\n\nThe problem involved distributing tiles from boxes to tile rooms in two houses, ensuring that the same number of tiles from a box is used for two rooms. Each box `i` contains `i` tiles, and each room `i` requires `i*i` tiles to be completely tiled.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n1. The number of tiles in box `i` must be even to tile two rooms completely.\n2. The area of the rooms corresponds to perfect squares, meaning we need to find the largest integer `k` such that `k^2 <= N`.\n3. The total number of rooms that can be tiled is `2 * k`, as each perfect square can tile two rooms (one in each house).\n\n**Mistakes Made:**\n- Initially, I miscalculated the number of rooms that could be tiled by simply counting even boxes and multiplying by 2, which did not consider the actual area requirements of the rooms.\n- I repeatedly returned `2 * k` without properly validating the conditions under which rooms could be tiled.\n\n**Final Correct Approach:**\nThe correct solution involves calculating `k` as `int(N**0.5)` to find the largest perfect square less than or equal to `N`, and then returning `2 * k` for the total number of rooms that can be tiled.\n\n**Final Code Snippet:**\n```python\ndef count_tiled_rooms(N):\n    k = int(N**0.5)  # Largest k such that k^2 <= N\n    return 2 * k  # Each k can tile two rooms\n\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())\n    result = count_tiled_rooms(N)\n    print(result)\n```\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the problem constraints and requirements, particularly when dealing with mathematical relationships in programming challenges.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\nIn my attempts to solve the problem, I initially misunderstood the requirements regarding how tiles from the boxes could be used to tile the rooms. My approach focused on calculating the largest integer `k` such that `k^2 <= N`, which led to incorrect conclusions about the number of rooms that could be tiled. Specifically, I mistakenly multiplied `k` by 2 without properly accounting for how the tiles from the boxes could be distributed between the two houses.\n\nThe official solution provided a more straightforward approach. It correctly identifies that to tile two rooms completely, we can only use boxes with an even number of tiles. By dividing `N` by 2, the solution effectively counts how many boxes can be used to tile rooms. The key insight is that the number of rooms that can be tiled is directly related to the largest integer `k` such that `k^2` is less than or equal to `N/2`, which is then multiplied by 2 to account for both houses.\n\nThe official solution is efficient and concise, leveraging integer division and the square root function to derive the result in constant time for each test case. This highlights the importance of carefully analyzing the problem constraints and requirements before implementing a solution. \n\n### Key Takeaways:\n- Always ensure a clear understanding of how resources (in this case, tiles) can be utilized based on the problem constraints.\n- Simplifying the problem by breaking it down into smaller parts (like considering only even boxes) can lead to a more efficient solution.\n- The official solution's approach of using `n //= 2` and then calculating `k` as `2 * int(n**0.5)` is a clear and effective method to arrive at the correct answer.",
