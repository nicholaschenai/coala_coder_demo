    "raw_msg": "Thank you for your patience. Let's revisit the problem and ensure we derive the correct solution based on the requirements.\n\n### Problem Recap:\nThe Chef has `N` boxes of tiles, where the `i-th` box contains `i` tiles. Each house has `N` rooms, and the area of the `i-th` room is `i*i`, meaning it requires `i*i` tiles to tile it completely. We need to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes, ensuring that the same number of tiles from a box is used for two rooms (one in each house).\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. Each box `i` can only be used if it can tile two rooms completely.\n2. The number of tiles in box `i` is `i`, and to tile two rooms, we need to ensure that the area of the rooms can be tiled with the tiles from the boxes.\n3. The rooms that can be tiled completely correspond to perfect squares, as the area of the `i-th` room is `i*i`.\n\n### Correct Approach:\n- We need to find the largest integer `k` such that `k^2 <= N`. This `k` represents the maximum room number that can be tiled completely.\n- The total number of rooms that can be tiled will be `2 * k` (since there are two houses).\n\n### Final Corrected Solution:\nHere is the corrected Python code that implements the above logic:\n\n```python\n# Function to count the total number of rooms that can be tiled completely\ndef count_tiled_rooms(N):\n    # Find the largest integer k such that k^2 <= N\n    k = int(N**0.5)  # This gives us the largest k where k^2 is a perfect square <= N\n    return 2 * k  # Each k can tile two rooms (one in each house)\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())  # Read the value of N for each test case\n    result = count_tiled_rooms(N)  # Calculate the result\n    print(result)  # Output the result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `count_tiled_rooms(N)` calculates the largest integer `k` such that `k^2 <= N` using `int(N**0.5)`. This gives us the number of perfect squares up to `N`.\n- The total number of rooms that can be tiled is `2 * k`, as each perfect square can tile two rooms (one in each house).\n- The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each value of `N`, printing the result for each case.\n\nThis solution should now correctly count the total number of rooms that can be tiled completely for the given constraints.",
