    "raw_msg": "Based on the insights gained from the problem and the previous mistakes, I will revise the solution to correctly count the total number of rooms that can be tiled completely using the tiles from the boxes. \n\nThe key points to consider are:\n- Each box `i` contains `i` tiles.\n- To tile two rooms completely, we need to ensure that the number of tiles used is even and that the area of the rooms can be tiled with the tiles from the boxes.\n\nThe correct approach is to iterate through the boxes and check how many rooms can be tiled based on the number of tiles in each box. Specifically, we can only use boxes with an even number of tiles, and each such box can tile two rooms.\n\nHere is the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\n# Function to count the total number of rooms that can be tiled completely\ndef count_tiled_rooms(N):\n    # The number of rooms that can be tiled is equal to the number of even boxes\n    # Each even box can tile two rooms\n    return (N // 2) * 2  # Count of even numbers from 1 to N, multiplied by 2 for two rooms\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())  # Read the value of N for each test case\n    result = count_tiled_rooms(N)  # Calculate the result\n    print(result)  # Output the result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `count_tiled_rooms(N)` calculates how many even numbers are there from `1` to `N` using integer division `N // 2`. Each even box can tile two rooms, so we multiply the count of even boxes by `2`.\n- The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each value of `N`, printing the result for each case. \n\nThis solution should now correctly count the total number of rooms that can be tiled completely for the given constraints.",
