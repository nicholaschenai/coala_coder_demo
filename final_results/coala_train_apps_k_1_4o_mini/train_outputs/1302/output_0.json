    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The Chef has a number of boxes, each containing a number of tiles equal to the box number (1 tile in box 1, 2 tiles in box 2, etc.). He has two houses, each with rooms that have square floors. The goal is to determine how many rooms in both houses can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes, ensuring that the same number of tiles from a box is used for two rooms (one in each house) and that each room is tiled completely from a single box.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   For each box `i`, the number of tiles is `i`. To tile two rooms completely, we need to ensure that the number of tiles used is even (since we need to use the same number of tiles in both rooms). Therefore, we can only use boxes with an even number of tiles. The maximum room number that can be tiled completely is determined by the largest perfect square less than or equal to `N`. The number of rooms that can be tiled is equal to the largest integer `k` such that `k^2 <= N`. The total number of rooms tiled will be `2 * k` (since there are two houses).\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_tiled_rooms(N):\n       k = floor(sqrt(N))  // Find the largest integer k such that k^2 <= N\n       return 2 * k  // Each k can tile two rooms (one in each house)\n\n   read T  // Number of test cases\n   for each test case:\n       read N\n       result = count_tiled_rooms(N)\n       print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Function to count the total number of rooms that can be tiled completely\ndef count_tiled_rooms(N):\n    k = int(math.isqrt(N))  # Find the largest integer k such that k^2 <= N\n    return 2 * k  # Each k can tile two rooms (one in each house)\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())  # Read the value of N for each test case\n    result = count_tiled_rooms(N)  # Calculate the result\n    print(result)  # Output the result\n```",
