    "raw_msg": "Based on the insights and corrections needed from the previous attempts, I will now provide the correct solution to the problem of counting the total number of rooms that can be tiled completely using the tiles from the boxes.\n\n### Key Points to Consider:\n1. Each box `i` contains `i` tiles.\n2. To tile two rooms completely, we need to ensure that the number of tiles used is even and that the area of the rooms can be tiled with the tiles from the boxes.\n3. The area of the `i-th` room is `i*i`, which means we need to check if we can use the tiles from the boxes to tile two rooms of size `i`.\n\n### Correct Approach:\n- We need to find the largest integer `k` such that `k^2 <= N`. This `k` represents the maximum room number that can be tiled completely.\n- The total number of rooms that can be tiled will be `2 * k` (since there are two houses).\n\nHere is the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\n# Function to count the total number of rooms that can be tiled completely\ndef count_tiled_rooms(N):\n    # Find the largest integer k such that k^2 <= N\n    k = int(N**0.5)  # This gives us the largest k where k^2 is a perfect square <= N\n    return 2 * k  # Each k can tile two rooms (one in each house)\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())  # Read the value of N for each test case\n    result = count_tiled_rooms(N)  # Calculate the result\n    print(result)  # Output the result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `count_tiled_rooms(N)` calculates the largest integer `k` such that `k^2 <= N` using `int(N**0.5)`. This gives us the number of perfect squares up to `N`.\n- The total number of rooms that can be tiled is `2 * k`, as each perfect square can tile two rooms (one in each house).\n- The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each value of `N`, printing the result for each case.\n\nThis solution should now correctly count the total number of rooms that can be tiled completely for the given constraints.",
