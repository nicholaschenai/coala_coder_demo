The encoding format is `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times to repeat the `encoded_string` that follows it inside square brackets. Our task is to return the fully decoded string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To decode the string, we can use a stack to keep track of the characters and numbers as we parse through the string. When we encounter a digit, we build the number until we hit a `[`, at which point we push the number and the current string onto the stack. When we encounter a `]`, we pop from the stack to get the last number and string, repeat the string that many times, and append it to the string we are currently building. This process continues until we have processed the entire input string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Initialize an empty stack\n   Initialize an empty current_string\n   Initialize a number variable to 0\n\n   For each character in the input string:\n       If the character is a digit:\n           Update the number (build the complete number)\n       Else if the character is '[':\n           Push the current_string and the number onto the stack\n           Reset current_string and number\n       Else if the character is ']':\n           Pop the number and the last string from the stack\n           Repeat current_string the number of times and append to the last string\n           Update current_string to this new string\n       Else:\n           Append the character to current_string\n\n   Return current_string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:\n        # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of numbers and strings\n        stack = []\n        current_string = \"\"\n        number = 0\n        \n        # Iterate through each character in the input string\n        for char in s:\n            if char.isdigit():\n                # Build the number (could be more than one digit)\n                number = number * 10 + int(char)\n            elif char == '[':\n                # Push the current string and number onto the stack\n                stack.append((current_string, number))\n                # Reset current_string and number for the new segment\n                current_string = \"\"\n                number = 0\n            elif char == ']':\n                # Pop the last string and number from the stack\n                last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()\n                # Repeat the current_string and append to the last string\n                current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count\n            else:\n                # Append the character to the current_string\n                current_string += char\n        \n        # Return the fully decoded string\n        return current_string\n```"

It utilizes the `count` method to determine if \"abc\" exists and continues to replace all occurrences of it until none remain. This approach is straightforward and ensures that all instances of \"abc\" are removed in a single pass through the string.\n\n    One key insight from the official solution is the use of `s.count(\"abc\")` to check for occurrences, which is a more direct way to determine if the loop should continue. In my initial solution, I used `in` to check for the substring, which is also valid but less explicit about counting occurrences. Additionally, the official solution removes all instances of \"abc\" in one go with `s.replace(\"abc\", \"\")`, which is efficient for this problem.\n\n    Overall, the official solution is concise and leverages built-in string methods effectively. It highlights the importance of understanding the capabilities of string methods in Python, which can simplify the implementation of such problems. In future implementations, I will consider using methods like `count` for clarity and efficiency when dealing with substring occurrences.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
