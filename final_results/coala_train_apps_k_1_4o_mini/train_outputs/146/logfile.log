## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.


The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.


You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].


Examples:

s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to decode a string that contains encoded patterns. The encoding format is `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times to repeat the `encoded_string` that follows it inside square brackets. Our task is to return the fully decoded string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To decode the string, we can use a stack to keep track of the characters and numbers as we parse through the string. When we encounter a digit, we build the number until we hit a `[`, at which point we push the number and the current string onto the stack. When we encounter a `]`, we pop from the stack to get the last number and string, repeat the string that many times, and append it to the string we are currently building. This process continues until we have processed the entire input string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize an empty stack
   Initialize an empty current_string
   Initialize a number variable to 0

   For each character in the input string:
       If the character is a digit:
           Update the number (build the complete number)
       Else if the character is '[':
           Push the current_string and the number onto the stack
           Reset current_string and number
       Else if the character is ']':
           Pop the number and the last string from the stack
           Repeat current_string the number of times and append to the last string
           Update current_string to this new string
       Else:
           Append the character to current_string

   Return current_string
   ```

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by using a while loop that checks for the presence of the substring "abc" in the input string. It utilizes the `count` method to determine if "abc" exists and continues to replace all occurrences of it until none remain. This approach is straightforward and ensures that all instances of "abc" are removed in a single pass through the string.

    One key insight from the official solution is the use of `s.count("abc")` to check for occurrences, which is a more direct way to determine if the loop should continue. In my initial solution, I used `in` to check for the substring, which is also valid but less explicit about counting occurrences. Additionally, the official solution removes all instances of "abc" in one go with `s.replace("abc", "")`, which is efficient for this problem.

    Overall, the official solution is concise and leverages built-in string methods effectively. It highlights the importance of understanding the capabilities of string methods in Python, which can simplify the implementation of such problems. In future implementations, I will consider using methods like `count` for clarity and efficiency when dealing with substring occurrences.

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] The problem involved decoding a string formatted with patterns like `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times to repeat the `encoded_string`. The solution required using a stack to manage the characters and numbers as we processed the input string.

The core concept was to iterate through the string, building numbers when digits were encountered, and managing the current string and its repetitions using a stack. When encountering an opening bracket `[`, the current string and number were pushed onto the stack, and when a closing bracket `]` was found, the last string and number were popped to repeat the current string accordingly.

The implemented solution effectively handled the decoding process without any errors, and all provided test cases passed successfully. The final code utilized a straightforward approach with clear logic for handling different character types, ensuring that the decoding was performed correctly. 

Key strategies included:
- Using a stack to manage nested structures.
- Building numbers from consecutive digits.
- Concatenating strings based on the popped values from the stack.

The solution was efficient and adhered to the problem constraints, demonstrating a solid understanding of string manipulation and stack usage in Python.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.


The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.


You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].


Examples:

s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        
```

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 146 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to decode a string that contains encoded patterns. The encoding format is `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times the `encoded_string` inside the brackets should be repeated. The goal is to return the fully decoded string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To decode the string, we can use a stack to keep track of the characters and numbers as we iterate through the string. When we encounter a digit, we build the number until we hit a bracket. When we find an opening bracket `[`, we push the current number and the current string onto the stack. When we find a closing bracket `]`, we pop from the stack to get the last number and string, repeat the current string according to the number, and concatenate it back to the previous string. This process continues until we have processed the entire input string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Initialize an empty stack
   Initialize an empty current_string
   Initialize a number variable to 0

   For each character in the input string:
       If the character is a digit:
           Update the number (build the number)
       Else if the character is '[':
           Push the current_string and the number onto the stack
           Reset current_string and number
       Else if the character is ']':
           Pop the last number and string from the stack
           Repeat current_string by the number and concatenate to the last string
       Else:
           Append the character to current_string

   Return the current_string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []  # Initialize an empty stack
        current_string = ""  # Initialize an empty current string
        number = 0  # Initialize a number variable to 0

        for char in s:  # Iterate through each character in the input string
            if char.isdigit():  # If the character is a digit
                number = number * 10 + int(char)  # Build the number
            elif char == '[':  # If the character is '['
                stack.append((current_string, number))  # Push current string and number onto the stack
                current_string = ""  # Reset current string
                number = 0  # Reset number
            elif char == ']':  # If the character is ']'
                last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()  # Pop the last string and number from the stack
                current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count  # Repeat current string and concatenate
            else:  # If the character is a regular character
                current_string += char  # Append the character to current string

        return current_string  # Return the fully decoded string

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] The official solution effectively utilizes a stack to manage the decoding of the string, which is a common approach for problems involving nested structures like brackets. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Stack Initialization**: The stack is initialized with a base case of an empty string and a multiplier of 1. This allows for easy concatenation of results as we process the string.

2. **Building Numbers**: The solution builds the number as a string until it encounters a bracket. This is a crucial step to handle multi-digit numbers correctly.

3. **Handling Brackets**: When encountering an opening bracket `[`, the current string and the number are pushed onto the stack. This allows the algorithm to keep track of the context for nested structures.

4. **Decoding Logic**: Upon encountering a closing bracket `]`, the algorithm pops the last string and multiplier from the stack and appends the repeated string to the previous string in the stack. This ensures that the nested structures are resolved correctly.

5. **Final Output**: The final decoded string is obtained from the first element of the stack after processing the entire input string.

The official solution is efficient and straightforward, leveraging the stack to manage the complexity of nested encodings. My initial approach was similar but lacked the clarity in managing the stack and the number building, which could lead to potential issues with multi-digit numbers and nested structures. The official solution's handling of these aspects is more robust and concise.

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] This function decodes a string that contains encoded segments in the format of numbers followed by brackets, where the number indicates how many times the string within the brackets should be repeated. It uses a stack to keep track of the current string and the repeat count whenever it encounters an opening bracket. As it processes each character, it builds numbers for repeat counts and constructs the current string. When it encounters a closing bracket, it pops the last string and repeat count from the stack, repeats the current string accordingly, and concatenates it with the previous string. The function continues this process until all characters are processed. Finally, it returns the fully decoded string.
