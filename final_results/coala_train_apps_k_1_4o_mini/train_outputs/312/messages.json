The solution involved using dynamic programming to build an array that tracks the length of the LIS ending at each index. The core concept was to compare each element with all previous elements to determine if they could form an increasing sequence.\n\n    The implemented algorithm runs in O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for this problem. The approach involved initializing a list `d` where each element starts with a value of 1 (indicating that the minimum LIS length for any single element is 1). The nested loops then updated this list based on comparisons between elements.\n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n            n = len(nums)\n            if n == 0:\n                return 0\n            d = [1] * n\n        \n            for i in range(1, n):\n                for j in range(i):\n                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n            return max(d)\n    ```\n\n    This solution was effective and passed the provided test case, demonstrating a solid understanding of dynamic programming principles. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This method effectively reduces the time complexity compared to my initial approach, which involved nested loops to check all previous prefix sums.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Cumulative Sum**: The solution maintains a running cumulative sum (`cum_sum`) as it iterates through the array. This allows for quick calculations of subarray sums.\n\n2. **Deque for Efficient Access**: The use of a deque allows for efficient removal of elements from both ends. This is crucial for maintaining a list of potential starting points for subarrays that could meet the sum requirement.\n\n3. **Handling Positive and Negative Values**:\n   - When encountering a positive value, the solution checks if the current cumulative sum minus the front of the deque (which holds the smallest cumulative sum seen so far) meets or exceeds K. If it does, it calculates the length of the subarray and updates the result.\n   - For negative values, the solution removes any cumulative sums from the back of the deque that are greater than or equal to the current cumulative sum, as they cannot contribute to a shorter valid subarray.\n\n4. **Final Result**: The result is updated only if a valid subarray is found, ensuring that the function returns -1 if no such subarray exists.\n\n### Reflection on My Approach:\nMy initial approach was less efficient due to the nested loop structure, which resulted in a higher time complexity. The official solution's use of a deque allows it to efficiently manage potential starting points for subarrays, leading to a more optimal solution.

It initializes a variable to track the minimum length and uses a prefix sum approach to efficiently calculate the sums of subarrays. As it iterates through the list, it updates the current sum and stores it in a prefix sums list. For each new sum, it checks previous prefix sums to determine if the difference meets or exceeds K, calculating the length of the corresponding subarray. The function updates the minimum length whenever a shorter valid subarray is found. Finally, it returns the minimum length if a valid subarray exists, or -1 if none is found.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to analyze subarrays of numerical data to find the shortest segment that meets a specific sum requirement. This can be applicable in various fields such as finance for analyzing profit/loss over time, in data analysis for finding trends, or in algorithm design where optimizing for performance is crucial. It can also be beneficial in competitive programming and coding interviews where such problems are common."
