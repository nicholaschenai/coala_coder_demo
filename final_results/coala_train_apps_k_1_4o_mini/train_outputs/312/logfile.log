INFO - [Task id] 312 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray from a given list of integers such that the sum of the elements in that subarray is at least a specified value K. If no such subarray exists, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach combined with prefix sums. We will maintain a cumulative sum of the elements as we iterate through the list. For each element, we will check if the sum of any subarray ending at that element meets or exceeds K. We can use a deque to efficiently track the indices of the prefix sums that can potentially form valid subarrays. If we find a valid subarray, we will update the minimum length found so far.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize a variable to store the prefix sum and a deque to store indices of prefix sums
   Initialize a variable to store the minimum length of the subarray found (set to infinity)
   Iterate through the array:
       Update the prefix sum with the current element
       While the deque is not empty and the prefix sum minus the prefix sum at the front of the deque is at least K:
           Calculate the length of the subarray and update the minimum length if it's shorter
           Remove the front of the deque
       Append the current index to the deque
   If the minimum length is still infinity, return -1
   Otherwise, return the minimum length
   ```

[Summary]:
    The task was to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted array of integers. The solution involved using dynamic programming to build an array that tracks the length of the LIS ending at each index. The core concept was to compare each element with all previous elements to determine if they could form an increasing sequence.

    The implemented algorithm runs in O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for this problem. The approach involved initializing a list `d` where each element starts with a value of 1 (indicating that the minimum LIS length for any single element is 1). The nested loops then updated this list based on comparisons between elements.

    The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
            n = len(nums)
            if n == 0:
                return 0
            d = [1] * n
        
            for i in range(1, n):
                for j in range(i):
                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
        
            return max(d)
    ```

    This solution was effective and passed the provided test case, demonstrating a solid understanding of dynamic programming principles. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation.

INFO - [Task id] 312 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to find the shortest contiguous subarray within a given list of integers such that the sum of the elements in that subarray is at least a specified value, K. If no such subarray exists, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach combined with prefix sums. We will maintain a running sum of the elements as we iterate through the array. If the running sum exceeds or meets K, we will check the length of the current subarray and update our minimum length if it's shorter than any previously found subarray. If the running sum is less than K, we will continue to expand the window by adding more elements. We will also keep track of the starting index of the subarray to ensure we are always considering contiguous elements.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Initialize a variable min_length to infinity
   Initialize a variable current_sum to 0
   Initialize a list to store prefix sums with an initial value of 0
   For each element in the array:
       Add the element to current_sum
       Append current_sum to the prefix sums list
       For each previous prefix sum:
           If current_sum - previous_prefix_sum >= K:
               Calculate the length of the subarray

INFO - [Task id] 312 [generation text] The problem involved finding the length of the shortest contiguous subarray with a sum of at least K. The solution utilized a combination of prefix sums and a sliding window approach to efficiently track the sums of subarrays as we iterated through the list.

Key concepts included:
- **Prefix Sums**: This allowed for quick calculations of subarray sums by storing cumulative sums.
- **Sliding Window**: By maintaining a running sum and checking against previous prefix sums, we could dynamically adjust our search for valid subarrays.

The implemented solution successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was effective. The code iterated through the array, updated the current sum, and checked against previously stored prefix sums to determine valid subarrays. The minimum length was updated accordingly.

No unexpected errors were encountered, and the solution performed as expected within the constraints provided. This experience reinforced the importance of using efficient data structures and algorithms to handle potentially large input sizes.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 312 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to find the shortest contiguous subarray within a given list of integers such that the sum of the elements in that subarray is at least a specified value, K. If no such subarray exists, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach combined with prefix sums. We will maintain a running sum of the elements as we iterate through the array. If the running sum exceeds or meets K, we will check the length of the current subarray and update our minimum length if it's shorter than any previously found subarray. If the running sum is less than K, we will continue to expand the window by adding more elements. We will also keep track of the starting index of the subarray to ensure we are always considering contiguous elements.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Initialize a variable min_length to infinity
   Initialize a variable current_sum to 0
   Initialize a list to store prefix sums with an initial value of 0
   For each element in the array:
       Add the element to current_sum
       Append current_sum to the prefix sums list
       For each previous prefix sum:
           If current_sum - previous_prefix_sum >= K:
               Calculate the length of the subarray
               Update min_length if this length is shorter
   If min_length is still infinity, return -1
   Otherwise, return min_length
   ```

class Solution:

        cum_sum = 0
        queue = collections.deque([(-1, 0)])

            cum_sum += v

                # find any matches and remove them, since will never have a better match
                while queue and cum_sum - queue[0][1] >= K:
                    e = queue.popleft()
                    #print('remove candidate from start:', e)

                # for negative numbers pop off any greater cum sums, which will never be a better target
                while queue and cum_sum <= queue[-1][1]:
                    e = queue.pop()
                    #print('remove lesser from end:', e)
        
            queue.append((i, cum_sum))
            #print(queue)            
        return result if result <= len(A) else -1    

INFO - [Task id] 312 [generation text] The official solution employs a more efficient approach using a deque (double-ended queue) to maintain a list of cumulative sums and their corresponding indices. This method effectively reduces the time complexity compared to my initial approach, which involved nested loops to check all previous prefix sums.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Cumulative Sum**: The solution maintains a running cumulative sum (`cum_sum`) as it iterates through the array. This allows for quick calculations of subarray sums.

2. **Deque for Efficient Access**: The use of a deque allows for efficient removal of elements from both ends. This is crucial for maintaining a list of potential starting points for subarrays that could meet the sum requirement.

3. **Handling Positive and Negative Values**:
   - When encountering a positive value, the solution checks if the current cumulative sum minus the front of the deque (which holds the smallest cumulative sum seen so far) meets or exceeds K. If it does, it calculates the length of the subarray and updates the result.
   - For negative values, the solution removes any cumulative sums from the back of the deque that are greater than or equal to the current cumulative sum, as they cannot contribute to a shorter valid subarray.

4. **Final Result**: The result is updated only if a valid subarray is found, ensuring that the function returns -1 if no such subarray exists.

### Reflection on My Approach:
My initial approach was less efficient due to the nested loop structure, which resulted in a higher time complexity. The official solution's use of a deque allows it to efficiently manage potential starting points for subarrays, leading to a more optimal solution. This experience highlights the importance of considering data structures that can provide efficient access and modification capabilities when solving problems involving subarrays or sequences.
