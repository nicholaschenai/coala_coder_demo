    "summary": "The problem involved finding the length of the shortest contiguous subarray with a sum of at least K. The solution utilized a combination of prefix sums and a sliding window approach to efficiently track the sums of subarrays as we iterated through the list.\n\nKey concepts included:\n- **Prefix Sums**: This allowed for quick calculations of subarray sums by storing cumulative sums.\n- **Sliding Window**: By maintaining a running sum and checking against previous prefix sums, we could dynamically adjust our search for valid subarrays.\n\nThe implemented solution successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was effective. The code iterated through the array, updated the current sum, and checked against previously stored prefix sums to determine valid subarrays. The minimum length was updated accordingly.\n\nNo unexpected errors were encountered, and the solution performed as expected within the constraints provided. This experience reinforced the importance of using efficient data structures and algorithms to handle potentially large input sizes.",
    "reflection": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach using a deque (double-ended queue) to maintain a list of cumulative sums and their corresponding indices. This method effectively reduces the time complexity compared to my initial approach, which involved nested loops to check all previous prefix sums.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Cumulative Sum**: The solution maintains a running cumulative sum (`cum_sum`) as it iterates through the array. This allows for quick calculations of subarray sums.\n\n2. **Deque for Efficient Access**: The use of a deque allows for efficient removal of elements from both ends. This is crucial for maintaining a list of potential starting points for subarrays that could meet the sum requirement.\n\n3. **Handling Positive and Negative Values**:\n   - When encountering a positive value, the solution checks if the current cumulative sum minus the front of the deque (which holds the smallest cumulative sum seen so far) meets or exceeds K. If it does, it calculates the length of the subarray and updates the result.\n   - For negative values, the solution removes any cumulative sums from the back of the deque that are greater than or equal to the current cumulative sum, as they cannot contribute to a shorter valid subarray.\n\n4. **Final Result**: The result is updated only if a valid subarray is found, ensuring that the function returns -1 if no such subarray exists.\n\n### Reflection on My Approach:\nMy initial approach was less efficient due to the nested loop structure, which resulted in a higher time complexity. The official solution's use of a deque allows it to efficiently manage potential starting points for subarrays, leading to a more optimal solution. This experience highlights the importance of considering data structures that can provide efficient access and modification capabilities when solving problems involving subarrays or sequences.",
    "desc": "\n[description]\nThis function finds the length of the shortest contiguous subarray within a given list of integers that has a sum of at least K. It initializes a variable to track the minimum length and uses a prefix sum approach to efficiently calculate the sums of subarrays. As it iterates through the list, it updates the current sum and stores it in a prefix sums list. For each new sum, it checks previous prefix sums to determine if the difference meets or exceeds K, calculating the length of the corresponding subarray. The function updates the minimum length whenever a shorter valid subarray is found. Finally, it returns the minimum length if a valid subarray exists, or -1 if none is found.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to analyze subarrays of numerical data to find the shortest segment that meets a specific sum requirement. This can be applicable in various fields such as finance for analyzing profit/loss over time, in data analysis for finding trends, or in algorithm design where optimizing for performance is crucial. It can also be beneficial in competitive programming and coding interviews where such problems are common."
