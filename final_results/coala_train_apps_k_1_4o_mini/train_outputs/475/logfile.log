## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays fromÂ the array and then sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2Â numbers.
Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in theÂ new array.Â Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
Output: 13 
Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10
Output: 50

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
nums.length == n
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
1 <= left <= rightÂ <= n * (n + 1) / 2

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        
```

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have an array of positive integers, and we need to calculate the sums of all possible continuous subarrays. After calculating these sums, we will sort them in non-decreasing order. Finally, we need to return the sum of the elements in this sorted list from a specified starting index to an ending index, with the result given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - First, we will generate all possible continuous subarrays from the input array and calculate their sums.
   - We will store these sums in a new list.
   - Next, we will sort this list of sums.
   - Finally, we will compute the sum of the elements in the sorted list from the specified left index to the right index and return this sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function rangeSum(nums, n, left, right):
       initialize an empty list called subarray_sums
       
       for i from 0 to n-1:
           current_sum = 0
           for j from i to n-1:
               current_sum += nums[j]

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to compute the sum of squares of specific terms in the Golomb sequence for multiple test cases. The Golomb sequence is defined recursively, which posed a challenge due to the potential size of the indices (up to \(10^{10}\)). The key insight was to use memoization to efficiently compute the Golomb values without recalculating them multiple times.

    The approach involved defining a `golomb` function that uses a dictionary to store previously computed values, thus avoiding redundant calculations. The `sum_of_squares` function iterated through the specified range, calculating the Golomb values and their squares, while maintaining a running total modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow.

    The final implementation successfully handled the provided test cases, demonstrating that memoization effectively optimized the recursive computation of the Golomb sequence. However, the solution may still struggle with the upper limits of the constraints due to the inherent inefficiency of calculating each term individually for very large ranges. Future improvements could involve a more direct mathematical approach to derive the sum of squares over ranges without explicit iteration. 

    Hereâs the core code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    memo = {}

    def golomb(n):
        if n in memo:
            return memo[n]
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        else:
            result = 1 + golomb(n - golomb(golomb(n - 1)))
            memo[n] = result
            return result

    def sum_of_squares(L, R):
        sum = 0
        for i in range(L, R + 1):
            g_i = golomb(i)
            sum += g_i * g_i
            sum = sum % (10**9 + 7)
        return sum
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of memoization in recursive problems and highlighted the need for efficiency when dealing with large input sizes.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays fromÂ the array and then sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2Â numbers.
Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in theÂ new array.Â Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
Output: 13 
Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10
Output: 50

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
nums.length == n
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
1 <= left <= rightÂ <= n * (n + 1) / 2

INFO - [Task id] 475 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We have an array of positive integers, and we need to calculate the sums of all possible continuous subarrays. After calculating these sums, we sort them in non-decreasing order. Our goal is to return the sum of a specific range of these sorted sums, defined by two indices (left and right), while ensuring the result is within a certain limit (modulo \(10^9 + 7\)).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Generate all possible continuous subarrays from the input array and compute their sums.
   - Store these sums in a list.
   - Sort the list of sums.
   - Calculate the sum of the elements in the sorted list from the index specified by 'left' to 'right'.
   - Return this sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function rangeSum(nums, n, left, right):
       Initialize an empty list to store subarray sums
       for i from 0 to n-1:
           Initialize current_sum to 0
           for j from i to n-1:
               current_sum += nums[j]

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] In this task, I was required to compute the sum of all non-empty continuous subarrays from a given array of positive integers, sort these sums, and then return the sum of a specified range of these sorted sums. The problem tested the ability to generate subarrays, compute their sums, and handle sorting and indexing efficiently.

The solution involved iterating through the array to calculate all possible subarray sums, storing them in a list, and then sorting that list. After sorting, I summed the elements from the specified indices (left to right) and returned the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). 

The code implementation was straightforward and passed the provided test cases without issues. Key concepts included nested loops for subarray generation and the use of sorting to prepare for the final summation. The approach was efficient given the constraints, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. 

Hereâs the final code snippet for reference:

```python
class Solution:
    def rangeSum(self, nums: list[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        subarray_sums = []
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum = 0
            for j in range(i, n):
                current_sum += nums[j]
                subarray_sums.append(current_sum)
        subarray_sums.sort()
        total_sum = 0
        for k in range(left - 1, right):

            total_sum = total_sum % (10**9 + 7)
        return total_sum
``` 

This experience reinforced the importance of understanding array manipulation and the efficiency of sorting algorithms in solving problems involving combinations of elements.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays fromÂ the array and then sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2Â numbers.
Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in theÂ new array.Â Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
Output: 13 
Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10
Output: 50

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
nums.length == n
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
1 <= left <= rightÂ <= n * (n + 1) / 2

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] The official solution employs a more efficient approach using prefix sums and binary search, which significantly optimizes the process of calculating subarray sums compared to the brute-force method I initially implemented.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Prefix Sums**: The solution constructs two prefix sum arrays:
   - `B` holds the cumulative sums of the original array `A`.
   - `C` holds the cumulative sums of the array `B`. This allows for quick calculations of subarray sums.

2. **Counting Subarray Sums**: The function `count_sum_under(score)` uses a two-pointer technique to count how many subarray sums are less than or equal to a given score. This avoids the need to explicitly generate and sort all subarray sums, which can be computationally expensive.

3. **Binary Search for K-th Score**: The function `kth_score(k)` uses binary search to efficiently find the k-th smallest subarray sum. This is a significant improvement over sorting all sums, as it narrows down the search space logarithmically.

4. **Final Calculation**: The result is computed by finding the difference between the sums of subarrays up to the right index and those up to the left index, effectively giving the sum of the desired range.

### Reflection on My Approach:
While my initial approach was straightforward and worked for the provided test cases, it was not optimal for larger inputs due to its O(n^2 log n) complexity from generating and sorting all subarray sums. The official solution, on the other hand, operates in O(n log n) time complexity, making it much more efficient for the problem constraints.

In future implementations, I should consider leveraging prefix sums and efficient counting techniques to handle similar problems involving subarray sums, as they can drastically reduce computation time and improve performance.
