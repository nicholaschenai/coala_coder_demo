The Golomb sequence is defined recursively, which posed a challenge due to the potential size of the indices (up to \\(10^{10}\\)). The key insight was to use memoization to efficiently compute the Golomb values without recalculating them multiple times.\n\n    The approach involved defining a `golomb` function that uses a dictionary to store previously computed values, thus avoiding redundant calculations. The `sum_of_squares` function iterated through the specified range, calculating the Golomb values and their squares, while maintaining a running total modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to prevent overflow.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the provided test cases, demonstrating that memoization effectively optimized the recursive computation of the Golomb sequence. However, the solution may still struggle with the upper limits of the constraints due to the inherent inefficiency of calculating each term individually for very large ranges. Future improvements could involve a more direct mathematical approach to derive the sum of squares over ranges without explicit iteration. \n\n    Here\u2019s the core code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    memo = {}\n\n    def golomb(n):\n        if n in memo:\n            return memo[n]\n        if n == 1:\n            return 1\n        else:\n            result = 1 + golomb(n - golomb(golomb(n - 1)))\n            memo[n] = result\n            return result\n\n    def sum_of_squares(L, R):\n        sum = 0\n        for i in range(L, R + 1):\n            g_i = golomb(i)\n            sum += g_i * g_i\n            sum = sum % (10**9 + 7)\n        return sum\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of memoization in recursive problems and highlighted the need for efficiency when dealing with large input sizes.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This allows for quick calculations of subarray sums.\n\n2. **Counting Subarray Sums**: The function `count_sum_under(score)` uses a two-pointer technique to count how many subarray sums are less than or equal to a given score. This avoids the need to explicitly generate and sort all subarray sums, which can be computationally expensive.\n\n3. **Binary Search for K-th Score**: The function `kth_score(k)` uses binary search to efficiently find the k-th smallest subarray sum. This is a significant improvement over sorting all sums, as it narrows down the search space logarithmically.\n\n4. **Final Calculation**: The result is computed by finding the difference between the sums of subarrays up to the right index and those up to the left index, effectively giving the sum of the desired range.\n\n### Reflection on My Approach:\nWhile my initial approach was straightforward and worked for the provided test cases, it was not optimal for larger inputs due to its O(n^2 log n) complexity from generating and sorting all subarray sums. The official solution, on the other hand, operates in O(n log n) time complexity, making it much more efficient for the problem constraints.\n\nIn future implementations, I should consider leveraging prefix sums and efficient counting techniques to handle similar problems involving subarray sums, as they can drastically reduce computation time and improve performance."
