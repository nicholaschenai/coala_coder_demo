INFO - [Task id] 837 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to calculate the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number "N". We will do this for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each test case, we will find the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to N. This can be done by taking the integer division of N by 10 and then multiplying by 10.
   - Once we have the largest multiple of 10, we can calculate the sum of all multiples of 10 up to that number. The multiples of 10 form an arithmetic series where the first term is 10, the last term is the largest multiple of 10, and the common difference is also 10.
   - The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
     \]
     where \( n \) is the number of terms. The number of terms can be found by dividing the largest multiple of 10 by 10.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sum_of_multiples_of_10(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N = test_case
           largest_multiple_of_10 = (N // 10) * 10
           number_of_terms = largest_multiple_of_10 // 10
           sum = (number_of_terms / 2) * (10 + largest_multiple_of_10)
           print(sum)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def sum_of_multiples_of_10(T, test_cases):
    # Iterate through each test case
    for N in test_cases:
        # Find the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N
        largest_multiple_of_10 = (N // 10) * 10
        # Calculate the number of terms in the series of multiples of 10

        # Calculate the sum using the arithmetic series formula

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series defined as 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, etc. Initially, I misidentified the formula for generating the series, which led to incorrect outputs. The series is generated by the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares, which can be calculated using the formula:

    \[ T(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2(N-1) + 1)}{6} \]

    This formula derives from the known formula for the sum of the first k squares.

    The initial approach incorrectly used a different formula, resulting in outputs that did not match the expected results. After analyzing the series and identifying the correct pattern, I revised the code to implement the correct formula, which successfully passed all test cases.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def find_nth_number(N):
        if N == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            return ((N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1)) // 6

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        result = find_nth_number(N)
        print(result)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring the correct mathematical formulas are applied.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:

    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 837 [generation text] The problem involved calculating the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to a given number N for multiple test cases. The key concept was recognizing that the multiples of 10 form an arithmetic series, which can be efficiently summed using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

The solution involved determining the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N, calculating the number of terms in the series, and then applying the sum formula. The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the constraints provided.

The final code snippet is as follows:

```python
def sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):
    largest_multiple = (N // 10) * 10
    number_of_terms = largest_multiple // 10
    sum = (number_of_terms * (10 + largest_multiple)) // 2
    return sum

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)
    print(result)
```

This experience reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in mathematical problems and leveraging formulas for efficiency, especially when dealing with potentially large inputs. No unexpected errors occurred during the implementation, and the solution passed all test cases successfully.

   The task is to calculate the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number "N". We will be given multiple test cases, and for each test case, we need to output the calculated sum.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the sum of multiples of 10 up to a number N, we can identify the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to N. This can be done by taking the integer division of N by 10 and then multiplying the result by 10. The multiples of 10 up to this number form an arithmetic series where the first term is 10 and the last term is the largest multiple of 10. The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: 
   \[
   \text{Sum} = \frac{\text{number of terms}}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
   \]
   The number of terms can be found by dividing the largest multiple of 10 by 10.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):
       largest_multiple = (N // 10) * 10
       number_of_terms = largest_multiple // 10
       sum = (number_of_terms / 2) * (10 + largest_multiple)
       return sum

   read integer T
   for each test case from 1 to T:
       read integer N
       result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)
       print result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):
    # Find the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N
    largest_multiple = (N // 10) * 10
    # Calculate the number of terms in the series of multiples of 10
    number_of_terms = largest_multiple // 10
    # Calculate the sum of the arithmetic series
    sum = (number_of_terms * (10 + largest_multiple)) // 2
    return sum

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    # Read each value of N
    N = int(input())
    # Calculate the result for the current test case
    result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)
    # Print the result
    print(result)

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for t in range(eval(input())):
 n=eval(input())
 n-=n%10
 n/=10
 print(n*(n+1)/2*10)

INFO - [Task id] 837 [generation text] The official solution provided is concise and efficient, leveraging a mathematical approach to calculate the sum of multiples of 10. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Direct Calculation**: The official solution directly calculates the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N by subtracting the remainder when N is divided by 10 (`n -= n % 10`). This avoids the need for loops or complex iterations.

2. **Arithmetic Series Formula**: It uses the formula for the sum of the first `k` integers, where `k` is the number of multiples of 10 up to the largest multiple. The number of terms is derived by dividing the largest multiple by 10 (`n /= 10`), and the sum is calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `k` integers multiplied by 10.

3. **Efficiency**: The solution operates in constant time O(1) for each test case, as it only involves a few arithmetic operations regardless of the size of N. This is particularly important given the constraints where N can be as large as 1 billion.

4. **Output**: The final result is printed directly, which is efficient for handling multiple test cases.

In contrast, my initial approach was more verbose and involved multiple steps, including calculating the number of terms and the sum separately. While it was correct, it could be optimized by directly applying the arithmetic series formula as shown in the official solution. 

Overall, the official solution's use of direct arithmetic manipulation and the sum formula makes it a more elegant and efficient approach to solving the problem.
