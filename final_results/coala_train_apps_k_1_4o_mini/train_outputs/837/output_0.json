    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to calculate the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number \"N\". We will be given multiple test cases, and for each test case, we need to output the calculated sum.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the sum of multiples of 10 up to a number N, we can identify the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to N. This can be done by taking the integer division of N by 10 and then multiplying the result by 10. The multiples of 10 up to this number form an arithmetic series where the first term is 10 and the last term is the largest multiple of 10. The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = \\frac{\\text{number of terms}}{2} \\times (\\text{first term} + \\text{last term})\n   \\]\n   The number of terms can be found by dividing the largest multiple of 10 by 10.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):\n       largest_multiple = (N // 10) * 10\n       number_of_terms = largest_multiple // 10\n       sum = (number_of_terms / 2) * (10 + largest_multiple)\n       return sum\n\n   read integer T\n   for each test case from 1 to T:\n       read integer N\n       result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)\n       print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):\n    # Find the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N\n    largest_multiple = (N // 10) * 10\n    # Calculate the number of terms in the series of multiples of 10\n    number_of_terms = largest_multiple // 10\n    # Calculate the sum of the arithmetic series\n    sum = (number_of_terms * (10 + largest_multiple)) // 2\n    return sum\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    # Read each value of N\n    N = int(input())\n    # Calculate the result for the current test case\n    result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)\n    # Print the result\n    print(result)\n```",
