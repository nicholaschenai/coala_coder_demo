The series is generated by the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\n    \\[ T(N) = \\frac{(N-1) \\cdot N \\cdot (2(N-1) + 1)}{6} \\]\n\n    This formula derives from the known formula for the sum of the first k squares.\n\n    The initial approach incorrectly used a different formula, resulting in outputs that did not match the expected results. After analyzing the series and identifying the correct pattern, I revised the code to implement the correct formula, which successfully passed all test cases.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_nth_number(N):\n        if N == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            return ((N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1)) // 6\n\n    T = int(input())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        result = find_nth_number(N)\n        print(result)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring the correct mathematical formulas are applied.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Direct Calculation**: The official solution directly calculates the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N by subtracting the remainder when N is divided by 10 (`n -= n % 10`). This avoids the need for loops or complex iterations.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Series Formula**: It uses the formula for the sum of the first `k` integers, where `k` is the number of multiples of 10 up to the largest multiple. The number of terms is derived by dividing the largest multiple by 10 (`n /= 10`), and the sum is calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `k` integers multiplied by 10.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The solution operates in constant time O(1) for each test case, as it only involves a few arithmetic operations regardless of the size of N. This is particularly important given the constraints where N can be as large as 1 billion.\n\n4. **Output**: The final result is printed directly, which is efficient for handling multiple test cases.\n\nIn contrast, my initial approach was more verbose and involved multiple steps, including calculating the number of terms and the sum separately. While it was correct, it could be optimized by directly applying the arithmetic series formula as shown in the official solution. \n\nOverall, the official solution's use of direct arithmetic manipulation and the sum formula makes it a more elegant and efficient approach to solving the problem."

Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, it calculates the total sum of these multiples. Finally, the computed sum is returned as the output.

It can be applied in programming contests, algorithm design, or any situation where performance and handling of large integers are critical.
