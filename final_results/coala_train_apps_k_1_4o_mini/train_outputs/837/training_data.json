    "summary": "The problem involved calculating the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to a given number N for multiple test cases. The key concept was recognizing that the multiples of 10 form an arithmetic series, which can be efficiently summed using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\n\nThe solution involved determining the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N, calculating the number of terms in the series, and then applying the sum formula. The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the constraints provided.\n\nThe final code snippet is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):\n    largest_multiple = (N // 10) * 10\n    number_of_terms = largest_multiple // 10\n    sum = (number_of_terms * (10 + largest_multiple)) // 2\n    return sum\n\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())\n    result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)\n    print(result)\n```\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in mathematical problems and leveraging formulas for efficiency, especially when dealing with potentially large inputs. No unexpected errors occurred during the implementation, and the solution passed all test cases successfully.",
    "reflection": "The official solution provided is concise and efficient, leveraging a mathematical approach to calculate the sum of multiples of 10. Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Direct Calculation**: The official solution directly calculates the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N by subtracting the remainder when N is divided by 10 (`n -= n % 10`). This avoids the need for loops or complex iterations.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Series Formula**: It uses the formula for the sum of the first `k` integers, where `k` is the number of multiples of 10 up to the largest multiple. The number of terms is derived by dividing the largest multiple by 10 (`n /= 10`), and the sum is calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `k` integers multiplied by 10.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The solution operates in constant time O(1) for each test case, as it only involves a few arithmetic operations regardless of the size of N. This is particularly important given the constraints where N can be as large as 1 billion.\n\n4. **Output**: The final result is printed directly, which is efficient for handling multiple test cases.\n\nIn contrast, my initial approach was more verbose and involved multiple steps, including calculating the number of terms and the sum separately. While it was correct, it could be optimized by directly applying the arithmetic series formula as shown in the official solution. \n\nOverall, the official solution's use of direct arithmetic manipulation and the sum formula makes it a more elegant and efficient approach to solving the problem.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: sum_of_multiples_of_10]\nThis function calculates the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to a given integer N. It first determines the largest multiple of 10 within the range, then computes the number of terms in the series of multiples of 10. Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, it calculates the total sum of these multiples. Finally, the computed sum is returned as the output. The function efficiently handles the calculation using basic arithmetic operations. It is designed to work with multiple test cases as indicated in the surrounding code.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to calculate the sum of multiples of a specific number (in this case, 10) efficiently, especially when dealing with large upper limits (up to 1 billion). It can be applied in programming contests, algorithm design, or any situation where performance and handling of large integers are critical. Understanding how to derive the sum of an arithmetic series can also be beneficial in mathematical problem-solving and optimization tasks."
