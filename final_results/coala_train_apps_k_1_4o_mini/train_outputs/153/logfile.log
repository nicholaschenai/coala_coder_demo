## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Remember the story of Little Match Girl? By now, you know exactly what matchsticks the little match girl has, please find out a way you can make one square by using up all those matchsticks. You should not break any stick, but you can link them up, and each matchstick must be used exactly one time.

 Your input will be several matchsticks the girl has, represented with their stick length. Your output will either be true or false, to represent whether you could make one square using all the matchsticks the little match girl has.

Example 1:

Input: [1,1,2,2,2]
Output: true

Explanation: You can form a square with length 2, one side of the square came two sticks with length 1.



Example 2:

Input: [3,3,3,3,4]
Output: false

Explanation: You cannot find a way to form a square with all the matchsticks.



Note:

The length sum of the given matchsticks is in the range of 0 to 10^9.
The length of the given matchstick array will not exceed 15.

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def makesquare(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        
```

3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

INFO - [Task id] 153 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem is to determine if we can use a given set of matchsticks, each with a specific length, to form a perfect square. Each matchstick must be used exactly once, and we cannot break any matchstick.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to check if the total length of all matchsticks can be evenly divided into four equal parts (sides of a square). If the total length is not divisible by 4, we can immediately return false. If it is divisible, we can use a backtracking approach to try to build each side of the square recursively, ensuring that we do not exceed the target length for each side.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function makesquare(nums):
       total_length = sum(nums)
       if total_length % 4 != 0:
           return false
       side_length = total_length / 4
       sort nums in descending order
       return backtrack(nums, 0, [0, 0, 0, 0], side_length)

   function backtrack(nums, index, sides, target):
       if index == length of nums:
           return all sides are equal to target
       for i from 0 to 3:
           if sides[i] + nums[index] <= target:
               sides[i] += nums[index]
               if backtrack(nums, index + 1, sides, target):
                   return true
               sides[i] -= nums[index]
       return false
   ```

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing elements based on their indices. The key insight was recognizing that the maximum reduction possible is the sum of the first N natural numbers, which can be calculated using the formula \(N \times (N + 1) / 2\).

    Initially, the solution incorrectly handled the conditions for determining if the sequence could be made "good." The logic needed to explicitly check if the total sum was zero, if it was positive and could be reduced to zero, or if it was negative, which would immediately result in "NO." 

    The final working solution iterates through each test case, calculates the total sum and maximum reduction, and checks the conditions correctly. The code snippet that encapsulates the solution is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            A = case[1]
            total_sum = sum(A)
            max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2
        
            if total_sum == 0:
                print("YES")
            elif total_sum > 0 and total_sum <= max_reduction:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all possible conditions and edge cases when solving problems involving sums and modifications of sequences.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Remember the story of Little Match Girl? By now, you know exactly what matchsticks the little match girl has, please find out a way you can make one square by using up all those matchsticks. You should not break any stick, but you can link them up, and each matchstick must be used exactly one time.

 Your input will be several matchsticks the girl has, represented with their stick length. Your output will either be true or false, to represent whether you could make one square using all the matchsticks the little match girl has.

Example 1:

Input: [1,1,2,2,2]
Output: true

Explanation: You can form a square with length 2, one side of the square came two sticks with length 1.



Example 2:

Input: [3,3,3,3,4]
Output: false

Explanation: You cannot find a way to form a square with all the matchsticks.



Note:

The length sum of the given matchsticks is in the range of 0 to 10^9.
The length of the given matchstick array will not exceed 15.

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with:

INFO - [Task id] 153 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to determine if a given set of matchsticks can be arranged to form a perfect square. Each matchstick has a specific length, and we must use all of them exactly once without breaking any. The output should be true if it's possible to form a square and false otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we need to check if the total length of all matchsticks can be evenly divided into four equal parts (since a square has four sides). If the total length is not divisible by four, we can immediately return false. If it is divisible, we can use a backtracking approach to try to build each side of the square recursively, ensuring that we do not exceed the target length for each side.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function makesquare(nums):
       total_length = sum(nums)
       if total_length % 4 != 0:
           return false
       side_length = total_length / 4
       sort nums in descending order
       return backtrack(nums, 0, [0, 0, 0, 0], side_length)

   function backtrack(nums, index, sides, target):
       if index == length of nums:
           return all sides are equal to target
       for i from 0 to 3:
           if sides[i] + nums[index] <= target:
               sides[i] += nums[index]
               if backtrack(nums, index + 1, sides, target):
                   return true
               sides[i] -= nums[index]
       return false

INFO - [Task id] 153 [generation text] The problem involved determining if a set of matchsticks could be arranged to form a perfect square. The key concepts tested were the ability to calculate the total length of the matchsticks, check for divisibility by four, and implement a backtracking algorithm to explore possible combinations of matchstick placements.

The solution involved first calculating the total length of the matchsticks and checking if it was divisible by four. If it was, the next step was to sort the matchsticks in descending order to optimize the backtracking process. The backtracking function attempted to place each matchstick on one of the four sides of the square, ensuring that the total length of each side did not exceed the target length.

The final implementation successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was effective. The use of backtracking allowed for exploring all possible configurations while maintaining efficiency by pruning invalid paths early. This experience reinforced the importance of both mathematical checks (like divisibility) and algorithmic strategies (like backtracking) in solving combinatorial problems. 

Here is the final code snippet for reference:

```python
class Solution:
    def makesquare(self, nums: list[int]) -> bool:
        total_length = sum(nums)
        if total_length % 4 != 0:
            return False
        side_length = total_length // 4
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        sides = [0] * 4
        return self.backtrack(nums, 0, sides, side_length)

    def backtrack(self, nums, index, sides, target):
        if index == len(nums):
            return all(side == target for side in sides)

INFO - [Task id] 153 [generation text] The official solution to the problem of forming a square with matchsticks provides a clear and efficient approach. Here are the key insights and steps that stand out:

1. **Initial Checks**: The solution begins by checking if the number of matchsticks is less than four, which would make it impossible to form a square. It also checks if the total length of the matchsticks is divisible by four, as this is a prerequisite for forming a square.

2. **Target Length Calculation**: The target length for each side of the square is calculated by dividing the total length by four. This is a crucial step as it sets the goal for the backtracking process.

3. **Sorting**: The matchsticks are sorted in descending order. This is an important optimization because it allows the algorithm to attempt to place the longest matchsticks first, which can lead to quicker failures in invalid configurations.

4. **Stack-Based Backtracking**: Instead of using recursion, the official solution employs an iterative approach with a stack. This method keeps track of the indices of used matchsticks, the current target length for the side being formed, and the number of remaining sides to complete. This avoids the overhead of recursive function calls and can be more efficient in terms of space.

5. **Valid Path Exploration**: The algorithm explores potential placements of matchsticks by checking if adding a matchstick would exceed the current target length. If a matchstick exactly matches the target, it checks if all sides have been formed. If not, it continues to explore other possibilities.

6. **Efficiency**: The use of a set to track used indices and the careful management of the stack allows the algorithm to efficiently explore valid configurations without redundant checks.

Overall, the official solution is effective due to its combination of initial checks, sorting, and an iterative backtracking approach that efficiently explores potential configurations. This contrasts with my initial recursive approach, which, while functional, may not have been as optimized for performance and could lead to deeper recursion levels. The iterative method also provides clearer control over the state of the search, which can be beneficial in complex scenarios.

[Solution]

    class Solution:
        def makesquare(self, nums: list[int]) -> bool:
            # Calculate the total length of all matchsticks
            total_length = sum(nums)
        
            # Check if the total length is divisible by 4
            if total_length % 4 != 0:
                return False
        
            # Determine the target length for each side of the square
            side_length = total_length // 4
        
            # Sort the matchsticks in descending order for better backtracking performance
            nums.sort(reverse=True)
        
            # Initialize an array to keep track of the current length of each side
            sides = [0] * 4
        
            # Start the backtracking process
            return self.backtrack(nums, 0, sides, side_length)

        def backtrack(self, nums, index, sides, target):
            # If we have used all matchsticks, check if all sides are equal to the target
            if index == len(nums):
                return all(side == target for side in sides)
        
            # Try to place the current matchstick in one of the four sides
            for i in range(4):
                # If adding the matchstick does not exceed the target length
                if sides[i] + nums[index] <= target:
                    sides[i] += nums[index]  # Place the matchstick
                    # Recur to place the next matchstick
                    if self.backtrack(nums, index + 1, sides, target):
                        return True
                    sides[i] -= nums[index]  # Backtrack
        
            return False  # If no valid placement found
