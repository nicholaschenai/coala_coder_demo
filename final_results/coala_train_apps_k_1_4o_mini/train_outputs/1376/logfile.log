## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Salmon has a number of rubber ducks of different colors and wants to organize them into boxes. Each box can hold a specific number of ducks, and he wants to ensure that each box contains at most two different colors of ducks. The task is to determine how to distribute the ducks into the boxes while adhering to these constraints.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of duck colors and their counts. We will fill each box with ducks, ensuring that we do not exceed the box capacity and that we only use up to two colors per box. We can keep track of how many ducks of each color we have left and fill the boxes accordingly. If we run out of ducks of one color, we can continue filling the box with the remaining color.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, K
           read duck_counts
           initialize an empty list for boxes
           for i from 0 to N-1:
               initialize box with (0, 0, 0, 0) for colors and counts
               fill the box with ducks:
                   while box is not full:
                       if there are ducks of color 0:
                           add ducks of color 0 to box
                       if there are ducks of color 1:
                           add ducks of color 1 to box
                       continue until the box is full or no ducks left
               add filled box to boxes
           output boxes
   ```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the problems created by several setters. The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems available and calculating how many contests could be formed based on the required number of problems per contest, while also considering the limited number of days available.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, summing the problems from each setter, and then calculating the number of contests possible by dividing the total problems by the number of problems needed for one contest. The final result for each test case was the minimum of the contests possible and the days available.

    The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the constraints provided. The code was structured to read input, process each test case, and output the results efficiently. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all test cases, demonstrating that the approach was effective. 

    Key code snippet:
    ```python
    total_problems = sum(A)
    contests_possible = total_problems // K
    max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all constraints are considered in the final calculations.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1376 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Salmon has a number of rubber ducks of different colors and wants to organize them into boxes. Each box can hold a specific number of ducks, and he wants to ensure that each box contains at most two different colors of ducks. The task is to determine how to distribute the ducks into the boxes while adhering to these constraints.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each test case, read the number of colors and the number of ducks each box can hold.
   - Count how many ducks there are of each color.
   - Start filling the boxes with ducks, ensuring that no box has more than two colors and that the total number of ducks in each box does not exceed the box's capacity.
   - If a box can be filled with ducks of one color, do so, and if there are ducks left of another color, fill the remaining space with those ducks.
   - Continue this process until all boxes are filled.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, K
           read duck_counts

                   find the first two colors with available ducks
                   fill the box with ducks from these colors

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Salmon has a number of rubber ducks of different colors and wants to organize them into boxes. Each box can hold a specific number of ducks, and he wants to ensure that each box contains at most two different colors of ducks. The task is to determine how to distribute the ducks into the boxes while adhering to these constraints.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each test case, read the number of colors and the number of ducks each box can hold.
   - Count how many ducks there are of each color.
   - Start filling the boxes with ducks, ensuring that no box has more than two colors and that the total number of ducks in each box does not exceed the box's capacity.
   - If a box can be filled with ducks of one color, do so, and if there are ducks left of another color, fill the remaining space with those ducks.
   - Continue this process until all boxes are filled.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, K
           read duck_counts
           initialize boxes as empty list
           for i from 0 to N-1:
               initialize box as empty list
               while box is not full:
                   find the first two colors with available ducks
                   fill the box with ducks from these colors
                   update the counts of ducks
               add box to boxes
           return boxes
   ```

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

-----Output:-----
- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

-----Constraints-----
- $T=10$
- $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
- $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
- There can be a color with $0$ ducks

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
1
2 4
3 4 1

-----Sample Output:-----
2 1 1 3
1 1 0 3

-----Explanation:-----
- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to distribute rubber ducks of various colors into boxes while adhering to specific constraints: each box can hold a fixed number of ducks and can contain at most two distinct colors. The solution involved iterating through the available colors and filling each box until it reached its capacity.

The core concept tested here was the ability to manage counts of items (ducks) and ensure that the constraints of color mixing and box capacity were respected. A systematic approach was used to fill each box, checking for available colors and their counts, and adjusting as ducks were placed into boxes.

One key strategy that worked well was maintaining a pointer to track which colors still had ducks available, allowing for efficient filling of boxes. However, care had to be taken to reset this pointer appropriately for each new box. The output format required specific handling to ensure that even if a box contained only one color, the output still reflected two color slots, with the second color set to zero if necessary.

The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that the results were printed in the correct format. The solution was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the problem constraints.

   - For each test case, read the number of colors and the number of ducks each box can hold.
   - Count how many ducks there are of each color.
   - Start filling the boxes with ducks, ensuring that no box has more than two colors and that the total number of ducks in each box does not exceed the box's capacity.
   - If a box can be filled with ducks of one color, do so, and if there are ducks left of another color, fill the remaining space with those ducks.
   - Continue this process until all boxes are filled.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, K
           read duck_counts
           initialize boxes as empty list
           for i from 0 to N-1:
               initialize box as empty list
               while box is not full:
                   find the first two colors with available ducks
                   fill the box with ducks from these colors
                   update the counts of ducks
               add box to boxes
           return boxes
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    
    for case in test_cases:

INFO - [Task id] 1376 [generation text] The official solution provides a structured approach to solving the problem of distributing rubber ducks into boxes while adhering to the constraints of color mixing and box capacity. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of test cases and the respective values for each test case, including the number of colors and the capacity of each box.

2. **Color Management**: The solution uses a list to keep track of the number of ducks of each color. It also creates a mapping (`d`) to associate the original indices of colors with their sorted positions. This helps in efficiently managing the colors while filling the boxes.

3. **Box Filling Logic**:
   - The solution employs a while loop to fill each box until all boxes are filled (`m < n`).
   - It checks if the current color has enough ducks to fill a box. If so, it fills the box with that color.
   - If the current color does not have enough ducks, it looks for another color to combine with the current one to meet the box capacity.
   - The solution ensures that it does not exceed the box capacity and maintains the constraint of using at most two colors.

4. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles specific cases, such as when there are only two colors and a specific box capacity, by implementing tailored logic to ensure proper filling.

5. **Efficiency**: The approach is efficient in terms of both time and space, as it iterates through the colors and boxes in a structured manner without unnecessary complexity.

Overall, the official solution effectively breaks down the problem into manageable parts, ensuring that all constraints are met while maintaining clarity in the logic. This structured approach can serve as a useful reference for similar problems involving distribution and constraints.

[Problem]
    Salmon loves to be a tidy person. One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.
    Each rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.
    Salmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.
    Please help Salmon achieve this goal!

    It can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.

    If there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   

    -----Input:-----
    - The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   
    - The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   
    - The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \leq i \leq N$

    -----Output:-----
    - Output $N$ lines for each testcase. 
    - The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \leq m1,m2 \leq K$ and $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$. 
    - Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \leq c1,c2 \leq N$.
    - The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $T=10$
    - $2 \leq N \leq 10^5$ 
    - $2 \leq K \leq 10^5$ 
    - Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$
    - There can be a color with $0$ ducks

    -----Subtasks-----
    - Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \leq N \leq 10$, $K=2$ 
    - Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$
    - Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints

    -----Sample Input:-----
    1
    2 4
    3 4 1

    -----Sample Output:-----
    2 1 1 3
    1 1 0 3

    -----Explanation:-----
    - In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   
    - The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   
    - Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.
