One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.\nEach rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.\nSalmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.\nPlease help Salmon achieve this goal!\n\nIt can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.\n\nIf there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   \n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   \n- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   \n- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \\leq i \\leq N$\n\n-----Output:-----\n- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. \n- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \\leq m1,m2 \\leq K$ and $0 \\leq c1,c2 \\leq N$. \n- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \\leq c1,c2 \\leq N$.\n- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $T=10$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$ \n- $2 \\leq K \\leq 10^5$ \n- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$\n- There can be a color with $0$ ducks\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \\leq N \\leq 10$, $K=2$ \n- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$\n- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n1\n2 4\n3 4 1\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n2 1 1 3\n1 1 0 3\n\n-----Explanation:-----\n- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   \n- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   \n- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems available and calculating how many contests could be formed based on the required number of problems per contest, while also considering the limited number of days available.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, summing the problems from each setter, and then calculating the number of contests possible by dividing the total problems by the number of problems needed for one contest. The final result for each test case was the minimum of the contests possible and the days available.\n\n    The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the constraints provided.

Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of test cases and the respective values for each test case, including the number of colors and the capacity of each box.\n\n2. **Color Management**: The solution uses a list to keep track of the number of ducks of each color. It also creates a mapping (`d`) to associate the original indices of colors with their sorted positions. This helps in efficiently managing the colors while filling the boxes.\n\n3. **Box Filling Logic**:\n   - The solution employs a while loop to fill each box until all boxes are filled (`m < n`).\n   - It checks if the current color has enough ducks to fill a box. If so, it fills the box with that color.\n   - If the current color does not have enough ducks, it looks for another color to combine with the current one to meet the box capacity.\n   - The solution ensures that it does not exceed the box capacity and maintains the constraint of using at most two colors.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles specific cases, such as when there are only two colors and a specific box capacity, by implementing tailored logic to ensure proper filling.\n\n5. **Efficiency**: The approach is efficient in terms of both time and space, as it iterates through the colors and boxes in a structured manner without unnecessary complexity.\n\nOverall, the official solution effectively breaks down the problem into manageable parts, ensuring that all constraints are met while maintaining clarity in the logic. This structured approach can serve as a useful reference for similar problems involving distribution and constraints."

It keeps track of the colors and their respective counts as it fills each box, prioritizing the addition of ducks until the box reaches its capacity.

This can apply to various fields such as logistics, inventory management, and even game design where items need to be organized efficiently. Understanding how to manage constraints while ensuring all items are accounted for is crucial in optimizing space and resources."
