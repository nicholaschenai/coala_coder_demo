    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to generate a specific pattern based on an integer input K for multiple test cases. For each test case, we need to print K lines, where each line consists of a sequence of '1's and '0's. The first line should have one '1', the second line should have two characters alternating starting with '1', and this continues until the K-th line, which will have K characters.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We will read the number of test cases and for each test case, we will read the integer K. For each K, we will generate K lines. Each line will consist of a repeated pattern of '1's and '0's, where the number of characters in each line corresponds to the line number (1-indexed). The first line will have one character, the second line will have two characters, and so on, up to K characters in the K-th line.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function print_pattern(T, test_cases):\n       for each test case in test_cases:\n           K = test case\n           for i from 1 to K:\n               line = \"\"\n               for j from 0 to i-1:\n                   if j is even:\n                       line += \"1\"\n                   else:\n                       line += \"0\"\n               print line\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef print_pattern(T, test_cases):\n    # Iterate through each test case\n    for k in test_cases:\n        K = k\n        # Generate K lines for the current test case\n        for i in range(1, K + 1):\n            line = \"\"\n            # Create the line with alternating '1's and '0's\n            for j in range(i):\n                if j % 2 == 0:\n                    line += \"1\"\n                else:\n                    line += \"0\"\n            # Print the generated line\n            print(line)\n\n# Read input from standard input\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(T)]\nprint_pattern(T, test_cases)\n```",
