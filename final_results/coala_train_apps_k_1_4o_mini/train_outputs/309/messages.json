The solution involved using dynamic programming to build an array that tracks the length of the LIS ending at each index. The core concept was to compare each element with all previous elements to determine if they could form an increasing sequence.\n\n    The implemented algorithm runs in O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for this problem. The approach involved initializing a list `d` where each element starts with a value of 1 (indicating that the minimum LIS length for any single element is 1). The nested loops then updated this list based on comparisons between elements.\n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n            n = len(nums)\n            if n == 0:\n                return 0\n            d = [1] * n\n        \n            for i in range(1, n):\n                for j in range(i):\n                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n            return max(d)\n    ```\n\n    This solution was effective and passed the provided test case, demonstrating a solid understanding of dynamic programming principles.

This helps in quickly identifying the most common elements, which can be useful for determining potential subsequences.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: A 2D list `dp` is initialized to store the lengths of arithmetic subsequences. Each entry `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence that ends with the elements at indices `i` and `j`.\n\n3. **Index Mapping**: The solution maintains a dictionary `index` to map each number to its most recent index. This allows for quick lookups when checking if a required previous number (to form an arithmetic sequence) exists.\n\n4. **Iterative Comparison**: The solution iterates through pairs of indices `(i, j)` where `j > i`. For each pair, it calculates the required previous number `b` that would complete the arithmetic sequence. If `b` exists in the `index` dictionary, it updates the `dp` table accordingly.\n\n5. **Max Length Calculation**: The maximum length of any arithmetic subsequence is tracked throughout the iterations, ensuring that the final result reflects the longest found.\n\n### Reflection on My Approach:\n\nMy initial approach was based on a straightforward dynamic programming method that tracked differences between pairs of elements. While it was conceptually sound, it lacked the efficiency of the official solution. Specifically, I did not utilize a mapping for quick lookups of previous elements needed to form arithmetic sequences, which led to a more complex and potentially slower solution.\n\nThe official solution's use of a 2D list for dynamic programming combined with a dictionary for index mapping allows it to efficiently check for valid subsequences without redundant calculations. This results in a more optimal time complexity, making it better suited for larger input sizes.\n\nIn future implementations, I will consider integrating counting and mapping strategies to enhance efficiency, especially in problems involving subsequences or combinations."
