## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The MarkiT online virtual market startup wants to organize its grand opening in NIT Patna.
but they want maximum crowd for their inauguration. So the manager told  this  to Praveen a student in NITP who suggested them:
The first-year students come to campus  every x hour,
Second-year students come to campus every y hour,
Third-year students come to campus every z hour and 
Fourth-year is very busy so they don't come regularly.
So Praveen being very clever told him the no of times in n days he can have an audience of all year student (1st,2nd & 3rd) at max. So can you code what Praveen has done?

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a 2 line of input, first line contain one  integers $N$ (No of Days). 
-Next line contain 3 space separated integer the  value of x y z

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line answer the no of times audience consists of all year.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^8$
- $1 \leq x,y,z \leq 10^5$

-----Sample Input:-----
1
10
8 10 6

-----Sample Output:-----
2

-----EXPLANATION:-----
First favourable condition will come on 5th day and Second on 10th day.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 694 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem requires us to determine how many times all first, second, and third-year students will be present on campus together over a given number of days. Each group of students comes to campus at regular intervals defined by the integers x, y, and z, which represent the hours between their arrivals. We need to find out how many times all three groups will be present together within a specified number of days.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals (x, y, z). The LCM will give us the time in hours when all three groups will be present together. Once we have the LCM, we can calculate how many times this LCM fits into the total hours available in N days (which is N * 24 hours). The result will be the number of times all three groups will be present together.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function gcd(a, b):
       while b is not 0:
           a, b = b, a % b
       return a

   function lcm(a, b):
       return (a * b) / gcd(a, b)

   function lcm_of_three(x, y, z):
       return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)

   function count_audience(N, x, y, z):
       total_hours = N * 24
       lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
       return total_hours // lcm_value

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to compute the mean of maximum scores for students after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the question if they fall within a specified roll number range. 

    The approach involved initializing a list of scores for all students, processing each question to update the scores based on the given range and complexity, and finally calculating the mean score. The solution was implemented efficiently to handle the constraints, particularly the potential large input sizes.

    The final code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic for updating scores was straightforward. The key takeaway was the importance of managing index conversions (from 1-based to 0-based) when processing the roll number ranges. The solution passed the provided test case, confirming its correctness. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def calculate_mean_scores(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, M = map(int, input().split())
            scores = [10] * N
            for _ in range(M):
                i, j, k = map(int, input().split())
                for student in range(i - 1, j):  # Convert to 0-based index
                    scores[student] *= k
            mean_score = sum(scores) // N
            print(mean_score)

    T = int(input())
    calculate_mean_scores(T)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful index management and efficient score updates in competitive programming scenarios.

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 694 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine how many times first, second, and third-year students would be present on campus together over a specified number of days, given their respective arrival intervals. The key concept involved calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals (x, y, z) to find out when all students would be on campus simultaneously.

The solution involved defining helper functions to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM, followed by a main function to read input values and compute the total number of occurrences based on the LCM. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and modular arithmetic to achieve the desired results.

The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against the provided test case. No unexpected errors occurred during the process, and the solution was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints. The use of integer division ensured that the results were accurate without any floating-point issues. 

Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of understanding number theory concepts like GCD and LCM in solving problems related to periodic events. The code snippet for future reference is as follows:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        temp = b
        b = a % b
        a = temp
    return a

    return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The MarkiT online virtual market startup wants to organize its grand opening in NIT Patna.
but they want maximum crowd for their inauguration. So the manager told  this  to Praveen a student in NITP who suggested them:
The first-year students come to campus  every x hour,
Second-year students come to campus every y hour,
Third-year students come to campus every z hour and 
Fourth-year is very busy so they don't come regularly.
So Praveen being very clever told him the no of times in n days he can have an audience of all year student (1st,2nd & 3rd) at max. So can you code what Praveen has done?

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a 2 line of input, first line contain one  integers $N$ (No of Days). 
-Next line contain 3 space separated integer the  value of x y z

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line answer the no of times audience consists of all year.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^8$
- $1 \leq x,y,z \leq 10^5$

-----Sample Input:-----
1
10
8 10 6

-----Sample Output:-----
2

-----EXPLANATION:-----
First favourable condition will come on 5th day and Second on 10th day.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 694 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to determine how many times all first, second, and third-year students will be present on campus together over a given number of days. Each year of students comes to campus at different intervals (x, y, z hours). We need to find out how many times these intervals align within the specified number of days.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals (x, y, z). The LCM will give us the time in hours when all three groups of students will be on campus together. Once we have the LCM, we can calculate how many times this LCM fits into the total hours available in N days (which is N * 24 hours). The result will be the number of times all students are present together.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function gcd(a, b):
       while b is not 0:
           temp = b
           b = a mod b
           a = temp
       return a

   function lcm(a, b):
       return (a * b) / gcd(a, b)

   function lcm_of_three(x, y, z):
       return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)

   function count_audience(N, x, y, z):
       total_hours = N * 24
       lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
       return total_hours // lcm_value

   main function:
       read T
       for each testcase:
           read N

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution

INFO - [Task id] 694 [generation text] The official solution effectively calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of three integers (x, y, z) using a helper function to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD). The approach is straightforward and leverages the relationship between GCD and LCM, which is given by the formula:

\[ \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \]

Key insights from the official solution include:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The official solution uses a while loop to compute the GCD, which is a standard method (Euclidean algorithm). This is efficient and ensures that the GCD is computed correctly.

2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM is calculated in a stepwise manner, first finding the LCM of x and y, and then using that result to find the LCM with z. This modular approach simplifies the problem.

3. **Input Handling**: The solution reads the number of test cases and processes each case in a loop, which is a common pattern in competitive programming.

4. **Efficiency**: The solution is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity, as it only uses a few variables and performs a constant amount of work for each test case.

In contrast, my initial solution was similar in logic but could have been more concise. I also used a separate function for LCM, which is fine, but the official solution integrates the GCD and LCM calculations more seamlessly. Additionally, I used integer division directly in the return statement, while the official solution does this in the print statement, which is a minor stylistic difference.

Overall, the official solution is clear and efficient, and it reinforces the importance of using established algorithms like the Euclidean algorithm for GCD in problems involving LCM.
