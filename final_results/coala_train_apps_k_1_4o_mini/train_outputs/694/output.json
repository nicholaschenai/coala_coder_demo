    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The task is to determine how many times all first, second, and third-year students will be present on campus together over a given number of days. Each year of students comes to campus at different intervals (x, y, z hours). We need to find out how many times these intervals align within the specified number of days.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals (x, y, z). The LCM will give us the time in hours when all three groups of students will be on campus together. Once we have the LCM, we can calculate how many times this LCM fits into the total hours available in N days (which is N * 24 hours). The result will be the number of times all students are present together.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function gcd(a, b):\n       while b is not 0:\n           temp = b\n           b = a mod b\n           a = temp\n       return a\n\n   function lcm(a, b):\n       return (a * b) / gcd(a, b)\n\n   function lcm_of_three(x, y, z):\n       return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)\n\n   function count_audience(N, x, y, z):\n       total_hours = N * 24\n       lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n       return total_hours // lcm_value\n\n   main function:\n       read T\n       for each testcase:\n           read N\n           read x, y, z\n           result = count_audience(N, x, y, z)\n           print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    # Function to compute the greatest common divisor\n    while b != 0:\n        temp = b\n        b = a % b\n        a = temp\n    return a\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    # Function to compute the least common multiple\n    return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)\n\ndef lcm_of_three(x, y, z):\n    # Function to compute the LCM of three numbers\n    return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)\n\ndef count_audience(N, x, y, z):\n    # Calculate total hours in N days\n    total_hours = N * 24\n    # Calculate the LCM of x, y, z\n    lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n    # Return the number of times all students are present together\n    return total_hours // lcm_value\n\n# Main function to read input and output results\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())\n    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())\n    result = count_audience(N, x, y, z)\n    print(result)\n```",
