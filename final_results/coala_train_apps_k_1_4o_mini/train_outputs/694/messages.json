Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the question if they fall within a specified roll number range. \n\n    The approach involved initializing a list of scores for all students, processing each question to update the scores based on the given range and complexity, and finally calculating the mean score.

For instance, universities planning events for students from various years can use this approach to determine optimal times for gatherings. Additionally, businesses or organizations that rely on the presence of specific groups at certain intervals can apply this method to enhance participation in their activities. It can also be beneficial in logistics and scheduling problems where multiple parties have different availability cycles."
