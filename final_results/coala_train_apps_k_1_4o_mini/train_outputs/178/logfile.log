INFO - [Task id] 178 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the length of the longest subsequence in a given list of integers where the subsequence is strictly increasing. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will maintain an array where each element at index `i` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. We will iterate through the list and for each element, check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence. If they can, we will update our current element's length based on the maximum length found from the previous elements.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function lengthOfLIS(nums):
       if nums is empty:
           return 0
       
       create an array dp of the same length as nums, initialized to 1
       max_length = 1
       
       for i from 1 to length of nums - 1:
           for j from 0 to i - 1:
               if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                   dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
           max_length = max(max_length, dp[i])

    Title: Longest increasing subsequence
    Part: 1/3
    # Longest increasing subsequence

    We are given an array with $n$ numbers: $a[0 \dots n-1]$.
    The task is to find the longest, strictly increasing, subsequence in $a$.

    Formally we look for the longest sequence of indices $i_1, \dots i_k$ such that

    $$i_1 < i_2 < \dots < i_k,\quad
    a[i_1] < a[i_2] < \dots < a[i_k]$$

    In this article we discuss multiple algorithms for solving this task.
    Also we will discuss some other problems, that can be reduced to this problem.

    ## Solution in $O(n^2)$ with dynamic programming {data-toc-label="Solution in O(n^2) with dynamic programming"}

    Dynamic programming is a very general technique that allows to solve a huge class of problems.
    Here we apply the technique for our specific task.

    First we will search only for the **length** of the longest increasing subsequence, and only later learn how to restore the subsequence itself.

    ### Finding the length

    To accomplish this task, we define an array $d[0 \dots n-1]$, where $d[i]$ is the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends in the element at index $i$.

    !!! example

        $$\begin{array}{ll}
        a &= \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\} \\
        d &= \{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\}
        \end{array}$$

        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\{3, 4, 5\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\}$ or $\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\{0, 1\}$ having length 2.

    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.
    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.

    So let the current index be $i$.
    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.
    Then there are two options:

    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.

    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.

        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.
        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.

        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.
        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.
  
        $$d[i] = \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)$$

    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:

    $$d[i] = \max\left(1, \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)\right)$$

    ### Implementation

    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}
    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i])
                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            ans = max(ans, d[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    ```

    ### Restoring the subsequence

    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.

    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.
    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.
    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.
    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.

    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.

    ### Implementation of restoring

    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.
    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.

    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.
    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}
    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i] && d[i] < d[j] + 1) {
                    d[i] = d[j] + 1;
                    p[i] = j;
                }
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0], pos = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (d[i] > ans) {
                ans = d[i];
                pos = i;
            }
        }

        vector<int> subseq;
        while (pos != -1) {
            subseq.push_back(a[pos]);
            pos = p[pos];
        }
        reverse(subseq.begin(), subseq.end());
        return subseq;
    }

INFO - [Task id] 178 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: We need to find the length of the longest subsequence in a given list of integers where the subsequence is strictly increasing. A subsequence is formed by deleting some elements from the array without changing the order of the remaining elements.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We will create an array `d` where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. We will iterate through the array and for each element, check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing sequence with the current element. The maximum value in the `d` array will give us the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function lengthOfLIS(nums):
       n = length of nums
       if n is 0:
           return 0
       create an array d of size n and initialize all elements to 1
       for i from 1 to n-1:
           for j from 0 to i-1:
               if nums[j] < nums[i]:

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 178 [generation text] The task was to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted array of integers. The solution involved using dynamic programming to build an array that tracks the length of the LIS ending at each index. The core concept was to compare each element with all previous elements to determine if they could form an increasing sequence.

The implemented algorithm runs in O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for this problem. The approach involved initializing a list `d` where each element starts with a value of 1 (indicating that the minimum LIS length for any single element is 1). The nested loops then updated this list based on comparisons between elements.

The final code snippet is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        d = [1] * n
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
        
        return max(d)
```

This solution was effective and passed the provided test case, demonstrating a solid understanding of dynamic programming principles. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation.

                     left = mid + 1
             return left
         for i in range(1,len(nums)):
             if nums[i] > res[-1]:
                 res.append(nums[i])
             else:
                 res[binarySearch(res,nums[i])] = nums[i]
         return len(res)


INFO - [Task id] 178 [generation text] The official solution employs a more efficient approach to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) using a combination of dynamic programming and binary search, achieving a time complexity of O(n log n). This is a significant improvement over the O(n^2) complexity of my initial solution.

Key insights from the official solution:

1. **Initialization**: The solution starts by checking if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns 0. It initializes a list `res` to keep track of the smallest tail values of increasing subsequences found so far.

2. **Binary Search**: A helper function `binarySearch` is defined to find the position in the `res` list where the current number should be placed. This function uses a binary search algorithm to efficiently find the correct index, ensuring that the `res` list remains sorted.

3. **Iterating through the input**: The solution iterates through the input list starting from the second element. If the current number is greater than the last element in `res`, it appends the number to `res`. Otherwise, it uses the `binarySearch` function to find the appropriate index to replace an existing value in `res`, maintaining the potential for future increasing subsequences.

4. **Final Result**: The length of the `res` list at the end of the iteration represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

This approach is more efficient because it reduces the number of comparisons needed to maintain the increasing subsequence, leveraging the properties of sorted lists and binary search. In contrast, my initial solution involved nested loops, leading to a higher time complexity. 

Overall, the official solution's use of binary search to maintain a dynamic list of potential subsequence tails is a valuable technique that can be applied to similar problems in the future.
