    "summary": "In this task, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series defined as 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, etc. Initially, I misidentified the formula for generating the series, which led to incorrect outputs. The series is generated by the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ T(N) = \\frac{(N-1) \\cdot N \\cdot (2(N-1) + 1)}{6} \\]\n\nThis formula derives from the known formula for the sum of the first k squares.\n\nThe initial approach incorrectly used a different formula, resulting in outputs that did not match the expected results. After analyzing the series and identifying the correct pattern, I revised the code to implement the correct formula, which successfully passed all test cases.\n\nThe final working code is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef find_nth_number(N):\n    if N == 1:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return ((N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1)) // 6\n\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())\n    result = find_nth_number(N)\n    print(result)\n```\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring the correct mathematical formulas are applied.",
    "reflection": "In this exercise, I learned the importance of correctly identifying the mathematical patterns in sequences. Initially, I miscalculated the formula for the N'th term in the series, which led to incorrect outputs. The official solution provided a more straightforward approach by adjusting the index and using a simplified formula for the sum of squares.\n\nKey insights from the official solution include:\n1. **Index Adjustment**: The official solution effectively adjusts the index by subtracting 2 from N when calculating the term. This adjustment simplifies the computation and aligns with the series' structure.\n2. **Formula for Sum of Squares**: The formula used in the official solution is derived from the sum of the first k squares, which is efficient and directly applicable to the problem.\n3. **Output Handling**: The official solution ensures that the output is formatted correctly by converting the result to an integer before printing.\n\nOverall, the official solution is efficient and concise, demonstrating a clear understanding of the mathematical properties of the series. This experience reinforced the need to carefully analyze and derive formulas when working with sequences and series.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: find_nth_number]\nThis function calculates the N'th number in a specific mathematical series, returning 0 for the first number. For any subsequent number, it employs a formula that computes the sum of the squares of the first (N-1) integers.
