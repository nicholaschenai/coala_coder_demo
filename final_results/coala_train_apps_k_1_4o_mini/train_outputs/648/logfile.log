- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
- 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
- -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

-----Example-----
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2
2 3 4 -1
1 1 2

Output:
3
4

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a series of hills, each with a specific height. Participants in a competition will jump from one hill to another based on certain rules. They can either query where they will end up after a series of jumps or modify the heights of a range of hills. The jumps can only go to the nearest hill to the right that is taller, and if there are no such hills within a distance of 100, they stay on the current hill.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will maintain a list of hill heights.
   - For each query of type 1, we will start from the specified hill and attempt to jump up to `k` times, checking the heights of the hills to the right to find the next valid jump.
   - For each query of type 2, we will update the heights of the specified range of hills by adding a given value.
   - We need to ensure that the jumps respect the distance constraint of 100 hills.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize a list of hill heights from input
   For each operation:
       If operation type is 1:
           Set current position to i-1 (0-indexed)
           For j from 0 to k-1:
               Find the next hill to jump to:
                   For each hill from current position + 1 to current position + 100:
                       If hill index is out of bounds, break
                       If height of hill is greater than height of current position:
                           Update current position to this hill index
                           Break
               If no valid jump found, break
           Output the final position (current position + 1 for 1-indexing)
       Else if operation type is 2:
           Update the heights of hills from L-1 to R-1 by adding X
   ```

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
- 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
- -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

-----Example-----
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2
2 3 4 -1
1 1 2

Output:
3
4

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        In ChefLand, there is a mountain range consisting of $N$ hills (numbered $1$ through $N$) in a straight line. Let's denote the height of the $i$-th hill from the left by $h_i$.
        Ada is working on the water supply system of ChefLand. On some of the hills, she wants to place water reservoirs; then, for each reservoir, she will decide in which direction the water should flow from it â€” either to the left or to the right (water may not flow in both directions from the same reservoir). From a reservoir on a hill with height $h$, water flows in the chosen direction until it reaches the first hill that is strictly higher than $h$; all hills before this hill (including the hill containing the reservoir) are therefore supplied with water.
        For example, suppose we have hills with heights $[7, 2, 3, 5, 8]$. If we place a reservoir on the hill with height $5$, and pump water from it to the left, then the hills with heights $2$, $3$ and $5$ are supplied with water.
        Help Ada find the minimum numer of reservoirs needed to provide water to all the hills if she chooses the directions optimally.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
        - The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.
        - The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $h_1, h_2, \dots, h_N$.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum required number of reservoirs.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $2 \le N \le 10^5$
        - $1 \le h_i \le 10^9$ for each valid $i$
        - $h_i \neq h_j $ for any valid $i \neq j$
        - the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$

        -----Example Input-----
        1
        6
        4 16 32 6 8 2

        -----Example Output-----
        2    

        -----Explanation-----
        Example case 1: We can place reservoirs on the second and third hill, pumping water to the left and right respectively.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
           We have a series of hills, each with a unique height. We need to determine the minimum number of water reservoirs required to supply water to all the hills. Water can flow from a reservoir in one direction until it reaches a taller hill, which means we can strategically place reservoirs to cover as many hills as possible.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
           To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of hills and determine the optimal placement of reservoirs. We can keep track of the highest hill encountered so far as we move from left to right and from right to left. If a hill is taller than the highest hill we've seen in the current direction, we will need to place a reservoir there. By doing this in both directions, we can ensure that all hills are supplied with water while minimizing the number of reservoirs.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function min_reservoirs(hills):
               left_max = -1
               right_max = -1
               reservoirs = 0
       
               for each hill from left to right:
                   if hill height > left_max:
                       left_max = hill height
                       reservoirs += 1
       
               for each hill from right to left:
                   if hill height > right_max:
                       right_max = hill height
                       reservoirs += 1
       
               return reservoirs
       
           read number of test cases T
           for each test case:
               read N
               read heights of hills
               print min_reservoirs(heights)
           ```

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We have a series of hills, each with a specific height. Participants in a competition will jump from one hill to another based on certain rules. They start at a specified hill and can jump to the nearest hill to the right that is taller. If there are no such hills within a distance of 100, they stay on their current hill. We need to implement a program that can handle two types of operations: one that determines where a participant will end up after a series of jumps, and another that modifies the heights of a range of hills.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we will maintain a list of hill heights and process each operation accordingly. For Type 1 operations, we will simulate the jumps by checking the heights of the hills to the right of the starting hill. For Type 2 operations, we will update the heights of the specified range of hills. We need to ensure that the jumps are only made to hills that are strictly taller and within a distance of 100.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function jump_to_hill(heights, start_index, jumps):
       current_index = start_index
       for each jump in range(jumps):
           next_index = current_index + 1
           while next_index <= N and (next_index - current_index) <= 100:
               if heights[next_index] > heights[current_index]:

           if next_index > N or (next_index - current_index) > 100:
               break
       return current_index

   function update_heights(heights, L, R, X):
       for i in range(L, R + 1):
           heights[i] += X

   read N and Q
   read heights
   for each operation:
       if operation type is 1:
           read i and k
           output jump_to_hill(heights, i - 1, k)
       else if operation type is 2:
           read L, R, X
           update_heights(heights, L - 1, R - 1, X)

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   We have a series of hills, each with a specific height. Participants in a competition will jump from one hill to another based on certain rules. They start at a specified hill and can jump to the nearest hill to the right that is taller. If there are no such hills within a distance of 100, they stay on their current hill. We need to implement a program that can handle two types of operations: one that determines where a participant will end up after a series of jumps, and another that modifies the heights of a range of hills.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we will maintain a list of hill heights and process each operation accordingly. For Type 1 operations, we will simulate the jumps by checking the heights of the hills to the right of the starting hill. For Type 2 operations, we will update the heights of the specified range of hills. We need to ensure that the jumps are only made to hills that are strictly taller and within a distance of 100.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function jump_to_hill(heights, start_index, jumps):
       current_index = start_index
       for each jump in range(jumps):
           next_index = current_index + 1

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
- 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
- -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

-----Example-----
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2
2 3 4 -1
1 1 2

Output:
3
4

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] In this task, I implemented a solution for a hill jumping competition problem where participants jump from one hill to another based on height constraints. The problem required handling two types of operations: determining the final hill after a series of jumps and updating the heights of a range of hills.

The core concepts involved were:
1. **Simulating Jumps**: For Type 1 operations, I created a function to simulate the jumps by checking the heights of the hills to the right of the starting hill. The jumps were constrained by the requirement that the next hill must be strictly taller and within a distance of 100.
2. **Updating Heights**: For Type 2 operations, I implemented a straightforward function to update the heights of a specified range of hills.

The solution was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints (up to 100,000 hills and operations) due to the linear nature of the operations. I ensured to maintain 1-based indexing for output as required by the problem statement.

The final code was structured with helper functions for clarity, and I made sure to follow the specified format for input and output. The implementation passed all provided test cases, confirming its correctness. 

Key takeaway: The problem reinforced the importance of efficiently managing state changes (like height updates) and simulating conditions (like jumps) in competitive programming scenarios.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem by maintaining a straightforward approach to both types of operations. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:

1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of hills (`n`) and the number of operations (`q`). It then initializes a list to store the final results and reads the initial heights of the hills.

2. **Operation Processing**: The solution uses a loop to process each operation. It distinguishes between Type 1 and Type 2 operations based on the first element of the input for each operation.

3. **Type 1 Operation (Jumping)**:
   - The starting hill index is adjusted to be zero-based.
   - A nested loop is used to perform the jumps. It checks the next hills within a distance of 100 to find the nearest hill that is strictly taller.
   - If a taller hill is found, the current index is updated, and the loop continues for the specified number of jumps.
   - The final position is stored in a results list, adjusting back to a one-based index for output.

4. **Type 2 Operation (Height Update)**:
   - This operation directly updates the heights of the specified range of hills by iterating through the indices and applying the height change.

5. **Output**: Finally, the results of all Type 1 operations are printed in sequence.

### Key Takeaways:
- The official solution is efficient in terms of both time and space, as it processes each operation in a straightforward manner without unnecessary complexity.
- The use of a single list to store heights and results simplifies the implementation.
- The approach to handle jumps by checking the next hills in a loop is effective, ensuring that the constraints are respected.

This experience reinforces the importance of clear and efficient input handling, as well as the need to maintain simplicity in logic when dealing with multiple operations on data structures.

The main function is `update_heights`.
INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] The function modifies the heights of a specified range of hills by adding a given value to each hill's height within that range. It takes three parameters: the list of hill heights, the starting index, and the ending index of the range to be updated, along with the value to be added. The function iterates through the specified range and increments each hill's height by the provided value. This allows for batch updates to the heights of multiple hills in a single operation. The changes are applied directly to the original list of heights. The function does not return any value, as it updates the list in place.

[Problem]
    Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
    Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
    Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
    Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
    Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

    -----Input-----
    - First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
    - Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
    - Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

    -----Output-----
    For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
    - 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
    - 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
    - -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
    - 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

    -----Subtasks-----
    - Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
    - Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

    -----Example-----
    Input:
    5 3
    1 2 3 4 5
    1 1 2
    2 3 4 -1
    1 1 2

    Output:
    3
    4

    -----Explanation-----
    The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
    The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
    The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.
