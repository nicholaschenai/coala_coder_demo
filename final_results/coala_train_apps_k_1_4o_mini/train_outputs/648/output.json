    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   We have a series of hills, each with a specific height. Participants in a competition will jump from one hill to another based on certain rules. They start at a specified hill and can jump to the nearest hill to the right that is taller. If there are no such hills within a distance of 100, they stay on their current hill. We need to implement a program that can handle two types of operations: one that determines where a participant will end up after a series of jumps, and another that modifies the heights of a range of hills.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we will maintain a list of hill heights and process each operation accordingly. For Type 1 operations, we will simulate the jumps by checking the heights of the hills to the right of the starting hill. For Type 2 operations, we will update the heights of the specified range of hills. We need to ensure that the jumps are only made to hills that are strictly taller and within a distance of 100.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function jump_to_hill(heights, start_index, jumps):\n       current_index = start_index\n       for each jump in range(jumps):\n           next_index = current_index + 1\n           while next_index <= N and (next_index - current_index) <= 100:\n               if heights[next_index] > heights[current_index]:\n                   current_index = next_index\n                   break\n               next_index += 1\n           if next_index > N or (next_index - current_index) > 100:\n               break\n       return current_index\n\n   function update_heights(heights, L, R, X):\n       for i in range(L, R + 1):\n           heights[i] += X\n\n   read N and Q\n   read heights\n   for each operation:\n       if operation type is 1:\n           read i and k\n           output jump_to_hill(heights, i - 1, k)\n       else if operation type is 2:\n           read L, R, X\n           update_heights(heights, L - 1, R - 1, X)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef jump_to_hill(heights, start_index, jumps):\n    # Initialize the current index to the starting hill\n    current_index = start_index\n    # Perform the jumps\n    for _ in range(jumps):\n        next_index = current_index + 1\n        # Look for the next hill that is strictly higher\n        while next_index < len(heights) and (next_index - current_index) <= 100:\n            if heights[next_index] > heights[current_index]:\n                current_index = next_index\n                break\n            next_index += 1\n        # If no valid next hill is found, break the loop\n        if next_index >= len(heights) or (next_index - current_index) > 100:\n            break\n    return current_index + 1  # Return 1-based index\n\ndef update_heights(heights, L, R, X):\n    # Update the heights of the hills from L to R\n    for i in range(L, R + 1):\n        heights[i] += X\n\n# Read number of hills and operations\nN, Q = map(int, input().split())\n# Read the initial heights of the hills\nheights = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Process each operation\nfor _ in range(Q):\n    operation = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    if operation[0] == 1:  # Type 1 operation\n        i, k = operation[1], operation[2]\n        # Output the result of the jump operation\n        print(jump_to_hill(heights, i - 1, k))\n    elif operation[0] == 2:  # Type 2 operation\n        L, R, X = operation[1], operation[2], operation[3]\n        # Update the heights of the specified range\n        update_heights(heights, L - 1, R - 1, X)\n```",
