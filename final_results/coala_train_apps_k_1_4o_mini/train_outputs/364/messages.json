The key concept involved calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals (x, y, z) to find out when all students would be on campus simultaneously.\n\n    The solution involved defining helper functions to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM, followed by a main function to read input values and compute the total number of occurrences based on the LCM. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and modular arithmetic to achieve the desired results.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against the provided test case. No unexpected errors occurred during the process, and the solution was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints. The use of integer division ensured that the results were accurate without any floating-point issues. \n\n    Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of understanding number theory concepts like GCD and LCM in solving problems related to periodic events.

        "content": "The official solution provides a more comprehensive approach to the problem of measuring water with two jugs. Here are the key insights and steps distilled from the official solution:\n\n1. **Initial Checks**: The solution first checks if the desired amount of water (z) is within the valid range. Specifically, it ensures that z is non-negative and does not exceed the total capacity of both jugs (x + y). This is a crucial step to quickly eliminate impossible cases.\n\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution accounts for the scenario where one of the jugs has a capacity of zero. If x is zero, it checks if z is equal to the capacity of the other jug (y) or zero itself. This is an important edge case that simplifies the logic.\n\n3. **GCD Calculation**: Instead of directly using the GCD of x and y, the solution employs a modified approach to find the GCD through a loop, which is more efficient in terms of handling the values of a and b. This is done by repeatedly applying the modulus operation until one of the values becomes zero.\n\n4. **Final Check**: The solution concludes by checking if z is a multiple of the GCD (m) found in the previous step. This is based on the mathematical property that any measurable amount using the two jugs must be a multiple of their GCD.\n\nOverall, the official solution is more robust and handles edge cases effectively, ensuring that all possible scenarios are considered. My initial approach was simpler but did not account for all edge cases, particularly when one jug has a capacity of zero or when z exceeds the total capacity. The official solution's method of checking the GCD and its relationship with z is also more thorough, providing a clearer path to the solution."
