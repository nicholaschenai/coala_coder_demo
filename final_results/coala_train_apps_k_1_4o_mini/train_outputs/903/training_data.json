    "summary": "In this task, the goal was to determine the x-coordinate of a mirror placed on the x-axis so that Kabir can see Tara's reflection. The solution involved using the properties of similar triangles to derive the formula for the mirror's position. The formula used was:\n\n\\[ \\text{mirror\\_x} = \\frac{x1 \\cdot y2 + x2 \\cdot y1}{y1 + y2} \\]\n\nThis formula effectively calculates the x-coordinate based on the positions of Kabir and Tara.\n\nThe implementation involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to extract the coordinates, and then applying the formula to compute the mirror's position. The output was formatted to two decimal places to meet the precision requirement.\n\nThe code was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was correct. No unexpected errors occurred during the implementation, and the solution adhered to the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement. \n\nOverall, this experience reinforced the importance of understanding geometric relationships in problems involving reflections and projections.",
    "reflection": "The official solution provides a different approach to solving the problem of finding the mirror's position. It uses the concept of linear equations to derive the x-coordinate of the mirror based on the coordinates of Kabir and Tara. \n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n1. **Reflection Concept**: The solution reflects Tara's position across the x-axis by negating her y-coordinate. This allows the problem to be framed in terms of a line equation.\n  \n2. **Line Equation**: The slope (m) of the line connecting Kabir and Tara is calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{(q[1] - p[1])}{(q[0] - p[0])}\n   \\]\n   where \\(p\\) is Kabir's position and \\(q\\) is Tara's position.\n\n3. **Intercept Calculation**: The y-intercept (c) of the line is calculated using the point-slope form of the line equation:\n   \\[\n   c = p[1] - m \\cdot p[0]\n   \\]\n\n4. **Mirror Position**: The x-coordinate of the mirror is derived from the equation of the line when y = 0 (the x-axis):\n   \\[\n   x = -\\frac{c}{m}\n   \\]\n   This gives the position where the mirror should be placed.\n\n### Comparison with My Approach:\n- My approach used the concept of similar triangles to derive the mirror's position, which is valid but less direct than using linear equations.\n- The official solution is more concise and leverages the properties of lines, making it easier to understand and implement.\n- The official solution also handles input and output formatting more effectively, ensuring the result is printed with the required precision.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe official solution's method of using linear equations is a more straightforward approach to this problem. It emphasizes the importance of understanding geometric relationships and how they can be translated into algebraic equations. This experience highlights the value of exploring different mathematical perspectives when solving programming problems.",
