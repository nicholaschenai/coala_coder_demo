INFO - [Task id] 903 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to determine the position on the x-axis (the front wall of the classroom) where a mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's smile. Kabir and Tara are positioned at given coordinates in a 2D space, and we need to calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror based on their positions.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the position of the mirror, we can use the concept of reflection. The mirror's position on the x-axis should be such that the angle of incidence (the angle at which Kabir's line of sight hits the mirror) is equal to the angle of reflection (the angle at which the light reflects towards Tara). This can be calculated using the formula derived from the geometry of the situation. The x-coordinate of the mirror can be found using the formula:
   \[
   x_{mirror} = \frac{x1 + x2}{2} - \frac{(y1 - y2) \cdot (x1 - x2)}{2 \cdot (y1 + y2)}
   \]
   This formula takes into account the positions of Kabir and Tara and gives us the correct x-coordinate for the mirror.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_mirror_position(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read x1, y1
           read x2, y2
           calculate x_mirror using the formula
           store x_mirror in results
       return results
   ```

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine if there are two zebras in a jungle that spit at each other based on their positions and spit distances. The solution involved using a dictionary to map each zebra's position to the position it spits at. The core concept was to check for reciprocal spitting, meaning if zebra A spits at zebra B, then zebra B should also spit back at zebra A.

    The approach was straightforward: first, populate a dictionary with each zebra's spit target, and then check if any zebra's spit target points back to its original position. This method efficiently checks for the required condition in linear time.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against the provided test case. The solution was effective, and no unexpected errors occurred during the process. The key takeaway is the utility of using a dictionary for quick lookups, which is essential for problems involving relationships between elements. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def find_zebras(t, zebras):
        spit_map = {}
        for i in range(t):
            a, b = zebras[i]
            spit_map[a] = a + b
    
        for i in range(t):
            a, b = zebras[i]
            target_position = a + b
            if target_position in spit_map and spit_map[target_position] == a:
                print("YES")
                return
    
        print("NO")

    t = int(input())
    zebras = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine the x-coordinate of a mirror placed on the x-axis so that Kabir can see Tara's reflection. The solution involved using the properties of similar triangles to derive the formula for the mirror's position. The formula used was:

\[ \text{mirror\_x} = \frac{x1 \cdot y2 + x2 \cdot y1}{y1 + y2} \]

This formula effectively calculates the x-coordinate based on the positions of Kabir and Tara.

The implementation involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to extract the coordinates, and then applying the formula to compute the mirror's position. The output was formatted to two decimal places to meet the precision requirement.

The code was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was correct. No unexpected errors occurred during the implementation, and the solution adhered to the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement. 

Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of understanding geometric relationships in problems involving reflections and projections.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to determine the position on the x-axis (the front wall of a classroom) where a mirror should be placed so that Kabir, who is sitting at a certain coordinate (x1, y1), can see Tara, who is sitting at another coordinate (x2, y2). The mirror will reflect Tara's position to Kabir's line of sight.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the position of the mirror, we need to calculate the x-coordinate where the reflection of Tara's position would meet the line of sight from Kabir. The mirror's position can be determined using the concept of similar triangles. The y-coordinate of the mirror will be 0 (since it lies on the x-axis), and we can use the properties of similar triangles to derive the x-coordinate of the mirror.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_mirror_position(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read x1, y1
           read x2, y2
           # Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror
           mirror_x = (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)
           print mirror_x
       
   read T
   test_cases = []
   for i from 1 to T:
       read x1, y1
       read x2, y2
       add (x1, y1, x2, y2) to test_cases
       
   find_mirror_position(T, test_cases)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def find_mirror_position(T, test_cases):
    # Iterate through each test case
    for x1, y1, x2, y2 in test_cases:
        # Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror using the formula derived from similar triangles

- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

INFO - [Task id] 903 [generation text] The official solution provides a different approach to solving the problem of finding the mirror's position. It uses the concept of linear equations to derive the x-coordinate of the mirror based on the coordinates of Kabir and Tara. 

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:
1. **Reflection Concept**: The solution reflects Tara's position across the x-axis by negating her y-coordinate. This allows the problem to be framed in terms of a line equation.
  
2. **Line Equation**: The slope (m) of the line connecting Kabir and Tara is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   m = \frac{(q[1] - p[1])}{(q[0] - p[0])}
   \]
   where \(p\) is Kabir's position and \(q\) is Tara's position.

3. **Intercept Calculation**: The y-intercept (c) of the line is calculated using the point-slope form of the line equation:
   \[
   c = p[1] - m \cdot p[0]
   \]

4. **Mirror Position**: The x-coordinate of the mirror is derived from the equation of the line when y = 0 (the x-axis):
   \[
   x = -\frac{c}{m}
   \]
   This gives the position where the mirror should be placed.

### Comparison with My Approach:
- My approach used the concept of similar triangles to derive the mirror's position, which is valid but less direct than using linear equations.
- The official solution is more concise and leverages the properties of lines, making it easier to understand and implement.
- The official solution also handles input and output formatting more effectively, ensuring the result is printed with the required precision.

### Conclusion:
The official solution's method of using linear equations is a more straightforward approach to this problem. It emphasizes the importance of understanding geometric relationships and how they can be translated into algebraic equations. This experience highlights the value of exploring different mathematical perspectives when solving programming problems.
INFO - Updated entry: In this task, the goal was to determine the x-coordinate of a mirror placed on the x-axis so that Kabir can see Tara's reflection. The solution involved using the properties of similar triangles to derive the formula for the mirror's position. The formula used was:
