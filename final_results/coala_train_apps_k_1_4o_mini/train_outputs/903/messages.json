Kabir and Tara are positioned at given coordinates in a 2D space, and we need to calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror based on their positions.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To find the position of the mirror, we can use the concept of reflection. The mirror's position on the x-axis should be such that the angle of incidence (the angle at which Kabir's line of sight hits the mirror) is equal to the angle of reflection (the angle at which the light reflects towards Tara). This can be calculated using the formula derived from the geometry of the situation. The x-coordinate of the mirror can be found using the formula:\n   \\[\n   x_{mirror} = \\frac{x1 + x2}{2} - \\frac{(y1 - y2) \\cdot (x1 - x2)}{2 \\cdot (y1 + y2)}\n   \\]\n   This formula takes into account the positions of Kabir and Tara and gives us the correct x-coordinate for the mirror.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function find_mirror_position(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read x1, y1\n           read x2, y2\n           calculate x_mirror using the formula\n           store x_mirror in results\n       return results\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef find_mirror_position(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        # Read Kabir's coordinates\n        x1, y1 = test_cases[i][0]\n        # Read Tara's coordinates\n        x2, y2 = test_cases[i][1]\n        \n        # Calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror using the derived formula\n        x_mirror = (x1 + x2) / 2 - ((y1 - y2) * (x1 - x2)) / (2 * (y1 + y2))\n        \n        # Store the result formatted to 2 decimal places\n        results.append(f\"{x_mirror:.2f}\")\n    \n    # Print all results, each on a new line\n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\n# Read input\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\n\nfor _ in range(T):\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n    test_cases.append(((x1, y1), (x2, y2)))\n\n# Call the function with the number of test cases and the test cases\nfind_mirror_position(T, test_cases)\n```"

The solution involved using a dictionary to map each zebra's position to the position it spits at. The core concept was to check for reciprocal spitting, meaning if zebra A spits at zebra B, then zebra B should also spit back at zebra A.\n\n    The approach was straightforward: first, populate a dictionary with each zebra's spit target, and then check if any zebra's spit target points back to its original position. This method efficiently checks for the required condition in linear time.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against the provided test case. The solution was effective, and no unexpected errors occurred during the process. The key takeaway is the utility of using a dictionary for quick lookups, which is essential for problems involving relationships between elements. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_zebras(t, zebras):\n        spit_map = {}\n        for i in range(t):\n            a, b = zebras[i]\n            spit_map[a] = a + b\n    \n        for i in range(t):\n            a, b = zebras[i]\n            target_position = a + b\n            if target_position in spit_map and spit_map[target_position] == a:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                return\n    \n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    t = int(input())\n    zebras = []\n    for _ in range(t):\n        a, b = map(int, input().split())\n        zebras.append((a, b))\n\n    find_zebras(t, zebras)\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"

It uses the concept of linear equations to derive the x-coordinate of the mirror based on the coordinates of Kabir and Tara. \n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n1. **Reflection Concept**: The solution reflects Tara's position across the x-axis by negating her y-coordinate.

It emphasizes the importance of understanding geometric relationships and how they can be translated into algebraic equations. This experience highlights the value of exploring different mathematical perspectives when solving programming problems."
