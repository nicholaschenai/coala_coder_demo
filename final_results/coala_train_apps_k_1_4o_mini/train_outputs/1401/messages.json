Each chocolate has a specific price, and we need to determine the maximum number of chocolates she can buy given a list of prices and a total amount of money she can spend.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - First, sort the list of chocolate prices in ascending order. This way, we can start buying the cheapest chocolates first, which will allow Anushka to maximize the number of chocolates she can buy.\n   - Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of chocolates bought and a variable to keep track of the total money spent.\n   - Iterate through the sorted list of prices, and for each price, check if adding that price to the total spent would exceed the budget. If it does not exceed the budget, add the price to the total spent and increment the counter. If it does exceed the budget, stop the process as we cannot afford any more chocolates.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function max_chocolates(n, k, prices):\n       sort prices in ascending order\n       initialize count = 0\n       initialize total_spent = 0\n       \n       for price in prices:\n           if total_spent + price <= k:\n               total_spent += price\n               count += 1\n           else:\n               break\n       \n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef max_chocolates(n, k, prices):\n    # Step 1: Sort the prices in ascending order\n    prices.sort()\n    \n    # Step 2: Initialize count of chocolates and total money spent\n    count = 0\n    total_spent = 0\n    \n    # Step 3: Iterate through the sorted prices\n    for price in prices:\n        # Step 4: Check if we can afford the current chocolate\n        if total_spent + price <= k:\n            total_spent += price  # Add the price to total spent\n            count += 1            # Increment the count of chocolates bought\n        else:\n            break  # Stop if we can't afford the next chocolate\n    \n    # Step 5: Return the total count of chocolates bought\n    return count\n\n# Reading input\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\nprices = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Output the result\nprint(max_chocolates(n, k, prices))\n```"
