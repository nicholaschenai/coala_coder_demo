    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   Anushka wants to buy as many chocolates as possible with a limited amount of money. Each chocolate has a price, and she needs to choose the chocolates in such a way that the total cost does not exceed her budget.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To maximize the number of chocolates Anushka can buy, we should first sort the list of chocolate prices in ascending order. This way, we can start buying the cheapest chocolates first until we run out of money. We will keep a count of how many chocolates she can buy as we iterate through the sorted list and subtract the prices from her budget.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function maxChocolates(prices, k):\n       sort prices in ascending order\n       count = 0\n       total_spent = 0\n       \n       for price in prices:\n           if total_spent + price <= k:\n               total_spent += price\n               count += 1\n           else:\n               break\n       \n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef maxChocolates(prices, k):\n    # Sort the prices in ascending order\n    prices.sort()\n    \n    count = 0  # Initialize the count of chocolates bought\n    total_spent = 0  # Initialize the total amount spent\n    \n    # Iterate through the sorted prices\n    for price in prices:\n        # Check if adding this chocolate's price exceeds the budget\n        if total_spent + price <= k:\n            total_spent += price  # Update the total spent\n            count += 1  # Increment the count of chocolates bought\n        else:\n            break  # Stop if we can't afford the next chocolate\n    \n    return count  # Return the total number of chocolates bought\n```",
