## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains one integer N.
Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

-----Output-----
Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order â€” the indices of potential killers.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ Ri â‰¤ N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.
- It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.

-----Subtasks-----

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef is investigating a murder case involving a mafia organization. Each member of the mafia reports to another member, and there is a single Don who reports to no one (indicated by a reporting value of 0). The task is to identify the members of the mafia who are not reported to by anyone else, as these members are considered potential killers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the potential killers, we need to determine which members of the mafia do not appear as a reporting target for any other member. We can achieve this by:
   - Creating a list to track how many members report to each member.
   - Iterating through the reporting list to populate this tracking list.
   - Finally, we will collect the indices of members who have a count of zero in the tracking list, as these members are not reported to by anyone.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize a list 'report_count' of size N+1 with all zeros
   For each member i from 1 to N:
       If Ri is not 0:
           Increment report_count[Ri] by 1
   Initialize an empty list 'potential_killers'
   For each member i from 1 to N:
       If report_count[i] is 0:
           Append i to potential_killers
   Sort potential_killers
   Print the elements of potential_killers as space-separated integers
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def find_potential_killers():
    # Read the number of members
    N = int(input())
    # Read the reporting structure
    R = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize a list to count how many people report to each member
    report_count = [0] * (N + 1)
    
    # Count the number of reports for each member
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        Ri = R[i - 1]  # R is 0-indexed, members are 1-indexed
        if Ri != 0:
            report_count[Ri] += 1
    
    # Find all members who are not reported to by anyone
    potential_killers = []
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if report_count[i] == 0:
            potential_killers.append(i)
    
    # Sort the potential killers
    potential_killers.sort()
    
    # Print the result as space-separated integers

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine how many times first, second, and third-year students would be present on campus together over a specified number of days, given their respective arrival intervals. The key concept involved calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals (x, y, z) to find out when all students would be on campus simultaneously.

    The solution involved defining helper functions to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM, followed by a main function to read input values and compute the total number of occurrences based on the LCM. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and modular arithmetic to achieve the desired results.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against the provided test case. No unexpected errors occurred during the process, and the solution was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints. The use of integer division ensured that the results were accurate without any floating-point issues. 

    Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of understanding number theory concepts like GCD and LCM in solving problems related to periodic events. The code snippet for future reference is as follows:

    ```python
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b != 0:
            temp = b
            b = a % b
            a = temp
        return a

    def lcm(a, b):
        return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

    def lcm_of_three(x, y, z):
        return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)

    def count_audience(N, x, y, z):
        total_hours = N * 24
        lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
        return total_hours // lcm_value

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
        result = count_audience(N, x, y, z)
        print(result)
    ```

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to identify potential killers in a mafia organization based on a reporting structure. The key insight was that potential killers are members who are not reported to by anyone else. The solution involved counting how many members report to each member and then identifying those with a count of zero.

The approach I took was straightforward:
1. Read the number of members and their reporting relationships.
2. Use a list to track how many members report to each member.
3. Iterate through the reporting list to populate this count.
4. Collect members with a count of zero and sort them for output.

The final implementation was efficient, operating in O(N) time complexity for counting reports and O(N log N) for sorting the potential killers, which is acceptable given the constraints (up to 100,000 members).

The code snippet that encapsulates the solution is as follows:

```python
def find_potential_killers(N, reporting):
    report_count = [0] * (N + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if reporting[i - 1] != 0:
            report_count[reporting[i - 1]] += 1
    
    potential_killers = []
    
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if report_count[i] == 0:
            potential_killers.append(i)
    
    potential_killers.sort()
    return potential_killers

N = int(input())
reporting = list(map(int, input().split()))
result = find_potential_killers(N, reporting)
print(" ".join(map(str, result)))
```

This experience reinforced the importance of understanding hierarchical structures and how to efficiently track relationships within them. The solution was effective and passed all test cases, demonstrating a solid grasp of the problem requirements.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains one integer N.
Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

-----Output-----
Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order â€” the indices of potential killers.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ Ri â‰¤ N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.
- It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem involves identifying potential killers in a mafia organization based on a reporting structure. Each member of the mafia reports to another member, and the Don (the leader) reports to no one. A potential killer is defined as a member who is not reported to by anyone else. We need to find and list these members in ascending order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Read the number of members (N) and their reporting structure (a list of integers where each integer indicates who a member reports to).
   - Create a list to keep track of how many members report to each member.
   - Iterate through the reporting list and count how many members report to each member.
   - Identify members who have a count of zero (meaning no one reports to them).
   - Collect these members' indices, sort them, and print them.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_potential_killers(N, reporting):
       Initialize a list 'report_count' of size N+1 with all zeros
       
       for i from 1 to N:
           if reporting[i-1] != 0:
               report_count[reporting[i-1]] += 1
       
       Initialize an empty list 'potential_killers'
       
       for i from 1 to N:
           if report_count[i] == 0:
               append i to 'potential_killers'
       
       sort 'potential_killers'
       return 'potential_killers'

   Read list of integers reporting
   result = find_potential_killers(N, reporting)

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
n = eval(input())
r = list(map(int, input().split()))

tree = dict()
i = 1
for j in r:
 c = tree.get(j)
 if c:
  tree[j].append(i)
 else:
  tree[j] = [i]
 if not tree.get(i):
  tree[i] = []
 i += 1
s = []
for elem in tree:
 if not tree[elem]:
  s.append(str(elem))
print(' '.join(s))

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] The official solution utilizes a dictionary to represent the reporting structure of the mafia members, which allows for efficient tracking of who reports to whom. This approach is insightful because it directly maps each member to a list of their subordinates, making it easy to identify members who are not reported to by anyone.

Key steps in the official solution:
1. **Input Handling:** It reads the number of members and their reporting relationships.
2. **Tree Construction:** It constructs a dictionary (`tree`) where each key is a member and the value is a list of members that report to them. If a member does not have any subordinates, their list remains empty.
3. **Identifying Potential Killers:** After building the tree, it iterates through the dictionary to find members with an empty list (indicating no one reports to them) and collects their indices.
4. **Output:** Finally, it prints the indices of potential killers as a space-separated string.

This solution is efficient in both time and space, as it only requires a single pass to build the reporting structure and another pass to identify potential killers. My initial approach was also correct but used a list to count reports, which is less intuitive than using a dictionary for this specific problem. The official solution's use of a dictionary simplifies the logic and makes it easier to understand the relationships between members. 

In future problems involving hierarchical structures, considering a dictionary or similar data structure for direct mapping can lead to clearer and more efficient solutions.
