    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The problem involves identifying potential killers in a mafia organization based on a reporting structure. Each member of the mafia reports to another member, and the Don (the leader) reports to no one. A potential killer is defined as a member who is not reported to by anyone else. We need to find and list these members in ascending order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - Read the number of members (N) and their reporting structure (a list of integers where each integer indicates who a member reports to).\n   - Create a list to keep track of how many members report to each member.\n   - Iterate through the reporting list and count how many members report to each member.\n   - Identify members who have a count of zero (meaning no one reports to them).\n   - Collect these members' indices, sort them, and print them.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function find_potential_killers(N, reporting):\n       Initialize a list 'report_count' of size N+1 with all zeros\n       \n       for i from 1 to N:\n           if reporting[i-1] != 0:\n               report_count[reporting[i-1]] += 1\n       \n       Initialize an empty list 'potential_killers'\n       \n       for i from 1 to N:\n           if report_count[i] == 0:\n               append i to 'potential_killers'\n       \n       sort 'potential_killers'\n       return 'potential_killers'\n   \n   Read integer N\n   Read list of integers reporting\n   result = find_potential_killers(N, reporting)\n   print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef find_potential_killers(N, reporting):\n    # Initialize a list to count how many members report to each member\n    report_count = [0] * (N + 1)\n    \n    # Count the number of reports for each member\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        if reporting[i - 1] != 0:  # Skip the Don\n            report_count[reporting[i - 1]] += 1\n    \n    # List to hold potential killers (members nobody reports to)\n    potential_killers = []\n    \n    # Identify members who are not reported to by anyone\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        if report_count[i] == 0:\n            potential_killers.append(i)\n    \n    # Sort the list of potential killers\n    potential_killers.sort()\n    return potential_killers\n\n# Read input values\nN = int(input())\nreporting = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Get the result from the function\nresult = find_potential_killers(N, reporting)\n\n# Print the result as space-separated integers\nprint(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n```",
