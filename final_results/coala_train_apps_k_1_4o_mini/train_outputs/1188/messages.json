He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.\nChef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.\nThere are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.\nNow, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains one integer N.\nNext line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri \u2014 the person whom the ith member reports to.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a list of space-separated integers in ascending order \u2014 the indices of potential killers.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 105\n- 1 \u2264 Ri \u2264 N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.\n- It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask #1 [50 points]: N \u2264 10000\n- Subtask #2 [50 points]: No additional constraints\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n6\n0 1 1 2 2 3\n\nOutput:\n4 5 6\n\n-----Explanation-----\nThe reporting structure:\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Each member of the mafia reports to another member, and there is a single Don who reports to no one (indicated by a reporting value of 0). The task is to identify the members of the mafia who are not reported to by anyone else, as these members are considered potential killers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To find the potential killers, we need to determine which members of the mafia do not appear as a reporting target for any other member. We can achieve this by:\n   - Creating a list to track how many members report to each member.\n   - Iterating through the reporting list to populate this tracking list.\n   - Finally, we will collect the indices of members who have a count of zero in the tracking list, as these members are not reported to by anyone.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Initialize a list 'report_count' of size N+1 with all zeros\n   For each member i from 1 to N:\n       If Ri is not 0:\n           Increment report_count[Ri] by 1\n   Initialize an empty list 'potential_killers'\n   For each member i from 1 to N:\n       If report_count[i] is 0:\n           Append i to potential_killers\n   Sort potential_killers\n   Print the elements of potential_killers as space-separated integers\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef find_potential_killers():\n    # Read the number of members\n    N = int(input())\n    # Read the reporting structure\n    R = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    # Initialize a list to count how many people report to each member\n    report_count = [0] * (N + 1)\n    \n    # Count the number of reports for each member\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        Ri = R[i - 1]  # R is 0-indexed, members are 1-indexed\n        if Ri != 0:\n            report_count[Ri] += 1\n    \n    # Find all members who are not reported to by anyone\n    potential_killers = []\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        if report_count[i] == 0:\n            potential_killers.append(i)\n    \n    # Sort the potential killers\n    potential_killers.sort()\n    \n    # Print the result as space-separated integers\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, potential_killers)))\n\n```"

The key concept involved calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals (x, y, z) to find out when all students would be on campus simultaneously.\n\n    The solution involved defining helper functions to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM, followed by a main function to read input values and compute the total number of occurrences based on the LCM. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and modular arithmetic to achieve the desired results.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against the provided test case. No unexpected errors occurred during the process, and the solution was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints. The use of integer division ensured that the results were accurate without any floating-point issues. \n\n    Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of understanding number theory concepts like GCD and LCM in solving problems related to periodic events. The code snippet for future reference is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b != 0:\n            temp = b\n            b = a % b\n            a = temp\n        return a\n\n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)\n\n    def lcm_of_three(x, y, z):\n        return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)\n\n    def count_audience(N, x, y, z):\n        total_hours = N * 24\n        lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n        return total_hours // lcm_value\n\n    T = int(input())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        x, y, z = map(int, input().split())\n        result = count_audience(N, x, y, z)\n        print(result)\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"

If a member does not have any subordinates, their list remains empty.\n3. **Identifying Potential Killers:** After building the tree, it iterates through the dictionary to find members with an empty list (indicating no one reports to them) and collects their indices.\n4. **Output:** Finally, it prints the indices of potential killers as a space-separated string.\n\nThis solution is efficient in both time and space, as it only requires a single pass to build the reporting structure and another pass to identify potential killers.
