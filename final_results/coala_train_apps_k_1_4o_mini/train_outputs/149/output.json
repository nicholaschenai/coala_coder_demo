    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to take a string and repeatedly remove groups of `k` adjacent identical characters until no such groups remain. The goal is to return the final version of the string after all possible removals.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We can use a stack-like approach to keep track of characters and their counts. As we iterate through the string, we will push characters onto the stack. If we encounter the same character again, we will increment its count. If the count reaches `k`, we will pop that character off the stack, effectively removing it from our result. This process continues until we have processed the entire string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Initialize an empty stack\n   For each character in the string:\n       If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the same character:\n           Increment the count of that character\n           If the count equals k:\n               Pop the character from the stack\n       Else:\n           Push the character onto the stack with a count of 1\n   Construct the final string from the characters in the stack\n   Return the final string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n        # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and their counts\n        stack = []\n        \n        # Iterate through each character in the string\n        for char in s:\n            # If the stack is not empty and the top character is the same as the current character\n            if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:\n                # Increment the count of that character\n                stack[-1][1] += 1\n                # If the count reaches k, pop the character from the stack\n                if stack[-1][1] == k:\n                    stack.pop()\n            else:\n                # Otherwise, push the character onto the stack with a count of 1\n                stack.append([char, 1])\n        \n        # Construct the final string from the characters in the stack\n        result = ''.join(char * count for char, count in stack)\n        return result\n```",
