    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   Chef has a number of days where he has planned tasks to complete, but he has only managed to finish a certain number of those tasks. He has access to two types of buttons: white buttons that can reduce the number of planned tasks and black buttons that can increase the number of completed tasks. The goal is to determine the minimum number of uncompleted tasks after Chef has optimally used the buttons over all the days.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   For each day, we need to decide how to use the buttons to minimize the uncompleted tasks. We can use the black buttons to increase the number of completed tasks, but we must ensure that the total completed tasks do not exceed the planned tasks. We can also use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks, but only if the planned tasks are greater than or equal to the value of the button pressed. The strategy will involve:\n   - Sorting the white buttons in descending order to maximize the reduction of planned tasks.\n   - Sorting the black buttons in descending order to maximize the increase in completed tasks.\n   - Iterating through each day and applying the buttons optimally to minimize the uncompleted tasks.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read N, K, M\n           read planned_tasks A\n           read completed_tasks B\n           read white_buttons C\n           read black_buttons D\n           \n           sort C in descending order\n           sort D in descending order\n           \n           for i from 0 to N-1:\n               # Use black buttons first to increase completed tasks\n               for each button in D:\n                   if B[i] + button <= A[i]:\n                       B[i] += button\n                       mark button as used\n                       break\n               \n               # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks\n               for each button in C:\n                   if A[i] >= button:\n                       A[i] -= button\n                       mark button as used\n                       break\n           \n           total_uncompleted = sum(A[i] - B[i] for i in range(N))\n           output total_uncompleted\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):\n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Read the number of days, white buttons, and black buttons\n        N, K, M = case[0]\n        # Read planned tasks and completed tasks\n        A = case[1]\n        B = case[2]\n        # Read white buttons and black buttons\n        C = case[3]\n        D = case[4]\n        \n        # Sort white buttons and black buttons in descending order\n        C.sort(reverse=True)\n        D.sort(reverse=True)\n        \n        # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks\n        for i in range(N):\n            for button in D:\n                if B[i] + button <= A[i]:\n                    B[i] += button\n                    D.remove(button)  # Mark button as used\n                    break\n        \n        # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks\n        for i in range(N):\n            for button in C:\n                if A[i] >= button:\n                    A[i] -= button\n                    C.remove(button)  # Mark button as used\n                    break\n        \n        # Calculate total uncompleted tasks\n        total_uncompleted = sum(A[i] - B[i] for i in range(N))\n        print(total_uncompleted)\n\n# The function can be called with appropriate parameters to execute the solution.\n```",
