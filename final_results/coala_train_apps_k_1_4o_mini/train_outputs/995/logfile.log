## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mr. Krabs loves money. He enters a bank and sees that there are n rooms arranged in a row. The only rooms with doors are the two rooms on either corner. Initially, all the rooms are locked (including the corner ones). To enter a room, it must be unlocked with a key.
Mr. Krabs is able to steal k keys from the sleeping night guard. Each key can be used to unlock only one room. To reach one of the inner rooms, he has to unlock an adjacent room first.
Eg: If there are 5 rooms labelled: 1 2 3 4 5
Only Rooms 1 and 5 can be accessed initially. To unlock room 2, either room 1 or room 3 must be unlocked. Similarly to unlock Room 4, he must unlock room 5 or room 3 first.
Each room has some money in it. The money present in room i is given by A[i]. Using the k keys, calculate what is the maximum possible amount of money obtainable.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain n,  number of rooms.
- Second line will contain space separated integers, denoting A[i], money present in each room.
- Third line will contain an integer, k, the number of keys available.

-----Output:-----
Maximum money obtained.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 10^5
- 1 <= A[i] <= 10^4
- 1 <= k <= Number of Rooms

-----Subtasks-----
- 40 points : 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 100
- 60 points : Number of Rooms > 100

-----Sample Input:-----
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 1
3

-----Sample Output:-----
12

-----Explanation:-----
For the first step, Mr. Krabs can only unlock the room at the left corner or the right corner. If he unlocks the room in the right corner, he obtains 1 dollar. He can then go on to unlock the second last room and gain 6 dollars, for a total of 7 dollars. Finally he can unlock the third last room and get 5 dollars, for a total of 12 dollars. 
This is the maximum amount of money he can get with only 3 keys.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 995 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Mr. Krabs is in a bank with a row of rooms, each containing some money. He can only unlock the first or last room initially, and he has a limited number of keys to unlock additional rooms. The goal is to determine the maximum amount of money he can collect by strategically using the keys to unlock the rooms.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will consider the maximum money that can be collected by unlocking rooms from either end of the row. We will keep track of the total money collected as we unlock rooms, ensuring that we do not exceed the number of keys available. We will explore both directions (from the left and from the right) and calculate the maximum money obtainable by unlocking rooms in a way that maximizes the total amount collected.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_money(n, A, k):
       left_money = 0
       right_money = 0
       
       // Calculate money from the left side
       for i from 0 to min(k, n) - 1:
           left_money += A[i]
       
       // Calculate money from the right side
       for i from 0 to min(k, n) - 1:
           right_money += A[n - 1 - i]
       
       // Find the maximum money obtainable
       max_money = max(left_money, right_money)
       
       // Check combinations of keys used from both sides
       for i from 1 to k - 1:
           if i < n and (k - i) < n:
               current_money = sum of A[0 to i-1] + sum of A[n - 1 to n - (k - i)]
               max_money = max(max_money, current_money)
       
       return max_money
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def max_money(n, A, k):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of money collected from both ends
    left_money = 0
    right_money = 0
    
    # Calculate total money that can be collected from the left side
    for i in range(min(k, n)):
        left_money += A[i]
    
    # Calculate total money that can be collected from the right side
    for i in range(min(k, n)):
        right_money += A[n - 1 - i]
    
    # Start with the maximum money obtainable from either side
    max_money = max(left_money, right_money)
    
    # Check combinations of keys used from both sides
    for i in range(1, k):
        if i < n and (k - i) < n:

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy given a list of prices and a budget. The core concept involved sorting the prices and iterating through them to maximize the count of chocolates purchased without exceeding the budget.

    Initially, I implemented the logic to calculate the maximum number of chocolates but neglected to include input/output handling, which resulted in no output being produced when the code was executed in the testing environment. This highlighted the importance of integrating input and output operations in competitive programming scenarios.

    The final solution involved reading the number of chocolates and the budget from standard input, processing the list of prices, and then calling the function to compute the result. The corrected code successfully passed all tests, demonstrating the effectiveness of sorting and a greedy approach to maximize purchases.

    Here is the final working code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def maxChocolates(prices, k):
        prices.sort()
        count = 0
        total_spent = 0
    
        for price in prices:
            if total_spent + price <= k:
                total_spent += price
                count += 1
            else:
                break
    
        return count

    n, k = map(int, input().strip().split())
    prices = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    result = maxChocolates(prices, k)
    print(result)
    ```

    Key takeaways include the necessity of handling input/output correctly and the effectiveness of sorting combined with a greedy algorithm to solve optimization problems.

INFO - [Task id] 995 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Mr. Krabs is in a bank with a series of rooms lined up in a row. He can only unlock the first or last room initially. He has a limited number of keys, and each key can unlock one room. To access inner rooms, he must first unlock an adjacent room. Each room contains a certain amount of money, and the goal is to determine the maximum amount of money Mr. Krabs can collect using the keys he has.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will consider the maximum money that can be collected by unlocking rooms from either end of the row. We will simulate unlocking rooms from both the left and right sides, keeping track of the total money collected. We will iterate through the rooms, unlocking them one by one until we run out of keys, and calculate the total money collected for each possible starting point (left or right). Finally, we will return the maximum amount of money collected.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mr. Krabs loves money. He enters a bank and sees that there are n rooms arranged in a row. The only rooms with doors are the two rooms on either corner. Initially, all the rooms are locked (including the corner ones). To enter a room, it must be unlocked with a key.
Mr. Krabs is able to steal k keys from the sleeping night guard. Each key can be used to unlock only one room. To reach one of the inner rooms, he has to unlock an adjacent room first.
Eg: If there are 5 rooms labelled: 1 2 3 4 5
Only Rooms 1 and 5 can be accessed initially. To unlock room 2, either room 1 or room 3 must be unlocked. Similarly to unlock Room 4, he must unlock room 5 or room 3 first.
Each room has some money in it. The money present in room i is given by A[i]. Using the k keys, calculate what is the maximum possible amount of money obtainable.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain n,  number of rooms.
- Second line will contain space separated integers, denoting A[i], money present in each room.
- Third line will contain an integer, k, the number of keys available.

-----Output:-----
Maximum money obtained.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 10^5
- 1 <= A[i] <= 10^4
- 1 <= k <= Number of Rooms

-----Subtasks-----
- 40 points : 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 100
- 60 points : Number of Rooms > 100

-----Sample Input:-----
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 1
3

-----Sample Output:-----
12

-----Explanation:-----
For the first step, Mr. Krabs can only unlock the room at the left corner or the right corner. If he unlocks the room in the right corner, he obtains 1 dollar. He can then go on to unlock the second last room and gain 6 dollars, for a total of 7 dollars. Finally he can unlock the third last room and get 5 dollars, for a total of 12 dollars. 
This is the maximum amount of money he can get with only 3 keys.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 995 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Mr. Krabs is in a bank with a series of rooms lined up in a row. He can only unlock the first or last room initially. He has a limited number of keys, and each key can unlock one room. To access inner rooms, he must first unlock an adjacent room. Each room contains a certain amount of money, and the goal is to determine the maximum amount of money Mr. Krabs can collect using the keys he has.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will consider the maximum money that can be collected by unlocking rooms from either end of the row. We will simulate unlocking rooms from both the left and right sides, keeping track of the total money collected. We will iterate through the rooms, unlocking them one by one until we run out of keys, and calculate the total money collected for each possible starting point (left or right). Finally, we will return the maximum amount of money collected.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function maxMoney(A, k):
       n = length of A
       max_money = 0
       
       for i from 0 to k:
           if i < n:
               left_money = sum of first i rooms from left
           if k - i < n:
               right_money = sum of first (k - i) rooms from right
           total_money = left_money + right_money
           max_money = max(max_money, total_money)
       
       return max_money

   read n
   read A
   read k
   result = maxMoney(A, k)
   print(result)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def maxMoney(A, k):
    n = len(A)
    max_money = 0

INFO - [Task id] 995 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine the maximum amount of money Mr. Krabs could collect from a series of rooms using a limited number of keys. The key concepts involved understanding how to unlock rooms from either end of the row and calculating the total money collected based on the keys used.

The approach taken was a greedy algorithm that iterated through the possible number of keys used from the left side, while simultaneously calculating the money that could be collected from both the left and right sides. This involved summing the values in the list of room amounts based on the keys available. The solution effectively handled the constraints and provided the correct output for the sample input.

The final implementation was straightforward, utilizing basic list operations and loops without any external libraries. The code was structured to first define the main function and then read input values, which was a clean and effective way to organize the solution. The implementation passed the provided test case successfully, indicating that the logic was sound and efficient for the problem's constraints. 

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and using a systematic approach to calculate the desired outcome.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mr. Krabs loves money. He enters a bank and sees that there are n rooms arranged in a row. The only rooms with doors are the two rooms on either corner. Initially, all the rooms are locked (including the corner ones). To enter a room, it must be unlocked with a key.
Mr. Krabs is able to steal k keys from the sleeping night guard. Each key can be used to unlock only one room. To reach one of the inner rooms, he has to unlock an adjacent room first.
Eg: If there are 5 rooms labelled: 1 2 3 4 5
Only Rooms 1 and 5 can be accessed initially. To unlock room 2, either room 1 or room 3 must be unlocked. Similarly to unlock Room 4, he must unlock room 5 or room 3 first.
Each room has some money in it. The money present in room i is given by A[i]. Using the k keys, calculate what is the maximum possible amount of money obtainable.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain n,  number of rooms.
- Second line will contain space separated integers, denoting A[i], money present in each room.
- Third line will contain an integer, k, the number of keys available.

-----Output:-----
Maximum money obtained.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 10^5
- 1 <= A[i] <= 10^4
- 1 <= k <= Number of Rooms

-----Subtasks-----
- 40 points : 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 100
- 60 points : Number of Rooms > 100

-----Sample Input:-----
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 1
3

-----Sample Output:-----
12

-----Explanation:-----
For the first step, Mr. Krabs can only unlock the room at the left corner or the right corner. If he unlocks the room in the right corner, he obtains 1 dollar. He can then go on to unlock the second last room and gain 6 dollars, for a total of 7 dollars. Finally he can unlock the third last room and get 5 dollars, for a total of 12 dollars. 
This is the maximum amount of money he can get with only 3 keys.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
rooms=int(input())
money=list(map(int,input().split()))
keys=int(input())
rev=-1
a,b=0,-1
tot=[]
#print(money[-3:-1])
x=0
for i in range(keys):
    #print(money[b:-1],money[0:a])
    x=sum(money[b:])+sum(money[0:keys-abs(b)])
    tot.append(x)
    b-=1
print(max(tot))


INFO - [Task id] 995 [generation text] The official solution takes a more efficient approach to calculate the maximum money Mr. Krabs can collect using the keys. It utilizes a single loop to iterate through the number of keys, calculating the total money collected from both ends of the room array in a more compact manner.

Key insights from the official solution:

1. **Two-pointer Technique**: The solution uses two pointers (`a` and `b`) to represent the current positions from the left and right ends of the room array. This allows for a dynamic calculation of the total money collected as keys are used.

2. **Single Loop Calculation**: Instead of calculating the sum of money for each possible combination of left and right rooms separately, the official solution maintains a running total in a single loop. This reduces the complexity of the solution significantly.

3. **Dynamic Range Calculation**: The use of slicing (`money[b:]` and `money[0:keys-abs(b)]`) allows for a straightforward way to sum the money from the unlocked rooms without needing nested loops or additional data structures.

4. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient in both time and space complexity, as it avoids unnecessary recalculations and keeps the operations within a single loop.

In contrast, my initial approach involved nested loops and separate calculations for left and right sums, which could lead to higher time complexity, especially for larger inputs. The official solution's method of dynamically adjusting the range of rooms being summed is a more elegant and efficient way to solve the problem. 

Overall, this experience highlights the importance of considering different approaches to problem-solving, particularly the benefits of using efficient algorithms and data structures.
