He enters a bank and sees that there are n rooms arranged in a row. The only rooms with doors are the two rooms on either corner. Initially, all the rooms are locked (including the corner ones). To enter a room, it must be unlocked with a key.\nMr. Krabs is able to steal k keys from the sleeping night guard. Each key can be used to unlock only one room. To reach one of the inner rooms, he has to unlock an adjacent room first.\nEg: If there are 5 rooms labelled: 1 2 3 4 5\nOnly Rooms 1 and 5 can be accessed initially. To unlock room 2, either room 1 or room 3 must be unlocked. Similarly to unlock Room 4, he must unlock room 5 or room 3 first.\nEach room has some money in it. The money present in room i is given by A[i]. Using the k keys, calculate what is the maximum possible amount of money obtainable.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain n,  number of rooms.\n- Second line will contain space separated integers, denoting A[i], money present in each room.\n- Third line will contain an integer, k, the number of keys available.\n\n-----Output:-----\nMaximum money obtained.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 10^5\n- 1 <= A[i] <= 10^4\n- 1 <= k <= Number of Rooms\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- 40 points : 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 100\n- 60 points : Number of Rooms > 100\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 1\n3\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n12\n\n-----Explanation:-----\nFor the first step, Mr. Krabs can only unlock the room at the left corner or the right corner. If he unlocks the room in the right corner, he obtains 1 dollar. He can then go on to unlock the second last room and gain 6 dollars, for a total of 7 dollars. Finally he can unlock the third last room and get 5 dollars, for a total of 12 dollars. \nThis is the maximum amount of money he can get with only 3 keys.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

He can only unlock the first or last room initially, and he has a limited number of keys to unlock additional rooms. The goal is to determine the maximum amount of money he can collect by strategically using the keys to unlock the rooms.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will consider the maximum money that can be collected by unlocking rooms from either end of the row. We will keep track of the total money collected as we unlock rooms, ensuring that we do not exceed the number of keys available. We will explore both directions (from the left and from the right) and calculate the maximum money obtainable by unlocking rooms in a way that maximizes the total amount collected.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function max_money(n, A, k):\n       left_money = 0\n       right_money = 0\n       \n       // Calculate money from the left side\n       for i from 0 to min(k, n) - 1:\n           left_money += A[i]\n       \n       // Calculate money from the right side\n       for i from 0 to min(k, n) - 1:\n           right_money += A[n - 1 - i]\n       \n       // Find the maximum money obtainable\n       max_money = max(left_money, right_money)\n       \n       // Check combinations of keys used from both sides\n       for i from 1 to k - 1:\n           if i < n and (k - i) < n:\n               current_money = sum of A[0 to i-1] + sum of A[n - 1 to n - (k - i)]\n               max_money = max(max_money, current_money)\n       \n       return max_money\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef max_money(n, A, k):\n    # Initialize variables to keep track of money collected from both ends\n    left_money = 0\n    right_money = 0\n    \n    # Calculate total money that can be collected from the left side\n    for i in range(min(k, n)):\n        left_money += A[i]\n    \n    # Calculate total money that can be collected from the right side\n    for i in range(min(k, n)):\n        right_money += A[n - 1 - i]\n    \n    # Start with the maximum money obtainable from either side\n    max_money = max(left_money, right_money)\n    \n    # Check combinations of keys used from both sides\n    for i in range(1, k):\n        if i < n and (k - i) < n:\n            current_money = sum(A[0:i]) + sum(A[n - (k - i):n])\n            max_money = max(max_money, current_money)\n    \n    return max_money\n\n# Read input values\nn = int(input())\nA = list(map(int, input().split()))\nk = int(input())\n\n# Output the maximum money obtainable\nprint(max_money(n, A, k))\n```"

The core concept involved sorting the prices and iterating through them to maximize the count of chocolates purchased without exceeding the budget.\n\n    Initially, I implemented the logic to calculate the maximum number of chocolates but neglected to include input/output handling, which resulted in no output being produced when the code was executed in the testing environment. This highlighted the importance of integrating input and output operations in competitive programming scenarios.\n\n    The final solution involved reading the number of chocolates and the budget from standard input, processing the list of prices, and then calling the function to compute the result. The corrected code successfully passed all tests, demonstrating the effectiveness of sorting and a greedy approach to maximize purchases.\n\n    Here is the final working code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def maxChocolates(prices, k):\n        prices.sort()\n        count = 0\n        total_spent = 0\n    \n        for price in prices:\n            if total_spent + price <= k:\n                total_spent += price\n                count += 1\n            else:\n                break\n    \n        return count\n\n    n, k = map(int, input().strip().split())\n    prices = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))\n    result = maxChocolates(prices, k)\n    print(result)\n    ```\n\n    Key takeaways include the necessity of handling input/output correctly and the effectiveness of sorting combined with a greedy algorithm to solve optimization problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This reduces the complexity of the solution significantly.\n\n3. **Dynamic Range Calculation**: The use of slicing (`money[b:]` and `money[0:keys-abs(b)]`) allows for a straightforward way to sum the money from the unlocked rooms without needing nested loops or additional data structures.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient in both time and space complexity, as it avoids unnecessary recalculations and keeps the operations within a single loop.\n\nIn contrast, my initial approach involved nested loops and separate calculations for left and right sums, which could lead to higher time complexity, especially for larger inputs.
