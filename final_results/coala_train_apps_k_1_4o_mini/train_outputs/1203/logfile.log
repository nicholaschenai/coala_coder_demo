## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


-----Input:-----
- The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
- Next Q line contains two number I and K.

-----Output:-----
For each test case print required answer.

-----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=1000000
Subtask 3: 5 points
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=16
- 1<=Q<=1000
Subtask 1: 25 points
- T=1
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=100000
Subtask 2: 70 points
- Original Constraints.

-----Example:-----
Input:

1

3 3

1 2

2 1

3 2

Output:

0

2

2

-----Explanation:-----
For N=3

total subsets are:

{1}

{2}

{3}

{1,2}

{1,3}

{2,3}

{1,2,3}

Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the number of subsets of the first N natural numbers (1 to N) where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of that subset. We will handle multiple test cases and queries efficiently, as the constraints are quite large.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each test case, we will read the values of N and Q.
   - For each query, we need to determine how many subsets exist where the number I is at position K.
   - To do this, we can break down the problem:
     - If I is at position K, then there must be K-1 numbers less than I in the subset.
     - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than I.
   - We can use combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of ways to choose the required numbers:
     - The number of ways to choose K-1 numbers from the first I-1 numbers (those less than I).
     - The number of ways to choose any number of elements from the remaining numbers (those greater than I).
   - We will precompute factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently calculate combinations.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
        You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
        Note f([1]) = 0.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
        - The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
        Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

        -----Constraints-----
        - 1 ≤ T ≤ 40
        - 1 ≤ N ≤ 105
        - Sum of N over all test cases in each file ≤ 106

        Output:
        -1
        1 2
        5 4 3 2 1

        -----Explanation-----
        Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
        Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
        Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
           We need to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function, f(P), equals a given integer K. The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. If no such permutation exists for the given N and K, we should return -1.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
           To solve this problem, we need to understand the maximum possible value of f(P) for a given N. The maximum value occurs when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the highest possible sums of adjacent maximums. The minimum value of f(P) is 0, which occurs when N is 1. We can derive the maximum value of f(P) as follows:
           - For a permutation of size N, the maximum value of f(P) is calculated as:
             - f(P) = (N) + (N-1) + ... + (2) = N * (N - 1) / 2
           - If K is greater than this maximum value or less than 0, we return -1.
           - If K is achievable, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to meet the exact value of K.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
           ```
           function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
               for each test_case in test_cases:
                   N, K = test_case
                   max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2
                   if K > max_f or K < 0:
                       print -1
                   else:
                       create a descending list from N to 1
                       adjust the list to achieve the exact value of K
                       print the permutation

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the number of subsets from the set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} such that a specific number I appears at the K-th position in the sorted order of the subset. The output should be the count of such subsets for multiple queries, and since the result can be large, we need to return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to consider how subsets are formed and how to determine the position of a specific number within those subsets. The key steps are:
   - For a number I to be at position K in a subset, there must be exactly K-1 numbers less than I in the subset.
   - The remaining numbers can be any of the numbers greater than I.
   - We can use combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of ways to choose K-1 numbers from the numbers less than I and any number of numbers from those greater than I.
   - We will precompute factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently calculate combinations.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function calculate_subsets(N, queries):
       MOD = 10**9 + 7

           if K > I or K < 1:

           else:
               count_less_than_I = I - 1

               ways_to_choose = comb(count_less_than_I, K - 1)

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the number of subsets from the set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} such that a specific number I appears at the K-th position in the sorted order of the subset. The output should be the count of such subsets for multiple queries, and since the result can be large, we need to return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to consider how subsets are formed and how to determine the position of a specific number within those subsets. The key steps are:
   - For a number I to be at position K in a subset, there must be exactly K-1 numbers less than I in the subset.
   - The remaining numbers can be any of the numbers greater than I.
   - We can use combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of ways to choose K-1 numbers from the numbers less than I and any number of numbers from those greater than I.
   - We will precompute factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently calculate combinations.

-----Explanation:-----
For N=3

total subsets are:

{1}

{2}

{3}

{1,2}

{1,3}

{2,3}

{1,2,3}

Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions
Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to calculate the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at the K-th position in the sorted order of the subset. The solution required a combinatorial approach, leveraging factorials and modular arithmetic to efficiently compute combinations.

Key concepts included:
- Understanding that for I to be at position K, there must be exactly K-1 numbers less than I in the subset.
- Using precomputed factorials and their modular inverses to calculate combinations efficiently, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and Q can be up to 1,000,000.

The implemented solution involved:
1. Precomputing factorials and their inverses up to N.
2. For each query, checking if K is valid (i.e., K ≤ I and K ≥ 1).
3. Calculating the number of ways to choose K-1 numbers from those less than I and multiplying by the number of subsets formed by numbers greater than I.

The final code was structured to read input, process multiple test cases, and output results efficiently. The solution passed the provided test cases, confirming its correctness. 

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of combinatorial mathematics in subset problems and the utility of modular arithmetic in handling large numbers.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] The official solution provides a more straightforward approach to solving the problem of counting subsets with specific conditions. Here are the key insights and steps distilled from the official solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The solution correctly identifies that if \( K > I \), the count of valid subsets is zero because there cannot be \( K \) elements in a subset if \( I \) is the \( K \)-th element.

2. **Counting Subsets**:
   - The number of elements greater than \( I \) is \( n - i \). The total number of subsets that can be formed with these elements is \( 2^{(n-i)} \).
   - The number of ways to choose \( K-1 \) elements from the \( I-1 \) elements less than \( I \) is calculated using a combinatorial approach. The solution uses a loop to compute the binomial coefficient \( C(i-1, k-1) \) without directly using factorials, which can be computationally expensive.

3. **Efficiency**: The official solution avoids precomputing factorials and their inverses, which can save space and time in scenarios where \( N \) is large. Instead, it calculates the binomial coefficient on-the-fly using a loop, which is efficient for the constraints given.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**: The solution correctly applies modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to ensure that the results fit within standard integer limits and adhere to the problem's requirements.

5. **Final Output**: The results are printed immediately after computation for each query, which is efficient for handling multiple queries.

Overall, the official solution is effective in its simplicity and directness, leveraging combinatorial logic without unnecessary complexity. This experience highlights the importance of understanding combinatorial principles and efficient computation techniques in competitive programming.

[Problem]
    Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
    number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
    The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


    -----Input:-----
    - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
    - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
    - Next Q line contains two number I and K.

    -----Output:-----
    For each test case print required answer.

    -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
    - 1<=T<=5
    - 1<=N, K<=4000
    - 1<=Q<=1000000
    Subtask 3: 5 points
    - 1<=T<=5
    - 1<=N, K<=16
    - 1<=Q<=1000
    Subtask 1: 25 points
    - T=1
    - 1<=N, K<=4000
    - 1<=Q<=100000
    Subtask 2: 70 points
    - Original Constraints.

    -----Example:-----
    Input:

    1

    3 3

    1 2

    2 1

    3 2

    Output:

    0

    2

    2

    -----Explanation:-----
    For N=3

    total subsets are:

    {1}

    {2}

    {3}

    {1,2}

    {1,3}

    {2,3}

    {1,2,3}

    Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

    For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

    Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.
