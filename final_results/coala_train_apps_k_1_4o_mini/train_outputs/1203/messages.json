If no such permutation exists for the given N and K, we should return -1.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n           To solve this problem, we need to understand the maximum possible value of f(P) for a given N.

We can derive the maximum value of f(P) as follows:\n           - For a permutation of size N, the maximum value of f(P) is calculated as:\n             - f(P) = (N) + (N-1) + ... + (2) = N * (N - 1) / 2\n           - If K is greater than this maximum value or less than 0, we return -1.\n           - If K is achievable, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to meet the exact value of K.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n           ```\n           function find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n               for each test_case in test_cases:\n                   N, K = test_case\n                   max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2\n                   if K > max_f or K < 0:\n                       print -1\n                   else:\n                       create a descending list from N to 1\n                       adjust the list to achieve the exact value of K\n                       print the permutation\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n        ```python\n        def find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n            results = []  # To store results for each test case\n            for case in test_cases:\n                N, K = case\n                max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum possible f(P)\n        \n                if K > max_f or K < 0:  # Check if K is out of bounds\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n                else:\n                    # Start with the descending permutation\n                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                    current_f = max_f  # Start with the maximum f(P)\n            \n                    # Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K\n                    for i in range(N - 1):\n                        if current_f == K:\n                            break\n                        # If we can reduce the current_f by 1, we swap elements\n                        if current_f > K:\n                            # Swap the last two elements to reduce the f(P) value\n                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                            current_f -= 1  # Decrease the f(P) value by 1\n            \n                    results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))  # Store the result as a string\n\n            # Print all results at once for efficiency\n            print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\n        # Read number of test cases\n        T = int(input())\n        test_cases = []\n\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, input().split())\n            test_cases.append((N, K))\n\n        find_permutation(T, test_cases)\n        ```\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n        None\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: ['3', '4 12', '2 2', '5 14'] Expected output: [{'-1'}, {'2', '1'}, {'2', '5', '1', '3', '4'}] # Execution output: ['-1', '-1', '-1']\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Failure\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"

        "content": "The official solution provides a more straightforward approach to solving the problem of counting subsets with specific conditions. Here are the key insights and steps distilled from the official solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The solution correctly identifies that if \\( K > I \\), the count of valid subsets is zero because there cannot be \\( K \\) elements in a subset if \\( I \\) is the \\( K \\)-th element.\n\n2. **Counting Subsets**:\n   - The number of elements greater than \\( I \\) is \\( n - i \\). The total number of subsets that can be formed with these elements is \\( 2^{(n-i)} \\).\n   - The number of ways to choose \\( K-1 \\) elements from the \\( I-1 \\) elements less than \\( I \\) is calculated using a combinatorial approach. The solution uses a loop to compute the binomial coefficient \\( C(i-1, k-1) \\) without directly using factorials, which can be computationally expensive.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The official solution avoids precomputing factorials and their inverses, which can save space and time in scenarios where \\( N \\) is large. Instead, it calculates the binomial coefficient on-the-fly using a loop, which is efficient for the constraints given.\n\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: The solution correctly applies modulo \\( 10^9 + 7 \\) to ensure that the results fit within standard integer limits and adhere to the problem's requirements.\n\n5. **Final Output**: The results are printed immediately after computation for each query, which is efficient for handling multiple queries.\n\nOverall, the official solution is effective in its simplicity and directness, leveraging combinatorial logic without unnecessary complexity. This experience highlights the importance of understanding combinatorial principles and efficient computation techniques in competitive programming."

        "content": "\n[description for function: calculate_subsets]\nThis function calculates the number of valid subsets for given queries based on a total of N elements. It first precomputes factorials and their modular inverses to facilitate efficient combination calculations. For each query, it checks if the specified conditions are met and computes the number of ways to choose elements less than a given index while considering the total number of subsets that can be formed from the remaining elements. The results for each query are collected and printed at the end. The function ensures that all calculations are performed under a specified modulus to handle large numbers. Overall, it efficiently handles multiple queries regarding subset selection.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to analyze subsets of a set of natural numbers, particularly in combinatorial problems involving constraints on the positions of elements within those subsets. It can be applied in competitive programming, algorithm design, and mathematical problem-solving where efficient computation of combinations and modular arithmetic is required, especially when dealing with large inputs and multiple queries. Understanding how to precompute factorials and their inverses can significantly optimize the performance of such algorithms."
