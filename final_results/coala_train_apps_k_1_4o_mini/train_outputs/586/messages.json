The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.\n$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. \nThat means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').\nIt is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.\n\n-----Input:-----Input:\n- \nFirst line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- \nThe first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. \n- \nThen $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.\n- \nThen $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.\n\n-----Output:-----Output:\nFor each testcase,print the scoreboard.\nThat means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order\n\n-----Constraints-----Constraints\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10$\n- $1 \\leq R \\leq N \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq ti \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq pi \\leq 10^6$\nSum of points ($pi$) of a team will not cross $10^9$.\n\n-----Sample Input:-----Sample Input:\n1\n10 5\namigoes  1\nbannermen 1\nmonarchy 4\noutliers 5\niniciador 10\naegimos 2\niiiacdnor 1\neilorstu 1\ngimosae 3\nmnachroy 7\n\n-----Sample Output:-----Sample Output:\niniciador 11\nmonarchy 11\namigoes 6\noutliers 6\nbannermen 1\n\n-----Explanation:-----Explanation:\n\n$It$ $is$ $assured$ $that$ $each$ $team$ $will$ $submit$ $once$ $within$ $first$ $half$ $an$ $hour$.That means -                                          \n\nthat kind of submissions isn't possible within first half an hour.\nDataset can be huge.

Each team has a unique name, but the order of characters in the name does not matter (e.g., \"abc\" is the same as \"cba\"). After collecting scores from the teams, he wants to create a scoreboard that lists the teams and their total scores. The scoreboard should be sorted first by score in descending order, and if two teams have the same score, they should be sorted by their names in alphabetical order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - Read the number of test cases.\n   - For each test case, read the number of total submissions and the number of submissions in the first half hour.\n   - Create a dictionary to store the total scores for each team, using a normalized version of the team name (sorted characters of the name) as the key.\n   - For the first half hour submissions, directly add the scores to the corresponding team in the dictionary.\n   - For the remaining submissions, normalize the team names and add the scores to the corresponding team in the dictionary.\n   - Once all scores are collected, sort the teams first by score (in descending order) and then by name (in alphabetical order).\n   - Print the sorted results.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function main():\n       read T\n       for each test case from 1 to T:\n           read N, R\n           create an empty dictionary scores\n           for i from 1 to R:\n               read team_name, points\n               add points to scores[team_name]\n           for i from 1 to (N - R):\n               read scrambled_team_name, points\n               normalized_name = sort(scrambled_team_name)\n               add points to scores[normalized_name]\n           sorted_teams = sort(scores.items(), by score descending, then by name ascending)\n           for team, score in sorted_teams:\n               print team, score\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R\n        index += 1\n        scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores\n        \n        # Read the first R submissions\n        for _ in range(R):\n            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on the last space\n            team_name = line[0]\n            points = int(line[1])\n            scores[team_name] = scores.get(team_name, 0) + points\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Read the remaining N-R submissions\n        for _ in range(N - R):\n            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on the last space\n            scrambled_team_name = line[0]\n            points = int(line[1])\n            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(scrambled_team_name))  # Normalize the team name\n            scores[normalized_name] = scores.get(normalized_name, 0) + points\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Sort teams by score (descending) and then by name (ascending)\n        sorted_teams = sorted(scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n        \n        # Prepare results for this test case\n        for team, score in sorted_teams:\n            results.append(f\"{team} {score}\")\n    \n    # Print all results\n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\n# Call the main function to execute the solution\nmain()\n```"

Instead of printing the results directly, it should be collecting them in a specific format (as dictionaries) and then returning or printing that collection.\n   - The normalization of team names is done correctly, but the way results are stored and printed does not match the expected output structure.\n\n4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:\n   - Change the way results are collected to match the expected output format (list of dictionaries).\n   - Ensure that the output is printed in the correct format after processing all test cases.\n\nNow, let's implement the necessary changes to the code to ensure it meets the requirements:\n\n```python\ndef process_competition_scores():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R\n        index += 1\n        scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores\n        \n        # Process first half hour submissions\n        for _ in range(R):\n            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space\n            team_name = line[0]\n            points = int(line[1])\n            if team_name not in scores:\n                scores[team_name] = 0\n            scores[team_name] += points\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Process remaining submissions\n        for _ in range(N - R):\n            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space\n            scrambled_team_name = line[0]\n            points = int(line[1])\n            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(scrambled_team_name))  # Normalize team name\n            if normalized_name not in scores:\n                scores[normalized_name] = 0\n            scores[normalized_name] += points\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Sort the results first by score (descending) then by name (ascending)\n        sorted_scores = sorted(scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n        \n        # Prepare results for this test case\n        for team_name, total_score in sorted_scores:\n            results.append({team_name: total_score})  # Store as dictionary\n    \n    # Print all results\n    print(results)\n\n``` \n\nIn this revised code:\n- The results are now stored as dictionaries in a list, which matches the expected output format.\n- The output is printed as a list of dictionaries after processing all test cases."

The output needed to be a scoreboard sorted by scores in descending order and by team names in lexicographical order when scores were tied.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n- **Normalization of Team Names**: The core concept was to normalize team names by sorting their characters to handle the scrambled submissions correctly.\n- **Score Aggregation**: Scores needed to be aggregated based on the normalized team names while retaining the original names for output.\n\n### Strategies and Issues:\n- Initially, I stored results as formatted strings instead of dictionaries, which did not match the expected output format. The output needed to be a list of dictionaries, each containing a team name and its score.\n- I also faced issues with correctly identifying the original team names from the normalized names, leading to incorrect score aggregation.\n\n### Fixes:\n- I corrected the output format by ensuring results were stored as dictionaries.\n- I implemented a loop to match normalized names with their original counterparts for accurate score aggregation.\n- The final output was printed as a list of dictionaries, which aligned with the expected output format.\n\n### Final Code Snippet:\n```python\ndef process_competition_scores():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R\n        index += 1\n        scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores\n        \n        # Process first half hour submissions\n        for _ in range(R):\n            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space\n            team_name = line[0]\n            points = int(line[1])\n            if team_name not in scores:\n                scores[team_name] = 0\n            scores[team_name] += points\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Process remaining submissions\n        for _ in range(N - R):\n            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space\n            scrambled_team_name = line[0]\n            points = int(line[1])\n            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(scrambled_team_name))  # Normalize team name\n            \n            # Find the original team name that corresponds to the normalized name\n            for original_name in list(scores.keys()):\n                if ''.join(sorted(original_name)) == normalized_name:\n                    scores[original_name] += points\n                    break\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Sort the results first by score (descending) then by name (ascending)\n        sorted_scores = sorted(scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n        \n        # Prepare results for this test case\n        for team_name, total_score in sorted_scores:\n            results.append({team_name: total_score})  # Store as dictionary\n    \n    # Print all results\n    print(results)\n\n# Call the function to execute the logic\nprocess_competition_scores()\n```\n\nThis summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, highlighting the key concepts, strategies, and the final solution."

        "content": "In this problem, the goal was to aggregate scores for programming competition teams, where team names could be presented in any order of characters. The main challenge was to ensure that the scores were correctly attributed to the original team names despite the scrambled submissions.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n1. **Input Handling**: The official solution efficiently reads input using `input()` and processes it in a loop for multiple test cases. This is a straightforward approach that ensures clarity and simplicity.\n\n2. **Data Structures**: \n   - The solution uses a list `a` to store scores and team names, and another list `sr` to store sorted versions of the team names. This allows for easy comparison between the original and scrambled names.\n   - The use of a tuple-like structure (`[10**10 - y, x]`) allows for easy score management, where the score is adjusted by subtracting the points from a large constant.\n\n3. **Normalization**: The official solution sorts the team names to create a normalized version, which is then used for comparison. This is a crucial step that ensures that different permutations of the same team name are treated as equivalent.\n\n4. **Score Adjustment**: The solution iterates through the remaining submissions and adjusts the scores based on the normalized names. This is done efficiently by checking against the pre-sorted list of team names.\n\n5. **Sorting and Output**: Finally, the results are sorted based on scores and printed in the required format. The use of `abs(i[0] - 10**10)` to retrieve the actual score is a clever way to maintain the original score structure while ensuring clarity in output.\n\n### Reflection on My Attempts:\n- My initial approach failed primarily due to incorrect handling of team name normalization and output formatting. I mistakenly used sorted character strings as keys for score aggregation, which led to mismatches in team names.\n- The official solution's method of maintaining a separate list for sorted names and using it for comparison was more effective and straightforward.\n- I learned the importance of clearly defining data structures and ensuring that the output format matches the expected results. The official solution's approach to score management and normalization provided a clearer path to solving the problem efficiently. \n\nOverall, this experience highlighted the significance of careful input handling, data structure choice, and output formatting in competitive programming."
