## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

-----Input:-----Input:
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
- 
Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
- 
Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

-----Output:-----Output:
For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order

-----Constraints-----Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq R \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq ti \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq pi \leq 10^6$
Sum of points ($pi$) of a team will not cross $10^9$.

-----Explanation:-----Explanation:

$It$ $is$ $assured$ $that$ $each$ $team$ $will$ $submit$ $once$ $within$ $first$ $half$ $an$ $hour$.That means -                                          

that kind of submissions isn't possible within first half an hour.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Teacher Sungjae is organizing a programming competition and has a list of team submissions. Each team has a unique name, but the order of characters in the name does not matter (e.g., "abc" is the same as "cba"). After collecting scores from the teams, he wants to create a scoreboard that lists the teams and their total scores. The scoreboard should be sorted first by score in descending order, and if two teams have the same score, they should be sorted by their names in alphabetical order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of total submissions and the number of submissions in the first half hour.
   - Create a dictionary to store the total scores for each team, using a normalized version of the team name (sorted characters of the name) as the key.
   - For the first half hour submissions, directly add the scores to the corresponding team in the dictionary.
   - For the remaining submissions, normalize the team names and add the scores to the corresponding team in the dictionary.
   - Once all scores are collected, sort the teams first by score (in descending order) and then by name (in alphabetical order).
   - Print the sorted results.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by utilizing a dictionary to group problems by their difficulty scores. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:

    1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of problems (p) and subtasks (s) in a single line, which is efficient for handling input.

    2. **Using a Dictionary for Grouping**: Instead of maintaining a list of tuples for difficulties, the official solution uses a dictionary (`scores`) where the keys are the difficulty counts and the values are lists of problem indices. This allows for easy grouping and retrieval of problems with the same difficulty.

    3. **Score Calculation**: The solution pairs scores with the number of contestants who solved them using a dictionary (`nsc`). It then sorts the scores and counts how many times the number of contestants solving a subtask is greater than the next subtask. This is done using a simple loop over the sorted scores.

    4. **Sorting and Output**: After calculating the scores, the solution sorts the keys of the dictionary (the difficulty counts) and then sorts the problem indices for each difficulty before printing them. This ensures that the output is in the correct order.

    5. **Efficiency**: The use of dictionaries and sorting operations is efficient given the constraints, and the overall complexity remains manageable even for the upper limits of the input sizes.

    Overall, the official solution is insightful in its use of data structures to simplify the problem of grouping and sorting, which could be a useful approach in similar problems involving categorization and ordering based on computed values.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

-----Input:-----Input:
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
- 
Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
- 
Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

-----Output:-----Output:
For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order

-----Constraints-----Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq R \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq ti \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq pi \leq 10^6$
Sum of points ($pi$) of a team will not cross $10^9$.

-----Sample Input:-----Sample Input:
1
10 5
amigoes  1
bannermen 1
monarchy 4
outliers 5
iniciador 10
aegimos 2
iiiacdnor 1
eilorstu 1
gimosae 3
mnachroy 7

-----Sample Output:-----Sample Output:
iniciador 11

bannermen 1

-----Explanation:-----Explanation:

$It$ $is$ $assured$ $that$ $each$ $team$ $will$ $submit$ $once$ $within$ $first$ $half$ $an$ $hour$.That means -                                          

that kind of submissions isn't possible within first half an hour.
Dataset can be huge. Use faster I/O method.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Teacher Sungjae is organizing a programming competition and has a list of team submissions. Each team has a unique name, but the order of characters in the name does not matter (e.g., "abc" is the same as "cba"). After collecting scores from the teams, he wants to create a scoreboard that lists the teams and their total scores. The scoreboard should be sorted first by score in descending order, and if two teams have the same score, they should be sorted by their names in alphabetical order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of total submissions and the number of submissions in the first half hour.
   - Create a dictionary to store the total scores for each team, using a normalized version of the team name (sorted characters) as the key.
   - For the first half hour submissions, directly add the scores to the corresponding team in the dictionary.
   - For the remaining submissions, normalize the team names and add the scores to the corresponding entries in the dictionary.
   - Once all scores are collected, sort the teams first by score (in descending order) and then by name (in alphabetical order).
   - Print the sorted results.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function process_competition_scores():
       read T  // number of test cases
       for each test case:
           read N, R  // total submissions, submissions in first half hour
           scores = {}  // dictionary to hold team scores
           
           for i from 1 to R:
               read team_name, points
               if team_name not in scores:
                   scores[team_name] = 0
               scores[team_name] += points

               read scrambled_team_name, points
               normalized_name = sort(scrambled_team_name)
               if normalized_name not in scores:
                   scores[normalized_name] = 0
               scores[normalized_name] += points

           print sorted_scores

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [generation text] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a specified number of team submissions and their scores.
   - The output should be a list of teams with their total scores, sorted first by score in descending order and then by team name in lexicographical order.

2. **Identifying the Problem**:
   - The code is designed to read input from standard input and process it, but it seems that the output format is not matching the expected output.
   - The expected output format is a list of dictionaries, but the code is currently printing strings instead.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The code is not correctly formatting the output. Instead of printing the results directly, it should be collecting them in a specific format (as dictionaries) and then returning or printing that collection.
   - The normalization of team names is done correctly, but the way results are stored and printed does not match the expected output structure.

4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:
   - Change the way results are collected to match the expected output format (list of dictionaries).
   - Ensure that the output is printed in the correct format after processing all test cases.

Now, let's implement the necessary changes to the code to ensure it meets the requirements:

```python
def process_competition_scores():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R
        index += 1
        scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores
        
        # Process first half hour submissions
        for _ in range(R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space
            team_name = line[0]
            points = int(line[1])
            if team_name not in scores:
                scores[team_name] = 0
            scores[team_name] += points
            index += 1
        
        # Process remaining submissions
        for _ in range(N - R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space
            scrambled_team_name = line[0]
            points = int(line[1])
            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(scrambled_team_name))  # Normalize team name
            if normalized_name not in scores:
                scores[normalized_name] = 0
            scores[normalized_name] += points
            index += 1
        
        # Sort the results first by score (descending) then by name (ascending)
        sorted_scores = sorted(scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
        
        # Prepare results for this test case
        for team_name, total_score in sorted_scores:
            results.append({team_name: total_score})  # Store as dictionary
    
    # Print all results
    print(results)

``` 

In this revised code:
- The results are now stored as dictionaries in a list, which matches the expected output format.
- The output is printed as a list of dictionaries after processing all test cases.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

-----Input:-----Input:
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
- 
Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
- 
Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

-----Output:-----Output:
For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order

- $1 \leq R \leq N \leq 1000$

Each team has a unique name, but the order of characters in the name does not matter (e.g., "abc" is the same as "cba"). After collecting scores from the teams, he wants to create a scoreboard that lists the teams and their total scores. The scoreboard should be sorted first by score in descending order, and if two teams have the same score, they should be sorted by their names in alphabetical order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of total submissions and the number of submissions in the first half hour.
   - Create a dictionary to store the total scores for each team, using a normalized version of the team name (sorted characters) as the key.
   - For the first half hour submissions, directly add the scores to the corresponding team in the dictionary.
   - For the remaining submissions, normalize the team names and add the scores to the corresponding entries in the dictionary.
   - Once all scores are collected, sort the teams first by score (in descending order) and then by name (in alphabetical order).
   - Print the sorted results.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function process_competition_scores():
       read T  // number of test cases
       for each test case:
           read N, R  // total submissions, submissions in first half hour
           scores = {}  // dictionary to hold team scores
           
           for i from 1 to R:
               read team_name, points
               if team_name not in scores:
                   scores[team_name] = 0
               scores[team_name] += points
           
           for i from R+1 to N:
               read scrambled_team_name, points
               normalized_name = sort(scrambled_team_name)
               if normalized_name not in scores:
                   scores[normalized_name] = 0
               scores[normalized_name] += points
           
           sorted_scores = sort(scores by score descending, then by name ascending)
           print sorted_scores
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a specified number of team submissions and their scores.
   - The output should be a list of teams with their total scores, sorted first by score in descending order and then by team name in lexicographical order.

2. **Identifying the Problem**:
   - The code is designed to read input from standard input and process it, but it seems that the output format is not matching the expected output.
   - The expected output format is a list of dictionaries, but the code is currently printing strings instead.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The code is not correctly formatting the output. Instead of printing the results directly, it should be collecting them in a specific format (as dictionaries) and then returning or printing that collection.
   - The normalization of team names is done correctly, but the way results are stored and printed does not match the expected output structure.

4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:
   - Change the way results are collected to match the expected output format (list of dictionaries).
   - Ensure that the output is printed in the correct format after processing all test cases.

Now, let's implement the necessary changes to the code to ensure it meets the requirements:

```python
def process_competition_scores():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R
        index += 1
        scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores
        
        # Process first half hour submissions
        for _ in range(R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space
            team_name = line[0]
            points = int(line[1])
            if team_name not in scores:
                scores[team_name] = 0
            scores[team_name] += points
            index += 1
        
        # Process remaining submissions
        for _ in range(N - R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space
            scrambled_team_name = line[0]
            points = int(line[1])
            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(scrambled_team_name))  # Normalize team name
            if normalized_name not in scores:
                scores[normalized_name] = 0
            scores[normalized_name] += points
            index += 1
        
        # Sort the results first by score (descending) then by name (ascending)
        sorted_scores = sorted(scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
        
        # Prepare results for this test case
        for team_name, total_score in sorted_scores:
            results.append({team_name: total_score})  # Store as dictionary
    
    # Print all results
    print(results)

``` 

In this revised code:
- The results are now stored as dictionaries in a list, which matches the expected output format.
- The output is printed as a list of dictionaries after processing all test cases.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by utilizing a dictionary to group problems by their difficulty scores. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:

    1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of problems (p) and subtasks (s) in a single line, which is efficient for handling input.

    2. **Using a Dictionary for Grouping**: Instead of maintaining a list of tuples for difficulties, the official solution uses a dictionary (`scores`) where the keys are the difficulty counts and the values are lists of problem indices. This allows for easy grouping and retrieval of problems with the same difficulty.

    3. **Score Calculation**: The solution pairs scores with the number of contestants who solved them using a dictionary (`nsc`). It then sorts the scores and counts how many times the number of contestants solving a subtask is greater than the next subtask. This is done using a simple loop over the sorted scores.

    4. **Sorting and Output**: After calculating the scores, the solution sorts the keys of the dictionary (the difficulty counts) and then sorts the problem indices for each difficulty before printing them. This ensures that the output is in the correct order.

    5. **Efficiency**: The use of dictionaries and sorting operations is efficient given the constraints, and the overall complexity remains manageable even for the upper limits of the input sizes.

    Overall, the official solution is insightful in its use of data structures to simplify the problem of grouping and sorting, which could be a useful approach in similar problems involving categorization and ordering based on computed values.

    # Print all results
    print("\n".join(results))

```

### Key Changes Made:
- The results are now formatted as strings in the form "team_name total_score" and collected in a list.
- The final output is printed as a single string with each result on a new line, which matches the expected output format.
- The normalization of team names is preserved to ensure that the same teams are correctly identified regardless of the order of characters in their names. 

This code should now correctly handle the input and produce the expected output format.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

-----Input:-----Input:
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
- 
Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
- 
Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

-----Output:-----Output:
For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order

-----Constraints-----Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq R \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq ti \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq pi \leq 10^6$
Sum of points ($pi$) of a team will not cross $10^9$.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Teacher Sungjae is organizing a programming competition and has a list of team submissions. Each team has a unique name, but the order of characters in the name does not matter (e.g., "abc" is the same as "cba"). After collecting scores from the teams, he wants to create a scoreboard that lists the teams and their total scores. The scoreboard should be sorted first by score in descending order, and if two teams have the same score, they should be sorted by their names in alphabetical order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of total submissions and the number of submissions in the first half hour.
   - Create a dictionary to store the total scores for each team, using a normalized version of the team name (sorted characters) as the key.
   - For the first half hour submissions, directly add the scores to the corresponding team in the dictionary.
   - For the remaining submissions, normalize the team names and add the scores to the corresponding entries in the dictionary.
   - Once all scores are collected, sort the teams first by score (in descending order) and then by name (in alphabetical order).
   - Print the sorted results.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function process_competition_scores():
       read T  // number of test cases
       for each test case:
           read N, R  // total submissions, submissions in first half hour
           scores = {}  // dictionary to hold team scores
           
           for i from 1 to R:
               read team_name, points
               if team_name not in scores:
                   scores[team_name] = 0
               scores[team_name] += points
           
           for i from R+1 to N:
               read scrambled_team_name, points
               normalized_name = sort(scrambled_team_name)
               if normalized_name not in scores:
                   scores[normalized_name] = 0
               scores[normalized_name] += points
           
           sorted_scores = sort(scores by score descending, then by name ascending)
           print sorted_scores
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a specified number of team submissions and their scores.
   - The output should be a list of teams with their total scores, sorted first by score in descending order and then by team name in lexicographical order.

2. **Identifying the Problem**:
   - The code is designed to read input from standard input and process it, but it seems that the output format is not matching the expected output.
   - The expected output format is a list of dictionaries, but the code is currently printing strings instead.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The code is not correctly formatting the output. Instead of printing the results directly, it should be collecting them in a specific format (as dictionaries) and then returning or printing that collection.
   - The normalization of team names is done correctly, but the way results are stored and printed does not match the expected output structure.

4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:
   - Change the way results are collected to match the expected output format (list of dictionaries).
   - Ensure that the output is printed in the correct format after processing all test cases.

Now, let's implement the necessary changes to the code to ensure it meets the requirements:

```python
def process_competition_scores():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R
        index += 1
        scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores
        
        # Process first half hour submissions
        for _ in range(R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space
            team_name = line[0]
            points = int(line[1])
            if team_name not in scores:
                scores[team_name] = 0
            scores[team_name] += points
            index += 1
        
        # Process remaining submissions
        for _ in range(N - R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space
            scrambled_team_name = line[0]
            points = int(line[1])
            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(scrambled_team_name))  # Normalize team name
            if normalized_name not in scores:
                scores[normalized_name] = 0
            scores[normalized_name] += points
            index += 1
        
        # Sort the results first by score (descending) then by name (ascending)
        sorted_scores = sorted(scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
        
        # Prepare results for this test case
        for team_name, total_score in sorted_scores:
            results.append({team_name: total_score})  # Store as dictionary
    
    # Print all results
    print(results)

``` 

In this revised code:
- The results are now stored as dictionaries in a list, which matches the expected output format.
- The output is printed as a list of dictionaries after processing all test cases.

Now, given your insights, try to fix the solution. 
Output a block of correct python3 code to be executed and evaluated again. 

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] Based on the insights and corrections needed, here is the revised Python code that correctly processes the input and outputs the results in the expected format:

```python
def process_competition_scores():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R
        index += 1
        scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores
        
        # Process first half hour submissions
        for _ in range(R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space
            team_name = line[0]

            if team_name not in scores:
                scores[team_name] = 0
            scores[team_name] += points
            index += 1
        
        # Process remaining submissions
        for _ in range(N - R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space
            scrambled_team_name = line[0]
            points = int(line[1])
            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(scrambled_team_name))  # Normalize team name
            if normalized_name not in scores:
                scores[normalized_name] = 0
            scores[normalized_name] += points
            index += 1
        
        # Sort the results first by score (descending) then by name (ascending)
        sorted_scores = sorted(scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
        
        # Prepare results for this test case
        for team_name, total_score in sorted_scores:
            results.append(f"{team_name} {total_score}")  # Store as formatted string
    
    # Print all results
    print("\n".join(results))

```

### Key Changes Made:
- The results are now formatted as strings in the form "team_name total_score" and collected in a list.
- The final output is printed as a single string with each result on a new line, which matches the expected output format.
- The normalization of team names is preserved to ensure that the same teams are correctly identified regardless of the order of characters in their names. 

This code should now correctly handle the input and produce the expected output format.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [generation text] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step again:

1. **Understanding the Expected Output**:
   - The expected output format is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains a team name and its corresponding score. For example, `{'iniciador': 11}`.
   - The output should not be a simple string but rather a structured format that matches the expected output.

2. **Identifying the Problem**:
   - The code currently collects results as formatted strings (e.g., `"team_name total_score"`) instead of dictionaries.
   - The output is printed as a single string, which does not match the expected output format of a list of dictionaries.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The results are not being stored in the correct format (as dictionaries) and are instead being formatted as strings.
   - The function `process_competition_scores()` is not being called, which means no output is generated when the code is executed.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

-----Input:-----Input:
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
- 
Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
- 
Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

-----Output:-----Output:
For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Teacher Sungjae is organizing a programming competition and has a list of team submissions. Each team has a unique name, but the order of characters in the name does not matter (e.g., "abc" is the same as "cba"). After collecting scores from the teams, he wants to create a scoreboard that lists the teams and their total scores. The scoreboard should be sorted first by score in descending order, and if two teams have the same score, they should be sorted by their names in alphabetical order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of total submissions and the number of submissions in the first half hour.
   - Create a dictionary to store the total scores for each team, using a normalized version of the team name (sorted characters) as the key.
   - For the first half hour submissions, directly add the scores to the corresponding team in the dictionary.
   - For the remaining submissions, normalize the team names and add the scores to the corresponding entries in the dictionary.
   - Once all scores are collected, sort the teams first by score (in descending order) and then by name (in alphabetical order).
   - Print the sorted results.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function process_competition_scores():
       read T  // number of test cases

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a specified number of team submissions and their scores.
   - The output should be a list of teams with their total scores, sorted first by score in descending order and then by team name in lexicographical order.

2. **Identifying the Problem**:
   - The code is designed to read input from standard input and process it, but it seems that the output format is not matching the expected output.
   - The expected output format is a list of dictionaries, but the code is currently printing strings instead.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The code is not correctly formatting the output. Instead of printing the results directly, it should be collecting them in a specific format (as dictionaries) and then returning or printing that collection.
   - The normalization of team names is done correctly, but the way results are stored and printed does not match the expected output structure.

4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:
   - Change the way results are collected to match the expected output format (list of dictionaries).
   - Ensure that the output is printed in the correct format after processing all test cases.

Now, let's implement the necessary changes to the code to ensure it meets the requirements:

```python
def process_competition_scores():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R
        index += 1
        scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores
        
        # Process first half hour submissions
        for _ in range(R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space
            team_name = line[0]
            points = int(line[1])
            if team_name not in scores:
                scores[team_name] = 0
            scores[team_name] += points
            index += 1
        
        # Process remaining submissions
        for _ in range(N - R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space
            scrambled_team_name = line[0]
            points = int(line[1])
            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(scrambled_team_name))  # Normalize team name
            if normalized_name not in scores:
                scores[normalized_name] = 0
            scores[normalized_name] += points
            index += 1
        
        # Sort the results first by score (descending) then by name (ascending)
        sorted_scores = sorted(scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
        
        # Prepare results for this test case
        for team_name, total_score in sorted_scores:
            results.append({team_name: total_score})  # Store as dictionary
    
    # Print all results
    print(results)

``` 

In this revised code:
- The results are now stored as dictionaries in a list, which matches the expected output format.
- The output is printed as a list of dictionaries after processing all test cases.

### Key Changes Made:
- The results are now formatted as strings in the form "team_name total_score" and collected in a list.
- The final output is printed as a single string with each result on a new line, which matches the expected output format.
- The normalization of team names is preserved to ensure that the same teams are correctly identified regardless of the order of characters in their names. 

This code should now correctly handle the input and produce the expected output format.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step again:

1. **Understanding the Expected Output**:
   - The expected output format is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains a team name and its corresponding score. For example, `{'iniciador': 11}`.
   - The output should not be a simple string but rather a structured format that matches the expected output.

Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by utilizing a dictionary to group problems by their difficulty scores. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:

    1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of problems (p) and subtasks (s) in a single line, which is efficient for handling input.

    2. **Using a Dictionary for Grouping**: Instead of maintaining a list of tuples for difficulties, the official solution uses a dictionary (`scores`) where the keys are the difficulty counts and the values are lists of problem indices. This allows for easy grouping and retrieval of problems with the same difficulty.

    3. **Score Calculation**: The solution pairs scores with the number of contestants who solved them using a dictionary (`nsc`). It then sorts the scores and counts how many times the number of contestants solving a subtask is greater than the next subtask. This is done using a simple loop over the sorted scores.

    4. **Sorting and Output**: After calculating the scores, the solution sorts the keys of the dictionary (the difficulty counts) and then sorts the problem indices for each difficulty before printing them. This ensures that the output is in the correct order.

    5. **Efficiency**: The use of dictionaries and sorting operations is efficient given the constraints, and the overall complexity remains manageable even for the upper limits of the input sizes.

    Overall, the official solution is insightful in its use of data structures to simplify the problem of grouping and sorting, which could be a useful approach in similar problems involving categorization and ordering based on computed values.

        for team_name, total_score in sorted_scores:
            results.append({team_name: total_score})  # Store as dictionary
    
    # Print all results
    print(results)

# Call the function to execute the logic
process_competition_scores()
```

### Key Changes Made:
- The results are now stored as dictionaries in a list, which matches the expected output format.
- The function `process_competition_scores()` is called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed and output is generated.

This code should now correctly handle the input and produce the expected output format.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

-----Input:-----Input:
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
- 
Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
- 
Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

-----Output:-----Output:
For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order

-----Constraints-----Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq R \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq ti \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq pi \leq 10^6$
Sum of points ($pi$) of a team will not cross $10^9$.

-----Sample Input:-----Sample Input:
1
10 5
amigoes  1
bannermen 1
monarchy 4
outliers 5
iniciador 10
aegimos 2
iiiacdnor 1
eilorstu 1
gimosae 3
mnachroy 7

-----Sample Output:-----Sample Output:
iniciador 11
monarchy 11
amigoes 6
outliers 6
bannermen 1

-----Explanation:-----Explanation:

$It$ $is$ $assured$ $that$ $each$ $team$ $will$ $submit$ $once$ $within$ $first$ $half$ $an$ $hour$.That means -                                          

that kind of submissions isn't possible within first half an hour.
Dataset can be huge. Use faster I/O method.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Teacher Sungjae is organizing a programming competition and has a list of team submissions. Each team has a unique name, but the order of characters in the name does not matter (e.g., "abc" is the same as "cba"). After collecting scores from the teams, he wants to create a scoreboard that lists the teams and their total scores. The scoreboard should be sorted first by score in descending order, and if two teams have the same score, they should be sorted by their names in alphabetical order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of total submissions and the number of submissions in the first half hour.
   - Create a dictionary to store the total scores for each team, using a normalized version of the team name (sorted characters) as the key.
   - For the first half hour submissions, directly add the scores to the corresponding team in the dictionary.
   - For the remaining submissions, normalize the team names and add the scores to the corresponding entries in the dictionary.
   - Once all scores are collected, sort the teams first by score (in descending order) and then by name (in alphabetical order).
   - Print the sorted results.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function process_competition_scores():
       read T  // number of test cases
       for each test case:
           read N, R  // total submissions, submissions in first half hour
           scores = {}  // dictionary to hold team scores
           
           for i from 1 to R:
               read team_name, points
               if team_name not in scores:
                   scores[team_name] = 0
               scores[team_name] += points
           
           for i from R+1 to N:
               read scrambled_team_name, points
               normalized_name = sort(scrambled_team_name)
               if normalized_name not in scores:
                   scores[normalized_name] = 0
               scores[normalized_name] += points
           
           sorted_scores = sort(scores by score descending, then by name ascending)
           print sorted_scores
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a specified number of team submissions and their scores.
   - The output should be a list of teams with their total scores, sorted first by score in descending order and then by team name in lexicographical order.

2. **Identifying the Problem**:
   - The code is designed to read input from standard input and process it, but it seems that the output format is not matching the expected output.
   - The expected output format is a list of dictionaries, but the code is currently printing strings instead.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The code is not correctly formatting the output. Instead of printing the results directly, it should be collecting them in a specific format (as dictionaries) and then returning or printing that collection.
   - The normalization of team names is done correctly, but the way results are stored and printed does not match the expected output structure.

4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:
   - Change the way results are collected to match the expected output format (list of dictionaries).
   - Ensure that the output is printed in the correct format after processing all test cases.

Now, let's implement the necessary changes to the code to ensure it meets the requirements:

```python
def process_competition_scores():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R
        index += 1
        scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores
        
        # Process first half hour submissions
        for _ in range(R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space
            team_name = line[0]
            points = int(line[1])
            if team_name not in scores:
                scores[team_name] = 0
            scores[team_name] += points
            index += 1
        
        # Process remaining submissions
        for _ in range(N - R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space
            scrambled_team_name = line[0]
            points = int(line[1])
            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(scrambled_team_name))  # Normalize team name
            if normalized_name not in scores:
                scores[normalized_name] = 0
            scores[normalized_name] += points
            index += 1
        
        # Sort the results first by score (descending) then by name (ascending)
        sorted_scores = sorted(scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))

            results.append({team_name: total_score})  # Store as dictionary
    
    # Print all results
    print(results)

``` 

In this revised code:
- The results are now stored as dictionaries in a list, which matches the expected output format.
- The output is printed as a list of dictionaries after processing all test cases.

### Key Changes Made:
- The results are now formatted as strings in the form "team_name total_score" and collected in a list.
- The final output is printed as a single string with each result on a new line, which matches the expected output format.
- The normalization of team names is preserved to ensure that the same teams are correctly identified regardless of the order of characters in their names.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step again:

1. **Understanding the Expected Output**:
   - The expected output format is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains a team name and its corresponding score. For example, `{'iniciador': 11}`.
   - The output should not be a simple string but rather a structured format that matches the expected output.

2. **Identifying the Problem**:
   - The code currently collects results as formatted strings (e.g., `"team_name total_score"`) instead of dictionaries.
   - The output is printed as a single string, which does not match the expected output format of a list of dictionaries.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The results are not being stored in the correct format (as dictionaries) and are instead being formatted as strings.
   - The function `process_competition_scores()` is not being called, which means no output is generated when the code is executed.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] Based on the insights and corrections needed, here is the revised Python code that correctly processes the input and outputs the results in the expected format:

```python
def process_competition_scores():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R
        index += 1
        scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores
        
        # Process first half hour submissions
        for _ in range(R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space

            points = int(line[1])
            if team_name not in scores:
                scores[team_name] = 0
            scores[team_name] += points
            index += 1
        
        # Process remaining submissions
        for _ in range(N - R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space

### Key Changes Made:
- The results are now stored as dictionaries in a list, which matches the expected output format.
- The function `process_competition_scores()` is called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed and output is generated.

This code should now correctly handle the input and produce the expected output format.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [generation text] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step again:

1. **Understanding the Expected Output**:
   - The expected output format is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains a team name and its corresponding score. For example, `{'iniciador': 11}`.
   - The output should not be a simple string but rather a structured format that matches the expected output.

2. **Identifying the Problem**:
   - The code currently collects results as dictionaries, but the normalization of team names is incorrect. The normalized names should be the original team names, not the sorted character strings.
   - The output is being printed as a single string representation of a list, which does not match the expected output format.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The normalization of team names is causing the original team names to be replaced with their sorted character versions, which is incorrect.
   - The results are being printed in a way that does not match the expected output format.

4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:
   - Ensure that the original team names are used for the output, while still using the sorted version for score aggregation.
   - Collect results in the correct format and print them in a way that matches the expected output.

Now, let's implement the necessary changes to the code to ensure it meets the requirements:

```python
def process_competition_scores():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R
        index += 1
        scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores
        
        # Process first half hour submissions
        for _ in range(R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space
            team_name = line[0]
            points = int(line[1])
            if team_name not in scores:
                scores[team_name] = 0
            scores[team_name] += points
            index += 1
        
        # Process remaining submissions
        for _ in range(N - R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space
            scrambled_team_name = line[0]
            points = int(line[1])
            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(scrambled_team_name))  # Normalize team name
            # Find the original team name that corresponds to the normalized name
            for original_name in scores.keys():
                if ''.join(sorted(original_name)) == normalized_name:
                    scores[original_name] += points
                    break
            index += 1
        
        # Sort the results first by score (descending) then by name (ascending)
        sorted_scores = sorted(scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
        
        # Prepare results for this test case
        for team_name, total_score in sorted_scores:
            results.append({team_name: total_score})  # Store as dictionary
    
    # Print all results
    print(results)

# Call the function to execute the logic
process_competition_scores()
```

### Key Changes Made:
- The code now correctly aggregates scores based on the original team names while still allowing for the normalization of scrambled names.
- The results are stored as dictionaries in a list, which matches the expected output format.
- The function `process_competition_scores()` is called at the end of the script to ensure that the logic is executed and output is generated.

This code should now correctly handle the input and produce the expected output format.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

-----Input:-----Input:
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
- 
Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
- 
Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

-----Output:-----Output:
For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order

-----Constraints-----Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq R \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq ti \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq pi \leq 10^6$
Sum of points ($pi$) of a team will not cross $10^9$.

-----Sample Input:-----Sample Input:
1
10 5
amigoes  1
bannermen 1
monarchy 4
outliers 5
iniciador 10
aegimos 2
iiiacdnor 1

gimosae 3
mnachroy 7

-----Sample Output:-----Sample Output:
iniciador 11

bannermen 1

-----Explanation:-----Explanation:

$It$ $is$ $assured$ $that$ $each$ $team$ $will$ $submit$ $once$ $within$ $first$ $half$ $an$ $hour$.That means -                                          

that kind of submissions isn't possible within first half an hour.
Dataset can be huge. Use faster I/O method.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Teacher Sungjae is organizing a programming competition and has a list of team submissions. Each team has a unique name, but the order of characters in the name does not matter (e.g., "abc" is the same as "cba"). After collecting scores from the teams, he wants to create a scoreboard that lists the teams and their total scores. The scoreboard should be sorted first by score in descending order, and if two teams have the same score, they should be sorted by their names in alphabetical order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of total submissions and the number of submissions in the first half hour.
   - Create a dictionary to store the total scores for each team, using a normalized version of the team name (sorted characters) as the key.
   - For the first half hour submissions, directly add the scores to the corresponding team in the dictionary.
   - For the remaining submissions, normalize the team names and add the scores to the corresponding entries in the dictionary.
   - Once all scores are collected, sort the teams first by score (in descending order) and then by name (in alphabetical order).
   - Print the sorted results.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function process_competition_scores():
       read T  // number of test cases
       for each test case:
           read N, R  // total submissions, submissions in first half hour
           scores = {}  // dictionary to hold team scores
           
           for i from 1 to R:
               read team_name, points
               if team_name not in scores:
                   scores[team_name] = 0

               if normalized_name not in scores:
                   scores[normalized_name] = 0
               scores[normalized_name] += points
           
           sorted_scores = sort(scores by score descending, then by name ascending)
           print sorted_scores
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a specified number of team submissions and their scores.
   - The output should be a list of teams with their total scores, sorted first by score in descending order and then by team name in lexicographical order.

2. **Identifying the Problem**:
   - The code is designed to read input from standard input and process it, but it seems that the output format is not matching the expected output.
   - The expected output format is a list of dictionaries, but the code is currently printing strings instead.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The code is not correctly formatting the output. Instead of printing the results directly, it should be collecting them in a specific format (as dictionaries) and then returning or printing that collection.
   - The normalization of team names is done correctly, but the way results are stored and printed does not match the expected output structure.

4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:
   - Change the way results are collected to match the expected output format (list of dictionaries).
   - Ensure that the output is printed in the correct format after processing all test cases.

Now, let's implement the necessary changes to the code to ensure it meets the requirements:

            results.append({team_name: total_score})  # Store as dictionary
    
    # Print all results
    print(results)

```

- The results are now stored as dictionaries in a list, which matches the expected output format.
- The output is printed as a list of dictionaries after processing all test cases.

            scores[normalized_name] += points
            index += 1
        
        # Sort the results first by score (descending) then by name (ascending)

            results.append(f"{team_name} {total_score}")  # Store as formatted string
    
    # Print all results
    print("\n".join(results))

```

### Key Changes Made:
- The results are now formatted as strings in the form "team_name total_score" and collected in a list.
- The final output is printed as a single string with each result on a new line, which matches the expected output format.
- The normalization of team names is preserved to ensure that the same teams are correctly identified regardless of the order of characters in their names. 

This code should now correctly handle the input and produce the expected output format.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step again:

1. **Understanding the Expected Output**:
   - The expected output format is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains a team name and its corresponding score. For example, `{'iniciador': 11}`.
   - The output should not be a simple string but rather a structured format that matches the expected output.

2. **Identifying the Problem**:
   - The code currently collects results as formatted strings (e.g., `"team_name total_score"`) instead of dictionaries.
   - The output is printed as a single string, which does not match the expected output format of a list of dictionaries.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The results are not being stored in the correct format (as dictionaries) and are instead being formatted as strings.
   - The function `process_competition_scores()` is not being called, which means no output is generated when the code is executed.

4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:
   - Change the way results are collected to ensure they are stored as dictionaries in a list.
   - Ensure that the function is called at the end of the script to execute the logic and produce output.

Now, let's implement the necessary changes to the code to ensure it meets the requirements:

```python
def process_competition_scores():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R
        index += 1
        scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores
        
        # Process first half hour submissions
        for _ in range(R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space
            team_name = line[0]
            points = int(line[1])
            if team_name not in scores:
                scores[team_name] = 0
            scores[team_name] += points
            index += 1
        
        # Process remaining submissions
        for _ in range(N - R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space
            scrambled_team_name = line[0]
            points = int(line[1])
            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(scrambled_team_name))  # Normalize team name
            if normalized_name not in scores:

Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by utilizing a dictionary to group problems by their difficulty scores. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:

    1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of problems (p) and subtasks (s) in a single line, which is efficient for handling input.

    2. **Using a Dictionary for Grouping**: Instead of maintaining a list of tuples for difficulties, the official solution uses a dictionary (`scores`) where the keys are the difficulty counts and the values are lists of problem indices. This allows for easy grouping and retrieval of problems with the same difficulty.

    3. **Score Calculation**: The solution pairs scores with the number of contestants who solved them using a dictionary (`nsc`). It then sorts the scores and counts how many times the number of contestants solving a subtask is greater than the next subtask. This is done using a simple loop over the sorted scores.

    4. **Sorting and Output**: After calculating the scores, the solution sorts the keys of the dictionary (the difficulty counts) and then sorts the problem indices for each difficulty before printing them. This ensures that the output is in the correct order.

    5. **Efficiency**: The use of dictionaries and sorting operations is efficient given the constraints, and the overall complexity remains manageable even for the upper limits of the input sizes.

    Overall, the official solution is insightful in its use of data structures to simplify the problem of grouping and sorting, which could be a useful approach in similar problems involving categorization and ordering based on computed values.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

-----Input:-----Input:
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
- 
Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
- 
Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

-----Output:-----Output:
For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order

-----Constraints-----Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq R \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq ti \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq pi \leq 10^6$
Sum of points ($pi$) of a team will not cross $10^9$.

-----Sample Input:-----Sample Input:
1
10 5
amigoes  1
bannermen 1
monarchy 4
outliers 5
iniciador 10
aegimos 2
iiiacdnor 1
eilorstu 1
gimosae 3
mnachroy 7

-----Sample Output:-----Sample Output:
iniciador 11
monarchy 11
amigoes 6
outliers 6
bannermen 1

-----Explanation:-----Explanation:

$It$ $is$ $assured$ $that$ $each$ $team$ $will$ $submit$ $once$ $within$ $first$ $half$ $an$ $hour$.That means -                                          

that kind of submissions isn't possible within first half an hour.
Dataset can be huge. Use faster I/O method.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Teacher Sungjae is organizing a programming competition and has a list of team submissions. Each team has a unique name, but the order of characters in the name does not matter (e.g., "abc" is the same as "cba"). After collecting scores from the teams, he wants to create a scoreboard that lists the teams and their total scores. The scoreboard should be sorted first by score in descending order, and if two teams have the same score, they should be sorted by their names in alphabetical order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of total submissions and the number of submissions in the first half hour.
   - Create a dictionary to store the total scores for each team, using a normalized version of the team name (sorted characters) as the key.
   - For the first half hour submissions, directly add the scores to the corresponding team in the dictionary.
   - For the remaining submissions, normalize the team names and add the scores to the corresponding entries in the dictionary.
   - Once all scores are collected, sort the teams first by score (in descending order) and then by name (in alphabetical order).
   - Print the sorted results.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function process_competition_scores():
       read T  // number of test cases
       for each test case:
           read N, R  // total submissions, submissions in first half hour
           scores = {}  // dictionary to hold team scores
           
           for i from 1 to R:
               read team_name, points
               if team_name not in scores:
                   scores[team_name] = 0
               scores[team_name] += points
           
           for i from R+1 to N:
               read scrambled_team_name, points
               normalized_name = sort(scrambled_team_name)
               if normalized_name not in scores:
                   scores[normalized_name] = 0
               scores[normalized_name] += points
           
           sorted_scores = sort(scores by score descending, then by name ascending)
           print sorted_scores
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a specified number of team submissions and their scores.
   - The output should be a list of teams with their total scores, sorted first by score in descending order and then by team name in lexicographical order.

2. **Identifying the Problem**:
   - The code is designed to read input from standard input and process it, but it seems that the output format is not matching the expected output.
   - The expected output format is a list of dictionaries, but the code is currently printing strings instead.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The code is not correctly formatting the output. Instead of printing the results directly, it should be collecting them in a specific format (as dictionaries) and then returning or printing that collection.
   - The normalization of team names is done correctly, but the way results are stored and printed does not match the expected output structure.

4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:
   - Change the way results are collected to match the expected output format (list of dictionaries).
   - Ensure that the output is printed in the correct format after processing all test cases.

Now, let's implement the necessary changes to the code to ensure it meets the requirements:

```python
def process_competition_scores():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R
        index += 1
        scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores
        
        # Process first half hour submissions
        for _ in range(R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space
            team_name = line[0]
            points = int(line[1])
            if team_name not in scores:
                scores[team_name] = 0
            scores[team_name] += points
            index += 1
        
        # Process remaining submissions
        for _ in range(N - R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space
            scrambled_team_name = line[0]
            points = int(line[1])
            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(scrambled_team_name))  # Normalize team name
            if normalized_name not in scores:
                scores[normalized_name] = 0
            scores[normalized_name] += points
            index += 1
        
        # Sort the results first by score (descending) then by name (ascending)
        sorted_scores = sorted(scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
        
        # Prepare results for this test case
        for team_name, total_score in sorted_scores:
            results.append({team_name: total_score})  # Store as dictionary
    
    # Print all results
    print(results)

``` 

In this revised code:
- The results are now stored as dictionaries in a list, which matches the expected output format.
- The output is printed as a list of dictionaries after processing all test cases.

Now, given your insights, try to fix the solution. 
Output a block of correct python3 code to be executed and evaluated again. 

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] Based on the insights and corrections needed, here is the revised Python code that correctly processes the input and outputs the results in the expected format:

```python
def process_competition_scores():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R
        index += 1

            results.append(f"{team_name} {total_score}")  # Store as formatted string
    
    # Print all results
    print("\n".join(results))

```

### Key Changes Made:
- The results are now formatted as strings in the form "team_name total_score" and collected in a list.
- The final output is printed as a single string with each result on a new line, which matches the expected output format.
- The normalization of team names is preserved to ensure that the same teams are correctly identified regardless of the order of characters in their names. 

This code should now correctly handle the input and produce the expected output format.

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step again:

1. **Understanding the Expected Output**:
   - The expected output format is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains a team name and its corresponding score. For example, `{'iniciador': 11}`.
   - The output should not be a simple string but rather a structured format that matches the expected output.

2. **Identifying the Problem**:
   - The code currently collects results as formatted strings (e.g., `"team_name total_score"`) instead of dictionaries.
   - The output is printed as a single string, which does not match the expected output format of a list of dictionaries.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The results are not being stored in the correct format (as dictionaries) and are instead being formatted as strings.
   - The function `process_competition_scores()` is not being called, which means no output is generated when the code is executed.

4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:
   - Change the way results are collected to ensure they are stored as dictionaries in a list.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step again:

1. **Understanding the Expected Output**:
   - The expected output format is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains a team name and its corresponding score. For example, `{'iniciador': 11}`.
   - The output should not be a simple string but rather a structured format that matches the expected output.

2. **Identifying the Problem**:
   - The code currently collects results as dictionaries, but the normalization of team names is incorrect. The normalized names should be the original team names, not the sorted character strings.
   - The output is being printed as a single string representation of a list, which does not match the expected output format.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The normalization of team names is causing the original team names to be replaced with their sorted character versions, which is incorrect.
   - The results are being printed in a way that does not match the expected output format.

4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:
   - Ensure that the original team names are used for the output, while still using the sorted version for score aggregation.
   - Collect results in the correct format and print them in a way that matches the expected output.

Now, let's implement the necessary changes to the code to ensure it meets the requirements:

```python
def process_competition_scores():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):

        index += 1
        scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores
        
        # Process first half hour submissions
        for _ in range(R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space
            team_name = line[0]
            points = int(line[1])
            if team_name not in scores:
                scores[team_name] = 0
            scores[team_name] += points
            index += 1
        
        # Process remaining submissions
        for _ in range(N - R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space
            scrambled_team_name = line[0]
            points = int(line[1])
            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(scrambled_team_name))  # Normalize team name
            # Find the original team name that corresponds to the normalized name
            for original_name in scores.keys():
                if ''.join(sorted(original_name)) == normalized_name:
                    scores[original_name] += points
                    break
            index += 1
        
        # Sort the results first by score (descending) then by name (ascending)
        sorted_scores = sorted(scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
        
        # Prepare results for this test case
        for team_name, total_score in sorted_scores:

    # Print all results
    print(results)

# Call the function to execute the logic

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to process team submissions for a programming competition, where team names could be scrambled but still represented the same team. The output needed to be a scoreboard sorted by scores in descending order and by team names in lexicographical order when scores were tied.

### Key Concepts:
- **Normalization of Team Names**: The core concept was to normalize team names by sorting their characters to handle the scrambled submissions correctly.
- **Score Aggregation**: Scores needed to be aggregated based on the normalized team names while retaining the original names for output.

### Strategies and Issues:
- Initially, I stored results as formatted strings instead of dictionaries, which did not match the expected output format. The output needed to be a list of dictionaries, each containing a team name and its score.
- I also faced issues with correctly identifying the original team names from the normalized names, leading to incorrect score aggregation.

### Fixes:
- I corrected the output format by ensuring results were stored as dictionaries.
- I implemented a loop to match normalized names with their original counterparts for accurate score aggregation.
- The final output was printed as a list of dictionaries, which aligned with the expected output format.

### Final Code Snippet:

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Teacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.
$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. 
That means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').
It is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.

-----Input:-----Input:
- 
First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- 
The first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. 
- 
Then $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.
- 
Then $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.

-----Output:-----Output:
For each testcase,print the scoreboard.
That means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order

-----Constraints-----Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq R \leq N \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq ti \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq pi \leq 10^6$
Sum of points ($pi$) of a team will not cross $10^9$.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Teacher Sungjae is organizing a programming competition and has a list of team submissions. Each team has a unique name, but the order of characters in the name does not matter (e.g., "abc" is the same as "cba"). After collecting scores from the teams, he wants to create a scoreboard that lists the teams and their total scores. The scoreboard should be sorted first by score in descending order, and if two teams have the same score, they should be sorted by their names in alphabetical order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of total submissions and the number of submissions in the first half hour.
   - Create a dictionary to store the total scores for each team, using a normalized version of the team name (sorted characters) as the key.
   - For the first half hour submissions, directly add the scores to the corresponding team in the dictionary.
   - For the remaining submissions, normalize the team names and add the scores to the corresponding entries in the dictionary.
   - Once all scores are collected, sort the teams first by score (in descending order) and then by name (in alphabetical order).
   - Print the sorted results.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function process_competition_scores():
       read T  // number of test cases
       for each test case:
           read N, R  // total submissions, submissions in first half hour
           scores = {}  // dictionary to hold team scores
           
           for i from 1 to R:
               read team_name, points
               if team_name not in scores:
                   scores[team_name] = 0
               scores[team_name] += points
           
           for i from R+1 to N:
               read scrambled_team_name, points
               normalized_name = sort(scrambled_team_name)

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a specified number of team submissions and their scores.
   - The output should be a list of teams with their total scores, sorted first by score in descending order and then by team name in lexicographical order.

2. **Identifying the Problem**:
   - The code is designed to read input from standard input and process it, but it seems that the output format is not matching the expected output.
   - The expected output format is a list of dictionaries, but the code is currently printing strings instead.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The code is not correctly formatting the output. Instead of printing the results directly, it should be collecting them in a specific format (as dictionaries) and then returning or printing that collection.
   - The normalization of team names is done correctly, but the way results are stored and printed does not match the expected output structure.

4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:
   - Change the way results are collected to match the expected output format (list of dictionaries).
   - Ensure that the output is printed in the correct format after processing all test cases.

Now, let's implement the necessary changes to the code to ensure it meets the requirements:

```python
def process_competition_scores():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R
        index += 1
        scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores
        
        # Process first half hour submissions
        for _ in range(R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space
            team_name = line[0]
            points = int(line[1])
            if team_name not in scores:
                scores[team_name] = 0
            scores[team_name] += points
            index += 1
        
        # Process remaining submissions
        for _ in range(N - R):
            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space
            scrambled_team_name = line[0]
            points = int(line[1])
            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(scrambled_team_name))  # Normalize team name
            if normalized_name not in scores:
                scores[normalized_name] = 0
            scores[normalized_name] += points
            index += 1
        
        # Sort the results first by score (descending) then by name (ascending)
        sorted_scores = sorted(scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
        
        # Prepare results for this test case
        for team_name, total_score in sorted_scores:
            results.append({team_name: total_score})  # Store as dictionary
    
    # Print all results
    print(results)

``` 

In this revised code:
- The results are now stored as dictionaries in a list, which matches the expected output format.
- The output is printed as a list of dictionaries after processing all test cases.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] Based on the insights and corrections needed, here is the revised Python code that correctly processes the input and outputs the results in the expected format:

```python
def process_competition_scores():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R
        index += 1

            results.append(f"{team_name} {total_score}")  # Store as formatted string
    
    # Print all results
    print("\n".join(results))

```

### Key Changes Made:
- The results are now formatted as strings in the form "team_name total_score" and collected in a list.
- The final output is printed as a single string with each result on a new line, which matches the expected output format.
- The normalization of team names is preserved to ensure that the same teams are correctly identified regardless of the order of characters in their names. 

This code should now correctly handle the input and produce the expected output format.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step again:

1. **Understanding the Expected Output**:
   - The expected output format is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains a team name and its corresponding score. For example, `{'iniciador': 11}`.
   - The output should not be a simple string but rather a structured format that matches the expected output.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 586 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to aggregate scores for programming competition teams, where team names could be presented in any order of characters. The main challenge was to ensure that the scores were correctly attributed to the original team names despite the scrambled submissions.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:
1. **Input Handling**: The official solution efficiently reads input using `input()` and processes it in a loop for multiple test cases. This is a straightforward approach that ensures clarity and simplicity.

2. **Data Structures**: 
   - The solution uses a list `a` to store scores and team names, and another list `sr` to store sorted versions of the team names. This allows for easy comparison between the original and scrambled names.
   - The use of a tuple-like structure (`[10**10 - y, x]`) allows for easy score management, where the score is adjusted by subtracting the points from a large constant.

3. **Normalization**: The official solution sorts the team names to create a normalized version, which is then used for comparison. This is a crucial step that ensures that different permutations of the same team name are treated as equivalent.

4. **Score Adjustment**: The solution iterates through the remaining submissions and adjusts the scores based on the normalized names. This is done efficiently by checking against the pre-sorted list of team names.

5. **Sorting and Output**: Finally, the results are sorted based on scores and printed in the required format. The use of `abs(i[0] - 10**10)` to retrieve the actual score is a clever way to maintain the original score structure while ensuring clarity in output.

### Reflection on My Attempts:
- My initial approach failed primarily due to incorrect handling of team name normalization and output formatting. I mistakenly used sorted character strings as keys for score aggregation, which led to mismatches in team names.
- The official solution's method of maintaining a separate list for sorted names and using it for comparison was more effective and straightforward.
- I learned the importance of clearly defining data structures and ensuring that the output format matches the expected results. The official solution's approach to score management and normalization provided a clearer path to solving the problem efficiently. 

Overall, this experience highlighted the significance of careful input handling, data structure choice, and output formatting in competitive programming.
