    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   Teacher Sungjae is organizing a programming competition and has a list of team submissions. Each team has a unique name, but the order of characters in the name does not matter (e.g., \"abc\" is the same as \"cba\"). After collecting scores from the teams, he wants to create a scoreboard that lists the teams and their total scores. The scoreboard should be sorted first by score in descending order, and if two teams have the same score, they should be sorted by their names in alphabetical order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   - Read the number of test cases.\n   - For each test case, read the number of total submissions and the number of submissions in the first half hour.\n   - Create a dictionary to store the total scores for each team, using a normalized version of the team name (sorted characters) as the key.\n   - For the first half hour submissions, directly add the scores to the corresponding team in the dictionary.\n   - For the remaining submissions, normalize the team names and add the scores to the corresponding entries in the dictionary.\n   - Once all scores are collected, sort the teams first by score (in descending order) and then by name (in alphabetical order).\n   - Print the sorted results.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function process_competition_scores():\n       read T  // number of test cases\n       for each test case:\n           read N, R  // total submissions, submissions in first half hour\n           scores = {}  // dictionary to hold team scores\n           \n           for i from 1 to R:\n               read team_name, points\n               if team_name not in scores:\n                   scores[team_name] = 0\n               scores[team_name] += points\n           \n           for i from R+1 to N:\n               read scrambled_team_name, points\n               normalized_name = sort(scrambled_team_name)\n               if normalized_name not in scores:\n                   scores[normalized_name] = 0\n               scores[normalized_name] += points\n           \n           sorted_scores = sort(scores by score descending, then by name ascending)\n           print sorted_scores\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef process_competition_scores():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R\n        index += 1\n        scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores\n        \n        # Process first half hour submissions\n        for _ in range(R):\n            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space\n            team_name = line[0]\n            points = int(line[1])\n            if team_name not in scores:\n                scores[team_name] = 0\n            scores[team_name] += points\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Process remaining submissions\n        for _ in range(N - R):\n            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on last space\n            scrambled_team_name = line[0]\n            points = int(line[1])\n            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(scrambled_team_name))  # Normalize team name\n            if normalized_name not in scores:\n                scores[normalized_name] = 0\n            scores[normalized_name] += points\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Sort the results first by score (descending) then by name (ascending)\n        sorted_scores = sorted(scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n        \n        # Prepare results for this test case\n        for team_name, total_score in sorted_scores:\n            results.append(f\"{team_name} {total_score}\")\n    \n    # Print all results\n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\n```",
