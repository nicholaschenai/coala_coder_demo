Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:\n- White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval\n- Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.\n- Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.\n- Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.\nYou want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.\n- The $i^{\\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\\text{th}}$ interval.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $ 1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5 $\n- $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 $\n- The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.\n- $ 1 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \\leq i \\leq n$.\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n1\n3\n3 7\n2 5\n6 9\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n100\n\n-----Explanation:-----\nThe intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:\n- $[2, 3) \\cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.\n- $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.\n- $[3, 5] \\cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.\n- Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.\nPlease note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.\nNote that 011 is also a valid output.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The solution involved tracking the current achievable temperature range and updating it based on the time elapsed since the last customer.\n\n    The core concept was to maintain a range of possible temperatures that could be achieved by the air conditioner, which can either heat, cool, or remain off. For each customer, we calculated the time passed since the last customer and adjusted the temperature range accordingly. We then checked if the current range overlapped with the customer's preferred range. If at any point the ranges did not overlap, it was impossible to satisfy that customer.\n\n    The implemented solution was efficient and handled multiple test cases as required. The final code successfully passed all provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was correct. The key takeaway was the importance of managing state changes over time and ensuring that the temperature adjustments were feasible within the constraints given by each customer's preferences. \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_satisfy_customers(test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            n, m = case[0], case[1]  # number of customers and initial temperature\n            current_time = 0\n            current_min_temp = m\n            current_max_temp = m\n        \n            for i in range(n):\n                t_i, l_i, h_i = case[2][i]  # customer visit time and preferred temperature range\n                time_passed = t_i - current_time\n            \n                # Update the current temperature range based on time passed\n                current_min_temp -= time_passed\n                current_max_temp += time_passed\n            \n                # Update the current time to the customer's visit time\n                current_time = t_i\n            \n                # Adjust the current temperature range to the customer's preferred range\n                current_min_temp = max(current_min_temp, l_i)\n                current_max_temp = min(current_max_temp, h_i)\n            \n                # If the ranges do not overlap, print \"NO\" and break\n                if current_min_temp > current_max_temp:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    break\n            else:\n                # If all customers can be satisfied, print \"YES\"\n                print(\"YES\")\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process and the solution's effectiveness, which can be referenced for similar future problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The challenge involved correctly identifying overlaps and implementing a coloring strategy that maximizes the green area.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n1. **Interval Overlap:** Understanding how to determine if two intervals overlap is crucial. An interval `[L1, R1]` overlaps with another interval `[L2, R2]` if `L2 <= R1`.\n2. **Greedy Coloring Strategy:** The initial approach involved sorting the intervals and attempting to color them based on their order. However, this simplistic approach failed to account for multiple overlaps and did not maximize the green area effectively.\n\n### Strategies Attempted:\n- **Sorting and Iterating:** The intervals were sorted by their starting points, and a greedy approach was used to color them based on overlaps with the previous interval. This led to incorrect results as it did not consider all possible overlaps.\n- **Output Handling:** The results were stored in a list and printed at once, which was correct, but the logic for determining the colors was flawed.\n\n### Errors and Fixes:\n- The main error was in the overlap handling logic, which did not effectively maximize the green area. The solution needed a more comprehensive approach to analyze all intervals and their overlaps.\n- The final solution should have implemented a more robust strategy to ensure that overlapping intervals were colored in a way that maximized the green area.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe attempts highlighted the importance of correctly managing interval overlaps and the need for a more sophisticated approach to coloring strategies. Future solutions should focus on analyzing all overlaps comprehensively rather than relying on a simple greedy method."

        "content": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\nIn my attempts to solve the problem of maximizing the green area by coloring intervals, I learned several key insights about the approach and logic required to tackle such problems effectively.\n\n1. **Understanding Overlaps:**\n   The primary challenge was correctly identifying and managing overlaps between intervals. My initial approach focused on a simplistic overlap check, which did not account for the complexity of multiple overlapping intervals. The official solution effectively uses a sorted list of intervals to manage overlaps and color them appropriately.\n\n2. **Coloring Strategy:**\n   The official solution employs a clever strategy using a counter (`c`) to alternate colors based on the maximum right endpoint encountered so far (`maxi`). This allows it to efficiently decide whether to color the current interval the same as or differently from the previous one, depending on whether it overlaps or not. My approach failed to implement this alternating logic effectively, leading to incorrect results.\n\n3. **Sorting and Indexing:**\n   The official solution sorts the intervals based on their starting points and maintains their original indices. This is crucial for ensuring that the output matches the input order. My attempts did not adequately preserve the original order after sorting, which contributed to the incorrect output.\n\n4. **Efficiency:**\n   The official solution is efficient in both time and space complexity, processing each interval in a single pass after sorting. My approach, while attempting to handle overlaps, became convoluted and did not achieve the same level of efficiency.\n\n### Key Takeaways:\n- Always consider how to manage overlaps in a structured way, possibly using sorting and a systematic coloring strategy.\n- Maintain the original indices when sorting to ensure the output matches the expected order.\n- Use flags or counters to manage state changes (like color alternation) effectively.\n\nThe official solution's approach is a valuable reference for similar problems in the future, emphasizing the importance of clear logic and efficient data handling."
