    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to color a set of intervals on the X-axis either blue or yellow in such a way that the total length of the area that is colored green (where both blue and yellow intervals overlap) is maximized. Each interval can only be colored one way, and we want to find a coloring scheme that achieves this goal.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To maximize the green area, we should look for overlaps between intervals. If two intervals overlap, we can color one blue and the other yellow to create a green area. If an interval does not overlap with any other, we can color it either blue or yellow without affecting the green area. The strategy will involve sorting the intervals and checking for overlaps, then deciding on the color based on the overlaps found.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read number of intervals n\n           read intervals into a list\n           sort intervals by their starting point\n           initialize a result string of length n with '0's\n           for i from 0 to n-1:\n               if current interval overlaps with previous:\n                   color current interval yellow (1)\n                   color previous interval blue (0)\n               else:\n                   color current interval blue (0)\n           output the result string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):\n    for intervals in test_cases:\n        n = intervals[0]  # number of intervals\n        interval_list = intervals[1:]  # list of intervals\n        # Sort intervals based on their starting point\n        interval_list.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n        \n        result = ['0'] * n  # Initialize result with all blue (0)\n        \n        # Iterate through the sorted intervals\n        for i in range(n):\n            if i > 0:  # Check for overlap with the previous interval\n                L_prev, R_prev = interval_list[i - 1]\n                L_curr, R_curr = interval_list[i]\n                if L_curr <= R_prev:  # There is an overlap\n                    result[i - 1] = '0'  # Color previous blue\n                    result[i] = '1'      # Color current yellow\n                else:\n                    result[i] = '0'  # No overlap, color current blue\n        \n        # Output the result as a string\n        print(''.join(result))\n\n# Read input and call the function\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    n = int(input())\n    intervals = []\n    for __ in range(n):\n        L, R = map(int, input().split())\n        intervals.append((L, R))\n    test_cases.append((n, *intervals))\n\nmaximize_green_intervals(test_cases)\n```",
