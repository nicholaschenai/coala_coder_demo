For each vertex from 1 to N, we need to find the longest increasing subsequence of the values along the shortest path from vertex 1 to that vertex.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - First, we need to represent the tree using an adjacency list since it allows us to easily traverse the tree.\n   - We will perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from vertex 1 to find the path to each vertex k.\n   - For each path found, we will extract the values associated with the vertices in that path.\n   - We will then calculate the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) for the extracted values using a dynamic programming approach.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function longest_increasing_subsequence(sequence):\n       initialize dp array with 1s of length equal to sequence length\n       for i from 1 to length of sequence:\n           for j from 0 to i-1:\n               if sequence[j] < sequence[i]:\n                   dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n       return max(dp)\n\n   function dfs(current_vertex, parent):\n       add current_vertex to path\n       for each neighbor of current_vertex:\n           if neighbor is not parent:\n               dfs(neighbor, current_vertex)\n       if current_vertex is a leaf:\n           calculate LIS for path\n           store the result\n       remove current_vertex from path\n\n   read N\n   read values for vertices\n   build adjacency list for the tree\n   initialize result list\n   call dfs starting from vertex 1\n   print results\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef longest_increasing_subsequence(sequence):\n    # Initialize a dp array where each element starts with 1\n    dp = [1] * len(sequence)\n    # Calculate the length of the longest increasing subsequence\n    for i in range(1, len(sequence)):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if sequence[j] < sequence[i]:\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n    return max(dp)\n\ndef dfs(current_vertex, parent, graph, values, path, results):\n    # Add the current vertex value to the path\n    path.append(values[current_vertex - 1])\n    # Check if we reached a leaf node\n    is_leaf = True\n    for neighbor in graph[current_vertex]:\n        if neighbor != parent:\n            is_leaf = False\n            dfs(neighbor, current_vertex, graph, values, path, results)\n    if is_leaf:\n        # Calculate the LIS for the current path\n        lis_length = longest_increasing_subsequence(path)\n        results[current_vertex] = lis_length\n    # Backtrack by removing the current vertex value from the path\n    path.pop()\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])  # Number of vertices\n    values = list(map(int, data[1].split()))  # Values at each vertex\n    graph = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]  # Adjacency list for the tree\n    \n    # Build the graph from the input edges\n    for i in range(2, N + 1):\n        u, v = map(int, data[i].split())\n        graph[u].append(v)\n        graph[v].append(u)\n    \n    results = [0] * (N + 1)  # To store the results for each vertex\n    dfs(1, -1, graph, values, [], results)  # Start DFS from vertex 1\n    \n    # Print the results for vertices 1 to N\n    for k in range(1, N + 1):\n        print(results[k])\n\nmain()\n```",
