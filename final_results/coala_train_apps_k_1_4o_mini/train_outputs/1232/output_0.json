    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to determine the probability \\( p \\) such that when we randomly set input bits to 1 with probability \\( p \\), the output of a digital circuit (composed of AND and OR gates) is 1 with a probability of exactly 1/2. The circuit is defined by a series of nodes, where each node can either be an input (0) or a gate (1 for OR, 2 for AND) that takes inputs from previous nodes.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we will represent the circuit as a directed graph where nodes are either inputs or gates. We will calculate the probability of the output node being 1 based on the probabilities of the input nodes being 1. For each gate, we can derive the output probability based on the probabilities of its inputs. Specifically:\n   - For an AND gate, the output is 1 if both inputs are 1, so the probability is \\( P(A \\text{ AND } B) = P(A) \\times P(B) \\).\n   - For an OR gate, the output is 1 if at least one input is 1, so the probability is \\( P(A \\text{ OR } B) = 1 - (1 - P(A)) \\times (1 - P(B)) \\).\n   We will use a binary search to find the value of \\( p \\) that results in the output probability being exactly 1/2.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function find_probability(test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           initialize nodes array\n           read number of nodes\n           for i from 1 to n:\n               read node description\n               if node is input:\n                   set probability to 0\n               else if node is OR:\n                   calculate probability based on inputs\n               else if node is AND:\n                   calculate probability based on inputs\n           use binary search to find p such that output probability is 1/2\n           store result\n       return results\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef find_probability(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        n = case[0]  # number of nodes\n        nodes = case[1:]  # node descriptions\n        probabilities = [0] * n  # to store probabilities of each node\n        \n        # Calculate probabilities for each node\n        for i in range(n):\n            if nodes[i][0] == 0:  # Input node\n                probabilities[i] = 0  # Probability of input is 0\n            elif nodes[i][0] == 1:  # OR gate\n                a, b = nodes[i][1] - 1, nodes[i][2] - 1  # get input indices\n                probabilities[i] = 1 - (1 - probabilities[a]) * (1 - probabilities[b])\n            elif nodes[i][0] == 2:  # AND gate\n                a, b = nodes[i][1] - 1, nodes[i][2] - 1  # get input indices\n                probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]\n        \n        # Binary search for p such that probabilities[n-1] = 1/2\n        low, high = 0.0, 1.0\n        while high - low > 1e-7:  # precision threshold\n            mid = (low + high) / 2\n            # Update probabilities based on mid\n            for i in range(n):\n                if nodes[i][0] == 0:  # Input node\n                    probabilities[i] = mid\n                elif nodes[i][0] == 1:  # OR gate\n                    a, b = nodes[i][1] - 1, nodes[i][2] - 1\n                    probabilities[i] = 1 - (1 - probabilities[a]) * (1 - probabilities[b])\n                elif nodes[i][0] == 2:  # AND gate\n                    a, b = nodes[i][1] - 1, nodes[i][2] - 1\n                    probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]\n            \n            if probabilities[n-1] < 0.5:\n                low = mid\n            else:\n                high = mid\n        \n        results.append(f\"{(low + high) / 2:.5f}\")  # Store result with 5 decimal places\n    \n    return results\n```",
