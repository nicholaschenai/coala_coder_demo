    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to determine the probability \\( p \\) such that the output of a digital circuit (composed of AND and OR gates) is 1 with a probability of exactly 1/2. The circuit is defined by nodes that can either be inputs or gates, and the challenge involved calculating the output probabilities based on the structure of the circuit.\n\nKey concepts involved included:\n- Understanding how to compute probabilities for AND and OR gates based on their inputs.\n- Implementing a binary search to find the value of \\( p \\) that results in the desired output probability.\n\nThroughout the attempts, the main issues encountered were related to input handling and output formatting. The input needed to be parsed correctly, especially with blank lines separating test cases. Additionally, the results needed to be printed in a specific format, which was not initially addressed.\n\nThe final solution involved reading input from standard input, processing it to extract test cases, and then calculating the probabilities using a binary search. The results were formatted to five decimal places before being printed. \n\nThe final code snippet that encapsulated the solution is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef find_probability(test_cases):\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        n = case[0]  # number of nodes\n        nodes = case[1:]  # node descriptions\n        probabilities = [0] * n  # to store probabilities of each node\n        \n        # Binary search for p such that probabilities[n-1] = 1/2\n        low, high = 0.0, 1.0\n        while high - low > 1e-7:  # precision threshold\n            mid = (low + high) / 2\n            \n            # Update probabilities based on mid\n            for i in range(n):\n                if nodes[i][0] == 0:  # Input node\n                    probabilities[i] = mid\n                elif nodes[i][0] == 1:  # OR gate\n                    a, b = nodes[i][1] - 1, nodes[i][2] - 1\n                    probabilities[i] = 1 - (1 - probabilities[a]) * (1 - probabilities[b])\n                elif nodes[i][0] == 2:  # AND gate\n                    a, b = nodes[i][1] - 1, nodes[i][2] - 1\n                    probabilities[i] = probabilities[a] * probabilities[b]\n            \n            if probabilities[n-1] < 0.5:\n                low = mid\n            else:\n                high = mid\n        \n        results.append(f\"{(low + high) / 2:.5f}\")  # Store result with 5 decimal places\n    \n    return results\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().strip().split('\\n')\n    \n    test_cases = []\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(data):\n        if data[i].strip() == '':\n            i += 1\n            continue\n        n = int(data[i].strip())\n        nodes = []\n        for j in range(n):\n            i += 1\n            node_info = list(map(int, data[i].strip().split()))\n            nodes.append(node_info)\n        test_cases.append((n, nodes))\n        i += 1\n    \n    results = find_probability(test_cases)\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of careful input/output handling and the need for precise calculations in probability-based problems.",
    "reflection": "In reflecting on the problem-solving experience, several key insights emerged from both my attempts and the official solution provided.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n1. **Node Representation**: The official solution uses a class `node` to represent each node in the circuit, encapsulating the type of node (input, AND, OR) and its connections. This structured approach simplifies the management of node relationships and makes the recursive evaluation of probabilities more intuitive.\n\n2. **Recursive Probability Calculation**: The `finder` function recursively calculates the probability of the output based on the type of node. For input nodes, it returns the probability directly. For OR and AND gates, it combines the probabilities of its inputs using the appropriate logic:\n   - For OR gates: \\( P(A \\text{ OR } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) \\times P(B) \\)\n   - For AND gates: \\( P(A \\text{ AND } B) = P(A) \\times P(B) \\)\n\n3. **Binary Search for Probability**: The solution employs a binary search to find the probability \\( p \\) such that the output probability is exactly 1/2. This is efficient and ensures that the solution converges quickly to the desired precision.\n\n4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The solution is structured to handle multiple test cases in a loop, resetting the node array for each test case. This ensures that the state does not carry over between test cases.\n\n### Reasons for My Approach's Failure:\n- **Input Parsing and Structure**: My approach did not effectively manage the input structure, particularly with blank lines and grouping test cases. The official solution handles input parsing more robustly by directly reading and processing each test case in a loop.\n  \n- **Probability Calculation Logic**: While I attempted to implement the probability calculations, the recursive structure used in the official solution is more elegant and less error-prone. My approach relied on iterative updates, which may have led to incorrect probability evaluations.\n\n- **Output Formatting**: The official solution formats the output correctly using string formatting, ensuring that the results are presented with the required precision. My implementation may have overlooked this detail.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe official solution's use of a class for node representation, recursive probability evaluation, and efficient binary search are effective strategies that I can learn from. In future problems, I will focus on structuring data more effectively and leveraging recursion for complex evaluations, as well as ensuring robust input handling and output formatting.",
