After analyzing the series and identifying the correct pattern, I revised the code to implement the correct formula, which successfully passed all test cases.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_nth_number(N):\n        if N == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            return ((N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1)) // 6\n\n    T = int(input())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        result = find_nth_number(N)\n        print(result)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring the correct mathematical formulas are applied.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The solution involved two main components: determining the largest prime factor for each number and counting the occurrences of these factors.\n\nThe approach I took was to implement a function `largest_prime_factor(n)` that efficiently computes the largest prime factor of a given number by iterating through potential factors up to the square root of the number. This method ensures that we only check necessary divisors, optimizing performance for larger inputs.\n\nThe main function `solve()` handled input reading, processing each test case, and maintaining a frequency count of the largest prime factors using a dictionary. After populating the frequency dictionary, I identified the prime factor with the highest count, ensuring to select the largest one in case of ties.\n\nThe code was structured to read from standard input and output the results directly, which is suitable for competitive programming scenarios. The implementation passed the provided test case successfully, demonstrating that the logic was sound and efficient for the given constraints.\n\nKey takeaways include the importance of optimizing prime factorization and using dictionaries for counting occurrences, which are both common patterns in algorithmic problems involving prime numbers and frequency analysis."

Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes Approach**: \n   - The solution initializes an array `store` where `store[i]` will eventually hold the largest prime factor of `i`. This is done using a modified Sieve of Eratosthenes. \n   - For each prime number `i`, it marks all its multiples with `i`, ensuring that the largest prime factor is recorded for each number.\n\n2. **Counting Frequencies**:\n   - After populating the `store` array, the solution reads the input numbers and uses another array `dp` to count how many times each largest prime factor appears among the input numbers.\n\n3. **Finding the Result**:\n   - The solution then iterates through the input numbers again to determine which prime factor has the highest frequency. In case of ties, it selects the largest prime factor.\n\n4. **Efficiency**:\n   - This approach is efficient because it preprocesses the largest prime factors for all numbers up to 100,000 in a single pass using the sieve method, allowing for quick lookups during the counting phase.\n\n5. **Comparison with My Approach**:\n   - My initial solution involved calculating the largest prime factor for each number individually, which could be less efficient, especially for larger inputs. The sieve method allows for a more efficient preprocessing step, reducing the overall complexity.\n   - The official solution also effectively handles ties by checking both frequency and value, ensuring the correct prime factor is selected.\n\nIn summary, the official solution's use of a sieve to preprocess prime factors significantly optimizes the problem-solving process, making it a valuable technique for similar problems in the future."
