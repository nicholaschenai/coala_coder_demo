INFO - [Task id] 759 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series defined as 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, etc. Initially, I misidentified the formula for generating the series, which led to incorrect outputs. The series is generated by the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares, which can be calculated using the formula:

    \[ T(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2(N-1) + 1)}{6} \]

    This formula derives from the known formula for the sum of the first k squares.

    The initial approach incorrectly used a different formula, resulting in outputs that did not match the expected results. After analyzing the series and identifying the correct pattern, I revised the code to implement the correct formula, which successfully passed all test cases.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def find_nth_number(N):
        if N == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            return ((N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1)) // 6

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        result = find_nth_number(N)
        print(result)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring the correct mathematical formulas are applied.

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 759 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to find the most frequently occurring largest prime factor from a list of integers across multiple test cases. The solution involved two main components: determining the largest prime factor for each number and counting the occurrences of these factors.

The approach I took was to implement a function `largest_prime_factor(n)` that efficiently computes the largest prime factor of a given number by iterating through potential factors up to the square root of the number. This method ensures that we only check necessary divisors, optimizing performance for larger inputs.

The main function `solve()` handled input reading, processing each test case, and maintaining a frequency count of the largest prime factors using a dictionary. After populating the frequency dictionary, I identified the prime factor with the highest count, ensuring to select the largest one in case of ties.

The code was structured to read from standard input and output the results directly, which is suitable for competitive programming scenarios. The implementation passed the provided test case successfully, demonstrating that the logic was sound and efficient for the given constraints.

Key takeaways include the importance of optimizing prime factorization and using dictionaries for counting occurrences, which are both common patterns in algorithmic problems involving prime numbers and frequency analysis.

INFO - [Task id] 759 [generation text] The official solution employs a more efficient approach to determine the largest prime factors for a range of numbers, leveraging a sieve-like method. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes Approach**: 
   - The solution initializes an array `store` where `store[i]` will eventually hold the largest prime factor of `i`. This is done using a modified Sieve of Eratosthenes. 
   - For each prime number `i`, it marks all its multiples with `i`, ensuring that the largest prime factor is recorded for each number.

2. **Counting Frequencies**:
   - After populating the `store` array, the solution reads the input numbers and uses another array `dp` to count how many times each largest prime factor appears among the input numbers.

3. **Finding the Result**:
   - The solution then iterates through the input numbers again to determine which prime factor has the highest frequency. In case of ties, it selects the largest prime factor.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - This approach is efficient because it preprocesses the largest prime factors for all numbers up to 100,000 in a single pass using the sieve method, allowing for quick lookups during the counting phase.

5. **Comparison with My Approach**:
   - My initial solution involved calculating the largest prime factor for each number individually, which could be less efficient, especially for larger inputs. The sieve method allows for a more efficient preprocessing step, reducing the overall complexity.
   - The official solution also effectively handles ties by checking both frequency and value, ensuring the correct prime factor is selected.

In summary, the official solution's use of a sieve to preprocess prime factors significantly optimizes the problem-solving process, making it a valuable technique for similar problems in the future.

[Problem]
    Tara was completing an Algorithms assignment and got stuck on a question. She thought of who can help her, and got reminded of Kabir who has good problem solving skills. The question is:
    Given N$N$ the number of elements in the sequence A1$A_1$,A2$A_2$ â€¦ An$A_n$. Find out the prime factor which occurred maximum number of times among the largest prime factor corresponding to each element. if there are more than one such prime factors print the largest one.
    You are friends with Kabir, help him to solve the problem for Tara.

    -----Input:-----
    - The first line of the input contains a single integer T$T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 
    - First line of each test case contains N$N$, the number of elements in the sequence.
    - Second line contains N space separated elements A1$A_1$,A2$A_2$ â€¦ An$A_n$.

    -----Output:-----
    - For each test case, print a single line, the number which occurs maximum number of times from the largest prime factor corresponding to each element.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1â‰¤Tâ‰¤10$1 \leq T \leq 10$
    - 1â‰¤Nâ‰¤105$1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
    - 2â‰¤A[i]â‰¤105$2 \leq A[i] \leq 10^5$

    -----Sample Input:-----
    1
    7

    3 2 15 6 8 5 10

    -----Sample Output:-----
    5

    -----EXPLANATION:-----
    The largest prime factors of numbers are:
    3 2  5  3  2  5  5 , of which 5 is most frequent.
