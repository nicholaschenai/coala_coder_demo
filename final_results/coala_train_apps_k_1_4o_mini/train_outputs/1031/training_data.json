    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to determine if a right-angled triangle can be formed with a given hypotenuse \\( H \\) and area \\( S \\). The main concepts involved were the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle. The challenge was to derive the lengths of the triangle's sides from these properties and ensure that they met the specified conditions.\n\nThe initial attempts focused on calculating the sides using a discriminant derived from the area and hypotenuse. However, the calculations for the sides \\( a1 \\) and \\( a2 \\) were not yielding valid results, leading to incorrect outputs of -1 for all test cases. The area condition checks were also not robust enough to handle floating-point precision issues.\n\nKey strategies that did not work included relying solely on the discriminant without thoroughly validating the derived side lengths against the area condition. The final solution needed to ensure that both sides were positive and that their product met the area requirement within a specified tolerance.\n\nThe final code structure involved reading input, calculating the discriminant, deriving potential side lengths, and checking the area condition with proper formatting for output. Despite multiple revisions, the code consistently failed to produce the expected results, indicating a deeper issue with the mathematical approach or logic used in the calculations. \n\nIn summary, the experience highlighted the importance of validating mathematical derivations and ensuring that all conditions are checked thoroughly, especially when dealing with floating-point arithmetic.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\nIn my attempts to solve the problem of finding a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \\( H \\) and area \\( S \\), I encountered several challenges that ultimately led to incorrect outputs. The primary issues stemmed from the calculations of the triangle's sides and the area condition checks. My approach involved calculating the discriminant and deriving potential side lengths, but I failed to ensure that these calculations were robust enough to handle all edge cases, particularly with floating-point precision.\n\nThe official solution provided a more streamlined approach. It uses a mathematical formulation that directly computes the base \\( B \\) and height \\( P \\) of the triangle based on the hypotenuse \\( H \\) and area \\( S \\). The key steps in the official solution are:\n\n1. **Discriminant Check**: It first checks if the expression \\( (H^4 - 16S^2) \\) is negative, which indicates that no valid triangle can be formed.\n2. **Calculating Sides**: It calculates the base \\( B \\) and height \\( P \\) using derived formulas that ensure both sides are valid and satisfy the area condition.\n3. **Output Formatting**: The solution formats the output to six decimal places and ensures the sides are printed in non-decreasing order.\n\nThe official solution's use of direct mathematical relationships simplifies the problem significantly compared to my approach, which involved more complex calculations and checks. This experience highlights the importance of leveraging mathematical properties and relationships in geometry problems to derive solutions more efficiently. \n\nIn future attempts, I will focus on ensuring that my calculations are not only correct but also efficient and straightforward, particularly in problems involving geometric properties.",
