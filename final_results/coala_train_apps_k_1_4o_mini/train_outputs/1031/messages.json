Chefu says that he has understood everything about right angled triangles. Chef wants to check learning of his brother by asking the following question \"Can you find a right angled triangle whose length of hypotenuse  is H and its area is S?\"\nChefu is confused how to solve it. I hope you are not. Please solve this by finding a right angled triangle with hypotenuse H and area S. If it not possible to do so, then output -1.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test-cases. T test cases follow.\nFor each test case, there will be a single line containing two space separated integers H and S.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput the answer for each test-case in a single line. If it is not possible to find such a triangle, output -1. Otherwise print 3 real numbers corresponding to the lengths of the sides of the triangle sorted in non-decreasing order. Please note that the length of the triangle sides should not differ by more than 0.01 in absolute value from the correct lengths.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 105\n- 1 \u2264 H \u2264 106\n- 1 \u2264 S \u2264 1012\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:4\n5 6\n6 10\n258303 89837245228\n616153 77878145466\nOutput:3.00000 4.00000 5.00000\n-1\n-1\n285168.817674 546189.769984 616153.000000\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is \\(N \\times (N - 1) / 2\\).\n\n    #### Key Concepts:\n    1. **Maximum and Minimum Values of f(P):** The maximum value occurs with a descending permutation, while the minimum is 0 (for N = 1).\n    2. **Adjustment of Permutation:** The challenge was to adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K by swapping elements to reduce the contribution of adjacent maximums.\n\n    #### Strategies and Issues:\n    - The initial approach involved starting with a descending permutation and attempting to reduce f(P) by swapping adjacent elements. However, this logic was flawed as it did not effectively account for how adjacent maximums changed with swaps.\n    - The code consistently returned `-1` for valid cases, indicating a failure to construct the desired permutation.\n\n    #### Lessons Learned:\n    - A more systematic approach is needed to generate permutations that can achieve specific values of K. The adjustment logic must be refined to ensure that all possible values of f(P) can be reached.\n    - Future implementations should focus on a clearer strategy for adjusting the permutation based on the difference between the current f(P) and the target K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n    The following code snippet represents the last attempt, which ultimately failed to pass the test cases:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n        results = []  # To store results for each test case\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum possible f(P)\n        \n            if K > max_f or K < 0:  # Check if K is out of bounds\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                # Start with the descending permutation\n                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                current_f = max_f  # Start with the maximum f(P)\n            \n                # Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K\n                for i in range(N - 1):\n                    if current_f == K:\n                        break\n                    # If we can reduce the current_f by 1, we swap elements\n                    if current_f > K:\n                        # Swap the last two elements to reduce the f(P) value\n                        permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                        current_f -= 1  # Decrease the f(P) value by 1\n            \n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))  # Store the result as a string\n\n        # Print all results at once for efficiency\n        print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n    ```\n\n    This summary encapsulates the core concepts, strategies attempted, and the lessons learned from the problem-solving process.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

My approach involved calculating the discriminant and deriving potential side lengths, but I failed to ensure that these calculations were robust enough to handle all edge cases, particularly with floating-point precision.\n\nThe official solution provided a more streamlined approach. It uses a mathematical formulation that directly computes the base \\( B \\) and height \\( P \\) of the triangle based on the hypotenuse \\( H \\) and area \\( S \\). The key steps in the official solution are:\n\n1. **Discriminant Check**: It first checks if the expression \\( (H^4 - 16S^2) \\) is negative, which indicates that no valid triangle can be formed.\n2. **Calculating Sides**: It calculates the base \\( B \\) and height \\( P \\) using derived formulas that ensure both sides are valid and satisfy the area condition.\n3. **Output Formatting**: The solution formats the output to six decimal places and ensures the sides are printed in non-decreasing order.\n\nThe official solution's use of direct mathematical relationships simplifies the problem significantly compared to my approach, which involved more complex calculations and checks. This experience highlights the importance of leveraging mathematical properties and relationships in geometry problems to derive solutions more efficiently. \n\nIn future attempts, I will focus on ensuring that my calculations are not only correct but also efficient and straightforward, particularly in problems involving geometric properties."
