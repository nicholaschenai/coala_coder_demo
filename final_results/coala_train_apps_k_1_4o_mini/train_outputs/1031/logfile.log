## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef taught his brother Chefu about right angled triangle and its properties. Chefu says that he has understood everything about right angled triangles. Chef wants to check learning of his brother by asking the following question "Can you find a right angled triangle whose length of hypotenuse  is H and its area is S?"
Chefu is confused how to solve it. I hope you are not. Please solve this by finding a right angled triangle with hypotenuse H and area S. If it not possible to do so, then output -1.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test-cases. T test cases follow.
For each test case, there will be a single line containing two space separated integers H and S.

-----Output-----
Output the answer for each test-case in a single line. If it is not possible to find such a triangle, output -1. Otherwise print 3 real numbers corresponding to the lengths of the sides of the triangle sorted in non-decreasing order. Please note that the length of the triangle sides should not differ by more than 0.01 in absolute value from the correct lengths.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to determine if there exists a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we should return the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible to form such a triangle, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   A right-angled triangle has a hypotenuse \( H \) and two other sides \( a \) and \( b \). The area \( S \) of the triangle can be expressed as \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \). From the Pythagorean theorem, we know that \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \). We can derive \( b \) in terms of \( a \) and \( H \) and substitute it into the area formula to find a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \). We can then solve this quadratic equation to find possible values for \( a \) and subsequently \( b \). If valid values are found, we will sort and return them; otherwise, we will return -1.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_triangle(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           H, S = test_case
           if S * 2 > H * H:
               output -1
               continue
           a = sqrt((H * H) / 2 + sqrt((H * H) * (H * H) / 4 - S * S))
           b = (2 * S) / a
           if a > b:
               swap a and b
           if a^2 + b^2 == H^2:
               output a, b, H

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing elements based on their indices. The key insight was recognizing that the maximum reduction possible is the sum of the first N natural numbers, which can be calculated using the formula \(N \times (N + 1) / 2\).

    Initially, the solution incorrectly handled the conditions for determining if the sequence could be made "good." The logic needed to explicitly check if the total sum was zero, if it was positive and could be reduced to zero, or if it was negative, which would immediately result in "NO." 

    The final working solution iterates through each test case, calculates the total sum and maximum reduction, and checks the conditions correctly. The code snippet that encapsulates the solution is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            A = case[1]
            total_sum = sum(A)
            max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2
        
            if total_sum == 0:
                print("YES")
            elif total_sum > 0 and total_sum <= max_reduction:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all possible conditions and edge cases when solving problems involving sums and modifications of sequences.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to determine if a right-angled triangle can be formed with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and a specific area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we need to output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible to form such a triangle, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To find the sides of a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \), we can use the properties of right triangles. The area \( S \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b
   \]
   where \( a \) and \( b \) are the two legs of the triangle. Additionally, by the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 = H^2
   \]
   We can derive \( b \) in terms of \( a \) and substitute it into the area equation to find a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \). We can then solve this quadratic equation to find possible values for \( a \) and \( b \). If valid solutions exist, we will sort and output them; otherwise, we will return -1.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef taught his brother Chefu about right angled triangle and its properties. Chefu says that he has understood everything about right angled triangles. Chef wants to check learning of his brother by asking the following question "Can you find a right angled triangle whose length of hypotenuse  is H and its area is S?"
Chefu is confused how to solve it. I hope you are not. Please solve this by finding a right angled triangle with hypotenuse H and area S. If it not possible to do so, then output -1.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test-cases. T test cases follow.
For each test case, there will be a single line containing two space separated integers H and S.

-----Output-----
Output the answer for each test-case in a single line. If it is not possible to find such a triangle, output -1. Otherwise print 3 real numbers corresponding to the lengths of the sides of the triangle sorted in non-decreasing order. Please note that the length of the triangle sides should not differ by more than 0.01 in absolute value from the correct lengths.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to determine if a right-angled triangle can be formed with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and a specific area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we need to output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible to form such a triangle, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To find the sides of a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \), we can use the properties of right triangles. The area \( S \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b
   \]
   where \( a \) and \( b \) are the two legs of the triangle. Additionally, by the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 = H^2
   \]
   We can derive \( b \) in terms of \( a \) and substitute it into the area equation to find a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \). We can then solve this quadratic equation to find possible values for \( a \) and \( b \). If valid solutions exist, we will sort and output them; otherwise, we will return -1.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_triangle(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           H = test_case[0]

           # Check if the area matches S
           if (a1 * b1 / 2 == S) and (a1 > 0 and b1 > 0):

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   The goal is to find the sides of a right-angled triangle given the hypotenuse \( H \) and the area \( S \). If such a triangle cannot be formed, we should return -1.

2. **Identifying the Mistakes**:
   - **Input/Output Handling**: The previous code does not handle input and output correctly. It is designed as a function but does not read from standard input or print the results in the expected format.
   - **Area Calculation**: The area calculation checks if \( a1 \times b1 / 2 == S \) and \( a2 \times b2 / 2 == S \) may not be sufficient due to floating-point precision issues. We should allow for a small tolerance when comparing floating-point numbers.
   - **Sorting Output**: The output should be formatted correctly and sorted in non-decreasing order before printing.

3. **Step-by-Step Correction**:
   - We need to read the input directly from standard input.
   - We should ensure that the output is formatted correctly and sorted.
   - We should implement a tolerance check for floating-point comparisons.

4. **Revised Code**:
   The following code will address the above issues by correctly handling input/output and ensuring proper calculations and formatting.

```python
def find_triangle(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        H = case[0]
        S = case[1]
        
        # Calculate the discriminant for the quadratic equation
        D = H**4 - 32 * S**2
        if D < 0:
            print(-1)

        # Calculate the two possible values for a
        a1 = ((H**2 + D**0.5) / 2)**0.5
        a2 = ((H**2 - D**0.5) / 2)**0.5
        
        # Calculate corresponding b values
        b1 = (H**2 - a1**2)**0.5
        b2 = (H**2 - a2**2)**0.5
        
        # Check if the area matches S with a tolerance for floating-point comparison
        tolerance = 0.01
        valid = False
        
        if (abs(a1 * b1 / 2 - S) < tolerance) and (a1 > 0 and b1 > 0):
            valid = True
            sides = sorted([a1, b1, H])
        elif (abs(a2 * b2 / 2 - S) < tolerance) and (a2 > 0 and b2 > 0):
            valid = True
            sides = sorted([a2, b2, H])
        
        if valid:
            print(f"{sides[0]:.5f} {sides[1]:.5f} {sides[2]:.5f}")
        else:
            print(-1)

# Read input from standard input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().splitlines()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in data[1:T + 1]]

find_triangle(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Changes:
- **Input Handling**: The code now reads all input at once and processes it.
- **Output Formatting**: The output is formatted to five decimal places and sorted correctly.
- **Floating-Point Comparison**: A tolerance is used to check if the calculated area is close enough to \( S \). 

This should resolve the issues and allow the code to pass all tests.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to determine if a right-angled triangle can be formed with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and a specific area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we need to output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible to form such a triangle, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To find the sides of a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \), we can use the properties of right triangles. The area \( S \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b
   \]
   where \( a \) and \( b \) are the two legs of the triangle. Additionally, by the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 = H^2
   \]
   We can derive \( b \) in terms of \( a \) and substitute it into the area equation to find a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \). We can then solve this quadratic equation to find possible values for \( a \) and \( b \). If valid solutions exist, we will sort and output them; otherwise, we will return -1.

### Key Changes:
- **Input Handling**: The code now reads all input at once and processes it.
- **Output Formatting**: The output is formatted to five decimal places and sorted correctly.
- **Floating-Point Comparison**: A tolerance is used to check if the calculated area is close enough to \( S \). 

This should resolve the issues and allow the code to pass all tests.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series defined as 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, etc. Initially, I misidentified the formula for generating the series, which led to incorrect outputs. The series is generated by the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares, which can be calculated using the formula:

    \[ T(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2(N-1) + 1)}{6} \]

    This formula derives from the known formula for the sum of the first k squares.

    The initial approach incorrectly used a different formula, resulting in outputs that did not match the expected results. After analyzing the series and identifying the correct pattern, I revised the code to implement the correct formula, which successfully passed all test cases.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def find_nth_number(N):
        if N == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            return ((N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1)) // 6

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        result = find_nth_number(N)
        print(result)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring the correct mathematical formulas are applied.

- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef taught his brother Chefu about right angled triangle and its properties. Chefu says that he has understood everything about right angled triangles. Chef wants to check learning of his brother by asking the following question "Can you find a right angled triangle whose length of hypotenuse  is H and its area is S?"
Chefu is confused how to solve it. I hope you are not. Please solve this by finding a right angled triangle with hypotenuse H and area S. If it not possible to do so, then output -1.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test-cases. T test cases follow.
For each test case, there will be a single line containing two space separated integers H and S.

-----Output-----
Output the answer for each test-case in a single line. If it is not possible to find such a triangle, output -1. Otherwise print 3 real numbers corresponding to the lengths of the sides of the triangle sorted in non-decreasing order. Please note that the length of the triangle sides should not differ by more than 0.01 in absolute value from the correct lengths.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to determine if a right-angled triangle can be formed with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and a specific area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we need to output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible to form such a triangle, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To find the sides of a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \), we can use the properties of right triangles. The area \( S \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b
   \]
   where \( a \) and \( b \) are the two legs of the triangle. Additionally, by the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 = H^2
   \]
   We can derive \( b \) in terms of \( a \) and substitute it into the area equation to find a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \). We can then solve this quadratic equation to find possible values for \( a \) and \( b \). If valid solutions exist, we will sort and output them; otherwise, we will return -1.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   The goal is to find the sides of a right-angled triangle given the hypotenuse \( H \) and the area \( S \). If such a triangle cannot be formed, we should return -1.

2. **Identifying the Mistakes**:
   - **Input/Output Handling**: The previous code does not handle input and output correctly. It is designed as a function but does not read from standard input or print the results in the expected format.
   - **Area Calculation**: The area calculation checks if \( a1 \times b1 / 2 == S \) and \( a2 \times b2 / 2 == S \) may not be sufficient due to floating-point precision issues. We should allow for a small tolerance when comparing floating-point numbers.
   - **Sorting Output**: The output should be formatted correctly and sorted in non-decreasing order before printing.

3. **Step-by-Step Correction**:
   - We need to read the input directly from standard input.
   - We should ensure that the output is formatted correctly and sorted.
   - We should implement a tolerance check for floating-point comparisons.

4. **Revised Code**:
   The following code will address the above issues by correctly handling input/output and ensuring proper calculations and formatting.

```python

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   We need to find the sides of a right-angled triangle given the hypotenuse \( H \) and the area \( S \). If such a triangle cannot be formed, we should return -1.

2. **Identifying the Mistakes**:
   - **Discriminant Calculation**: The discriminant \( D = H^4 - 32S^2 \) is used to determine if valid triangle sides can be found. If \( D < 0 \), it indicates that no real solutions exist. However, we need to ensure that the calculations for \( a1 \) and \( a2 \) are correct.
   - **Area Calculation**: The area check might be failing due to the way we are calculating \( a1 \) and \( b1 \). We need to ensure that the values derived from the quadratic equation are valid and that they satisfy the area condition.
   - **Floating-Point Precision**: The tolerance check for floating-point comparisons may not be sufficient if the calculations for \( a1 \) and \( b1 \) are incorrect.

3. **Step-by-Step Correction**:
   - We need to ensure that the calculations for \( a1 \) and \( a2 \) are derived correctly from the quadratic equation.
   - We should also ensure that the area condition is checked correctly after calculating the sides.

4. **Revised Code**:
   The following code will address the above issues by ensuring correct calculations and checks.

```python
def find_triangle(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        H = case[0]
        S = case[1]

        b1 = (H**2 - a1**2)**0.5
        b2 = (H**2 - a2**2)**0.5
        
        # Check if the area matches S with a tolerance for floating-point comparison
        tolerance = 0.01
        valid = False
        
        if (a1 > 0 and b1 > 0) and (abs(a1 * b1 / 2 - S) < tolerance):
            valid = True
            sides = sorted([a1, b1, H])

data = input().splitlines()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in data[1:T + 1]]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to determine if a right-angled triangle can be formed with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and a specific area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we need to output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible to form such a triangle, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To find the sides of a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \), we can use the properties of right triangles. The area \( S \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b
   \]
   where \( a \) and \( b \) are the two legs of the triangle. Additionally, by the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 = H^2
   \]
   We can derive \( b \) in terms of \( a \) and substitute it into the area equation to find a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \). We can then solve this quadratic equation to find possible values for \( a \) and \( b \). If valid solutions exist, we will sort and output them; otherwise, we will return -1.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_triangle(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           H = test_case[0]

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   We need to find the sides of a right-angled triangle given the hypotenuse \( H \) and the area \( S \). If such a triangle cannot be formed, we should return -1.

2. **Identifying the Mistakes**:
   - **Discriminant Calculation**: The discriminant \( D = H^4 - 32S^2 \) is used to determine if valid triangle sides can be found. If \( D < 0 \), it indicates that no real solutions exist. However, we need to ensure that the calculations for \( a1 \) and \( a2 \) are correct.
   - **Area Calculation**: The area check might be failing due to the way we are calculating \( a1 \) and \( b1 \). We need to ensure that the values derived from the quadratic equation are valid and that they satisfy the area condition.
   - **Floating-Point Precision**: The tolerance check for floating-point comparisons may not be sufficient if the calculations for \( a1 \) and \( b1 \) are incorrect.

3. **Step-by-Step Correction**:
   - We need to ensure that the calculations for \( a1 \) and \( a2 \) are derived correctly from the quadratic equation.
   - We should also ensure that the area condition is checked correctly after calculating the sides.

4. **Revised Code**:
   The following code will address the above issues by ensuring correct calculations and checks.

```python
def find_triangle(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        H = case[0]
        S = case[1]
        
        # Calculate the discriminant for the quadratic equation
        D = H**4 - 32 * S**2
        if D < 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the two possible values for a
        a1 = ((H**2 + D**0.5) / 2)**0.5
        a2 = ((H**2 - D**0.5) / 2)**0.5
        
        # Calculate corresponding b values
        b1 = (H**2 - a1**2)**0.5
        b2 = (H**2 - a2**2)**0.5
        
        # Check if the area matches S with a tolerance for floating-point comparison
        tolerance = 0.01
        valid = False
        
        if (a1 > 0 and b1 > 0) and (abs(a1 * b1 / 2 - S) < tolerance):
            valid = True
            sides = sorted([a1, b1, H])
        elif (a2 > 0 and b2 > 0) and (abs(a2 * b2 / 2 - S) < tolerance):
            valid = True
            sides = sorted([a2, b2, H])
        
        if valid:
            print(f"{sides[0]:.5f} {sides[1]:.5f} {sides[2]:.5f}")
        else:
            print(-1)

# Read input from standard input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().splitlines()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in data[1:T + 1]]

find_triangle(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Features of the Code:
- **Input Handling**: The code reads all input at once and processes it.
- **Correct Area Calculation**: The area condition is checked after ensuring that both \( a \) and \( b \) are positive.
- **Output Formatting**: The output is formatted to five decimal places and sorted correctly.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series defined as 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, etc. Initially, I misidentified the formula for generating the series, which led to incorrect outputs. The series is generated by the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares, which can be calculated using the formula:

    \[ T(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2(N-1) + 1)}{6} \]

    This formula derives from the known formula for the sum of the first k squares.

    The initial approach incorrectly used a different formula, resulting in outputs that did not match the expected results. After analyzing the series and identifying the correct pattern, I revised the code to implement the correct formula, which successfully passed all test cases.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def find_nth_number(N):
        if N == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            return ((N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1)) // 6

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        result = find_nth_number(N)
        print(result)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring the correct mathematical formulas are applied.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef taught his brother Chefu about right angled triangle and its properties. Chefu says that he has understood everything about right angled triangles. Chef wants to check learning of his brother by asking the following question "Can you find a right angled triangle whose length of hypotenuse  is H and its area is S?"
Chefu is confused how to solve it. I hope you are not. Please solve this by finding a right angled triangle with hypotenuse H and area S. If it not possible to do so, then output -1.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test-cases. T test cases follow.
For each test case, there will be a single line containing two space separated integers H and S.

-----Output-----
Output the answer for each test-case in a single line. If it is not possible to find such a triangle, output -1. Otherwise print 3 real numbers corresponding to the lengths of the sides of the triangle sorted in non-decreasing order. Please note that the length of the triangle sides should not differ by more than 0.01 in absolute value from the correct lengths.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to determine if a right-angled triangle can be formed with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and a specific area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we need to output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible to form such a triangle, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To find the sides of a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \), we can use the properties of right triangles. The area \( S \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b
   \]
   where \( a \) and \( b \) are the two legs of the triangle. Additionally, by the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 = H^2
   \]
   We can derive \( b \) in terms of \( a \) and substitute it into the area equation to find a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \). We can then solve this quadratic equation to find possible values for \( a \) and \( b \). If valid solutions exist, we will sort and output them; otherwise, we will return -1.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   The goal is to find the sides of a right-angled triangle given the hypotenuse \( H \) and the area \( S \). If such a triangle cannot be formed, we should return -1.

2. **Identifying the Mistakes**:
   - **Input/Output Handling**: The previous code does not handle input and output correctly. It is designed as a function but does not read from standard input or print the results in the expected format.
   - **Area Calculation**: The area calculation checks if \( a1 \times b1 / 2 == S \) and \( a2 \times b2 / 2 == S \) may not be sufficient due to floating-point precision issues. We should allow for a small tolerance when comparing floating-point numbers.
   - **Sorting Output**: The output should be formatted correctly and sorted in non-decreasing order before printing.

3. **Step-by-Step Correction**:
   - We need to read the input directly from standard input.
   - We should ensure that the output is formatted correctly and sorted.
   - We should implement a tolerance check for floating-point comparisons.

4. **Revised Code**:
   The following code will address the above issues by correctly handling input/output and ensuring proper calculations and formatting.

```python
def find_triangle(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        H = case[0]
        S = case[1]
        
        # Calculate the discriminant for the quadratic equation
        D = H**4 - 32 * S**2
        if D < 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the two possible values for a
        a1 = ((H**2 + D**0.5) / 2)**0.5
        a2 = ((H**2 - D**0.5) / 2)**0.5
        
        # Calculate corresponding b values
        b1 = (H**2 - a1**2)**0.5
        b2 = (H**2 - a2**2)**0.5
        
        # Check if the area matches S with a tolerance for floating-point comparison
        tolerance = 0.01
        valid = False
        
        if (abs(a1 * b1 / 2 - S) < tolerance) and (a1 > 0 and b1 > 0):
            valid = True
            sides = sorted([a1, b1, H])
        elif (abs(a2 * b2 / 2 - S) < tolerance) and (a2 > 0 and b2 > 0):
            valid = True
            sides = sorted([a2, b2, H])
        
        if valid:
            print(f"{sides[0]:.5f} {sides[1]:.5f} {sides[2]:.5f}")
        else:
            print(-1)

# Read input from standard input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().splitlines()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in data[1:T + 1]]

find_triangle(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Changes:
- **Input Handling**: The code now reads all input at once and processes it.
- **Output Formatting**: The output is formatted to five decimal places and sorted correctly.
- **Floating-Point Comparison**: A tolerance is used to check if the calculated area is close enough to \( S \). 

This should resolve the issues and allow the code to pass all tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to determine if a right-angled triangle can be formed with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and a specific area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we need to output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible to form such a triangle, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To find the sides of a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \), we can use the properties of right triangles. The area \( S \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b
   \]
   where \( a \) and \( b \) are the two legs of the triangle. Additionally, by the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 = H^2
   \]
   We can derive \( b \) in terms of \( a \) and substitute it into the area equation to find a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \). We can then solve this quadratic equation to find possible values for \( a \) and \( b \). If valid solutions exist, we will sort and output them; otherwise, we will return -1.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_triangle(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           H = test_case[0]

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   The goal is to find the sides of a right-angled triangle given the hypotenuse \( H \) and the area \( S \). If such a triangle cannot be formed, we should return -1.

2. **Identifying the Mistakes**:
   - **Input/Output Handling**: The previous code does not handle input and output correctly. It is designed as a function but does not read from standard input or print the results in the expected format.
   - **Area Calculation**: The area calculation checks if \( a1 \times b1 / 2 == S \) and \( a2 \times b2 / 2 == S \) may not be sufficient due to floating-point precision issues. We should allow for a small tolerance when comparing floating-point numbers.
   - **Sorting Output**: The output should be formatted correctly and sorted in non-decreasing order before printing.

3. **Step-by-Step Correction**:
   - We need to read the input directly from standard input.
   - We should ensure that the output is formatted correctly and sorted.
   - We should implement a tolerance check for floating-point comparisons.

4. **Revised Code**:
   The following code will address the above issues by correctly handling input/output and ensuring proper calculations and formatting.

```python
def find_triangle(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        H = case[0]
        S = case[1]
        
        # Calculate the discriminant for the quadratic equation
        D = H**4 - 32 * S**2
        if D < 0:

        # Calculate corresponding b values
        b1 = (H**2 - a1**2)**0.5
        b2 = (H**2 - a2**2)**0.5
        
        # Check if the area matches S with a tolerance for floating-point comparison
        tolerance = 0.01
        valid = False
        
        if (abs(a1 * b1 / 2 - S) < tolerance) and (a1 > 0 and b1 > 0):
            valid = True
            sides = sorted([a1, b1, H])
        elif (abs(a2 * b2 / 2 - S) < tolerance) and (a2 > 0 and b2 > 0):
            valid = True
            sides = sorted([a2, b2, H])
        
        if valid:
            print(f"{sides[0]:.5f} {sides[1]:.5f} {sides[2]:.5f}")
        else:

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in data[1:T + 1]]

### Key Changes:
- **Input Handling**: The code now reads all input at once and processes it.
- **Output Formatting**: The output is formatted to five decimal places and sorted correctly.
- **Floating-Point Comparison**: A tolerance is used to check if the calculated area is close enough to \( S \).

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts

    The problem involved finding a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function, f(P), equals a given integer K. The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is \(N \times (N - 1) / 2\).

    #### Key Concepts:
    1. **Maximum and Minimum Values of f(P):** The maximum value occurs with a descending permutation, while the minimum is 0 (for N = 1).
    2. **Adjustment of Permutation:** The challenge was to adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K by swapping elements to reduce the contribution of adjacent maximums.

    #### Strategies and Issues:
    - The initial approach involved starting with a descending permutation and attempting to reduce f(P) by swapping adjacent elements. However, this logic was flawed as it did not effectively account for how adjacent maximums changed with swaps.
    - The code consistently returned `-1` for valid cases, indicating a failure to construct the desired permutation.

    #### Lessons Learned:
    - A more systematic approach is needed to generate permutations that can achieve specific values of K. The adjustment logic must be refined to ensure that all possible values of f(P) can be reached.
    - Future implementations should focus on a clearer strategy for adjusting the permutation based on the difference between the current f(P) and the target K.

    ### Code Snippet
    The following code snippet represents the last attempt, which ultimately failed to pass the test cases:

    ```python
    def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
        results = []  # To store results for each test case
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case
            max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum possible f(P)
        
            if K > max_f or K < 0:  # Check if K is out of bounds
                results.append("-1")
            else:
                # Start with the descending permutation

[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] Based on the previous analysis and the insights gained, here is the corrected Python code for the problem of finding a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \). The code has been revised to ensure that the calculations are accurate and that the output is formatted correctly.

### Key Corrections:
1. **Correct Calculation of Sides**: The calculations for the sides of the triangle must ensure that they satisfy both the Pythagorean theorem and the area condition.
2. **Output Formatting**: The output must be formatted to five decimal places and sorted correctly.
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: Ensure that the area condition is checked correctly after calculating the sides.

Here is the revised code:

```python
def find_triangle(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        H = case[0]
        S = case[1]
        
        # Calculate the discriminant for the quadratic equation
        D = H**4 - 32 * S**2
        if D < 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the two possible values for a
        a1 = ((H**2 + D**0.5) / 2)**0.5
        a2 = ((H**2 - D**0.5) / 2)**0.5
        
        # Calculate corresponding b values
        b1 = (H**2 - a1**2)**0.5
        b2 = (H**2 - a2**2)**0.5
        
        # Check if the area matches S with a tolerance for floating-point comparison
        tolerance = 0.01
        valid = False
        
        if (a1 > 0 and b1 > 0) and (abs(a1 * b1 / 2 - S) < tolerance):
            valid = True
            sides = sorted([a1, b1, H])
        elif (a2 > 0 and b2 > 0) and (abs(a2 * b2 / 2 - S) < tolerance):
            valid = True
            sides = sorted([a2, b2, H])
        
        if valid:
            print(f"{sides[0]:.5f} {sides[1]:.5f} {sides[2]:.5f}")
        else:
            print(-1)

data = input().splitlines()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in data[1:T + 1]]

find_triangle(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Input Handling**: The code reads all input at once and processes it.
- **Discriminant Calculation**: It calculates the discriminant to check if valid triangle sides can be found.
- **Side Calculations**: It calculates the possible values for the sides \( a \) and \( b \) based on the hypotenuse \( H \) and checks if they satisfy the area condition.
- **Output Formatting**: The output is formatted to five decimal places and sorted correctly.

This code should now work correctly for the given problem and pass all test cases.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef taught his brother Chefu about right angled triangle and its properties. Chefu says that he has understood everything about right angled triangles. Chef wants to check learning of his brother by asking the following question "Can you find a right angled triangle whose length of hypotenuse  is H and its area is S?"
Chefu is confused how to solve it. I hope you are not. Please solve this by finding a right angled triangle with hypotenuse H and area S. If it not possible to do so, then output -1.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test-cases. T test cases follow.
For each test case, there will be a single line containing two space separated integers H and S.

-----Output-----
Output the answer for each test-case in a single line. If it is not possible to find such a triangle, output -1. Otherwise print 3 real numbers corresponding to the lengths of the sides of the triangle sorted in non-decreasing order. Please note that the length of the triangle sides should not differ by more than 0.01 in absolute value from the correct lengths.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to determine if a right-angled triangle can be formed with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and a specific area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we need to output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible to form such a triangle, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To find the sides of a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \), we can use the properties of right triangles. The area \( S \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b
   \]
   where \( a \) and \( b \) are the two legs of the triangle. Additionally, by the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 = H^2
   \]
   We can derive \( b \) in terms of \( a \) and substitute it into the area equation to find a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \). We can then solve this quadratic equation to find possible values for \( a \) and \( b \). If valid solutions exist, we will sort and output them; otherwise, we will return -1.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_triangle(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           H = test_case[0]

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   The goal is to find the sides of a right-angled triangle given the hypotenuse \( H \) and the area \( S \). If such a triangle cannot be formed, we should return -1.

2. **Identifying the Mistakes**:
   - **Input/Output Handling**: The previous code does not handle input and output correctly. It is designed as a function but does not read from standard input or print the results in the expected format.
   - **Area Calculation**: The area calculation checks if \( a1 \times b1 / 2 == S \) and \( a2 \times b2 / 2 == S \) may not be sufficient due to floating-point precision issues. We should allow for a small tolerance when comparing floating-point numbers.
   - **Sorting Output**: The output should be formatted correctly and sorted in non-decreasing order before printing.

3. **Step-by-Step Correction**:
   - We need to read the input directly from standard input.
   - We should ensure that the output is formatted correctly and sorted.
   - We should implement a tolerance check for floating-point comparisons.

4. **Revised Code**:
   The following code will address the above issues by correctly handling input/output and ensuring proper calculations and formatting.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   We need to find the sides of a right-angled triangle given the hypotenuse \( H \) and the area \( S \). If such a triangle cannot be formed, we should return -1.

2. **Identifying the Mistakes**:
   - **Discriminant Calculation**: The discriminant \( D = H^4 - 32S^2 \) is used to determine if valid triangle sides can be found. If \( D < 0 \), it indicates that no real solutions exist. However, we need to ensure that the calculations for \( a1 \) and \( a2 \) are correct.
   - **Area Calculation**: The area check might be failing due to the way we are calculating \( a1 \) and \( b1 \). We need to ensure that the values derived from the quadratic equation are valid and that they satisfy the area condition.
   - **Floating-Point Precision**: The tolerance check for floating-point comparisons may not be sufficient if the calculations for \( a1 \) and \( b1 \) are incorrect.

3. **Step-by-Step Correction**:
   - We need to ensure that the calculations for \( a1 \) and \( a2 \) are derived correctly from the quadratic equation.
   - We should also ensure that the area condition is checked correctly after calculating the sides.

    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine if a right-angled triangle can be formed with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \). The main concepts involved were the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle. The challenge was to derive the lengths of the triangle's sides from these properties and ensure that they met the specified conditions.

The initial attempts focused on calculating the sides using a discriminant derived from the area and hypotenuse. However, the calculations for the sides \( a1 \) and \( a2 \) were not yielding valid results, leading to incorrect outputs of -1 for all test cases. The area condition checks were also not robust enough to handle floating-point precision issues.

Key strategies that did not work included relying solely on the discriminant without thoroughly validating the derived side lengths against the area condition. The final solution needed to ensure that both sides were positive and that their product met the area requirement within a specified tolerance.

The final code structure involved reading input, calculating the discriminant, deriving potential side lengths, and checking the area condition with proper formatting for output. Despite multiple revisions, the code consistently failed to produce the expected results, indicating a deeper issue with the mathematical approach or logic used in the calculations. 

In summary, the experience highlighted the importance of validating mathematical derivations and ensuring that all conditions are checked thoroughly, especially when dealing with floating-point arithmetic.

If such a triangle exists, we need to output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible to form such a triangle, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To find the sides of a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \), we can use the properties of right triangles. The area \( S \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b
   \]
   where \( a \) and \( b \) are the two legs of the triangle. Additionally, by the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 = H^2
   \]
   We can derive \( b \) in terms of \( a \) and substitute it into the area equation to find a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \). We can then solve this quadratic equation to find possible values for \( a \) and \( b \). If valid solutions exist, we will sort and output them; otherwise, we will return -1.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_triangle(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           H = test_case[0]
           S = test_case[1]
           
           # Calculate the discriminant for the quadratic equation
           D = H^4 - 32 * S^2
           if D < 0:
               print -1
               continue
           
           # Calculate the two possible values for a
           a1 = sqrt((H^2 + sqrt(D)) / 2)
           a2 = sqrt((H^2 - sqrt(D)) / 2)
           
           # Calculate corresponding b values
           b1 = sqrt(H^2 - a1^2)
           b2 = sqrt(H^2 - a2^2)
           
           # Check if the area matches S
           if (a1 * b1 / 2 == S) and (a1 > 0 and b1 > 0):
               print sorted([a1, b1, H])
           elif (a2 * b2 / 2 == S) and (a2 > 0 and b2 > 0):
               print sorted([a2, b2, H])

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   The goal is to find the sides of a right-angled triangle given the hypotenuse \( H \) and the area \( S \). If such a triangle cannot be formed, we should return -1.

2. **Identifying the Mistakes**:
   - **Input/Output Handling**: The previous code does not handle input and output correctly. It is designed as a function but does not read from standard input or print the results in the expected format.
   - **Area Calculation**: The area calculation checks if \( a1 \times b1 / 2 == S \) and \( a2 \times b2 / 2 == S \) may not be sufficient due to floating-point precision issues. We should allow for a small tolerance when comparing floating-point numbers.
   - **Sorting Output**: The output should be formatted correctly and sorted in non-decreasing order before printing.

3. **Step-by-Step Correction**:
   - We need to read the input directly from standard input.
   - We should ensure that the output is formatted correctly and sorted.
   - We should implement a tolerance check for floating-point comparisons.

4. **Revised Code**:
   The following code will address the above issues by correctly handling input/output and ensuring proper calculations and formatting.

```python
def find_triangle(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        H = case[0]
        S = case[1]
        
        # Calculate the discriminant for the quadratic equation
        D = H**4 - 32 * S**2
        if D < 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the two possible values for a

        a2 = ((H**2 - D**0.5) / 2)**0.5
        
        # Calculate corresponding b values
        b1 = (H**2 - a1**2)**0.5
        b2 = (H**2 - a2**2)**0.5
        
        # Check if the area matches S with a tolerance for floating-point comparison
        tolerance = 0.01
        valid = False
        
        if (abs(a1 * b1 / 2 - S) < tolerance) and (a1 > 0 and b1 > 0):
            valid = True
            sides = sorted([a1, b1, H])
        elif (abs(a2 * b2 / 2 - S) < tolerance) and (a2 > 0 and b2 > 0):
            valid = True
            sides = sorted([a2, b2, H])
        
        if valid:
            print(f"{sides[0]:.5f} {sides[1]:.5f} {sides[2]:.5f}")
        else:
            print(-1)

data = input().splitlines()

T = int(data[0])
test_cases = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in data[1:T + 1]]

find_triangle(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Changes:
- **Input Handling**: The code now reads all input at once and processes it.
- **Output Formatting**: The output is formatted to five decimal places and sorted correctly.
- **Floating-Point Comparison**: A tolerance is used to check if the calculated area is close enough to \( S \). 

This should resolve the issues and allow the code to pass all tests.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

In my attempts to solve the problem of finding a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \), I encountered several challenges that ultimately led to incorrect outputs. The primary issues stemmed from the calculations of the triangle's sides and the area condition checks. My approach involved calculating the discriminant and deriving potential side lengths, but I failed to ensure that these calculations were robust enough to handle all edge cases, particularly with floating-point precision.

The official solution provided a more streamlined approach. It uses a mathematical formulation that directly computes the base \( B \) and height \( P \) of the triangle based on the hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \). The key steps in the official solution are:

1. **Discriminant Check**: It first checks if the expression \( (H^4 - 16S^2) \) is negative, which indicates that no valid triangle can be formed.
2. **Calculating Sides**: It calculates the base \( B \) and height \( P \) using derived formulas that ensure both sides are valid and satisfy the area condition.
3. **Output Formatting**: The solution formats the output to six decimal places and ensures the sides are printed in non-decreasing order.

The official solution's use of direct mathematical relationships simplifies the problem significantly compared to my approach, which involved more complex calculations and checks. This experience highlights the importance of leveraging mathematical properties and relationships in geometry problems to derive solutions more efficiently. 

In future attempts, I will focus on ensuring that my calculations are not only correct but also efficient and straightforward, particularly in problems involving geometric properties.
