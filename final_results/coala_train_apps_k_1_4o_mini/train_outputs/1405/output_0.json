    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We have a game with N sabotages, all starting at level 0. There are N imposters, and each imposter can increase the level of certain sabotages based on a condition involving the greatest common divisor (gcd). Specifically, the i-th imposter can increase the level of the x-th sabotage if the gcd of i and x equals i. We need to determine how many sabotages reach level 5 after all imposters have acted.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we need to understand how many times each sabotage can be upgraded to reach level 5. Each sabotage x can be upgraded by all imposters i that are divisors of x. Therefore, the level of sabotage x will be equal to the number of divisors of x. To find out how many sabotages reach level 5, we need to count how many numbers from 1 to N have exactly 5 divisors. \n\n   A number has exactly 5 divisors if it is of the form p^4, where p is a prime number. This is because the number of divisors function for p^k is k + 1. Thus, we need to find all prime numbers p such that p^4 \u2264 N.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_sabotages_at_level_5(N):\n       count = 0\n       for each prime p:\n           if p^4 <= N:\n               count += 1\n       return count\n\n   read T\n   for each testcase:\n       read N\n       result = count_sabotages_at_level_5(N)\n       print(result)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef count_primes_up_to(limit):\n    # This function will count the number of primes up to the limit using a simple sieve method\n    if limit < 2:\n        return 0\n    is_prime = [True] * (limit + 1)\n    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False\n    for start in range(2, int(limit**0.5) + 1):\n        if is_prime[start]:\n            for multiple in range(start*start, limit + 1, start):\n                is_prime[multiple] = False\n    return sum(is_prime)\n\ndef count_sabotages_at_level_5(N):\n    # We need to find the largest integer p such that p^4 <= N\n    # This means p <= N^(1/4)\n    max_p = int(N**0.25)\n    # Count the number of primes up to max_p\n    return count_primes_up_to(max_p)\n\nT = int(input())  # Read number of test cases\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())  # Read each value of N\n    result = count_sabotages_at_level_5(N)  # Calculate the result\n    print(result)  # Output the result\n```",
