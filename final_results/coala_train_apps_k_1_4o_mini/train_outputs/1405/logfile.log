## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
There are $N$ sabotages available in the game Among Us, initially all at level $0$. 
$N$ imposters are allotted the task to upgrade the level of the sabotages. 
The $i^{th}$ imposter $(1 \leq i \leq N)$ increases the level of $x^{th}$ sabotage $(1 \leq x \leq N)$ by one level  if $gcd(i,x)=i$.
You need to find the number of sabotages at LEVEL 5 after all the imposters have completed their tasks.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer $N$. 

-----Output:-----

INFO - [Task id] 1405 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a game with N sabotages, all starting at level 0. There are N imposters, and each imposter can increase the level of certain sabotages based on a condition involving the greatest common divisor (gcd). Specifically, the i-th imposter can increase the level of the x-th sabotage if the gcd of i and x equals i. We need to determine how many sabotages reach level 5 after all imposters have acted.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   Each sabotage can be upgraded by imposters whose indices are divisors of the sabotage's index. For a sabotage to reach level 5, it must be upgraded by 5 different imposters. This means that the index of the sabotage must have at least 5 distinct divisors. The number of distinct divisors of a number can be determined by its prime factorization. We need to find out how many numbers from 1 to N have at least 5 distinct divisors.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - For each test case:
     - Initialize a counter for sabotages at level 5.
     - Loop through numbers from 1 to N:
       - For each number, calculate the number of distinct divisors.
       - If the number of distinct divisors is 5 or more, increment the counter.
     - Output the counter.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series defined as 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, etc. Initially, I misidentified the formula for generating the series, which led to incorrect outputs. The series is generated by the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares, which can be calculated using the formula:

    \[ T(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2(N-1) + 1)}{6} \]

    This formula derives from the known formula for the sum of the first k squares.

    The initial approach incorrectly used a different formula, resulting in outputs that did not match the expected results. After analyzing the series and identifying the correct pattern, I revised the code to implement the correct formula, which successfully passed all test cases.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def find_nth_number(N):
        if N == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            return ((N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1)) // 6

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        result = find_nth_number(N)
        print(result)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring the correct mathematical formulas are applied.

Specifically, the i-th imposter can increase the level of the x-th sabotage if the gcd of i and x equals i. We need to determine how many sabotages reach level 5 after all imposters have acted.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to understand how many times each sabotage can be upgraded to reach level 5. Each sabotage x can be upgraded by all imposters i that are divisors of x. Therefore, the level of sabotage x will be equal to the number of divisors of x. To find out how many sabotages reach level 5, we need to count how many numbers from 1 to N have exactly 5 divisors. 

   A number has exactly 5 divisors if it is of the form p^4, where p is a prime number. This is because the number of divisors function for p^k is k + 1. Thus, we need to find all prime numbers p such that p^4 ≤ N.

INFO - [Task id] 1405 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine how many sabotages reach level 5 after all imposters have acted, based on the condition involving the greatest common divisor (gcd). The key insight was that a sabotage x reaches level 5 if it has exactly 5 divisors, which occurs when x is of the form p^4, where p is a prime number.

The solution involved calculating the largest integer p such that p^4 ≤ N, which translates to finding all prime numbers up to N^(1/4). I implemented a simple sieve method to count the number of primes up to this limit.

The final code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was sound, as evidenced by passing the provided test case. The approach of leveraging the properties of prime numbers and their relationship to the divisor count was effective. 

Key code snippet:
```python
def count_sabotages_at_level_5(N):
    max_p = int(N**0.25)
    return count_primes_up_to(max_p)
```

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding number theory concepts, particularly the relationship between prime numbers and divisor counts, in solving combinatorial problems efficiently.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
There are $N$ sabotages available in the game Among Us, initially all at level $0$. 
$N$ imposters are allotted the task to upgrade the level of the sabotages. 
The $i^{th}$ imposter $(1 \leq i \leq N)$ increases the level of $x^{th}$ sabotage $(1 \leq x \leq N)$ by one level  if $gcd(i,x)=i$.
You need to find the number of sabotages at LEVEL 5 after all the imposters have completed their tasks.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer $N$.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1405 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a game with N sabotages, all starting at level 0. There are N imposters, and each imposter can increase the level of certain sabotages based on a condition involving the greatest common divisor (gcd). Specifically, the i-th imposter can increase the level of the x-th sabotage if the gcd of i and x equals i. We need to determine how many sabotages reach level 5 after all imposters have acted.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to understand how many times each sabotage can be upgraded to reach level 5. Each sabotage x can be upgraded by all imposters i that are divisors of x. Therefore, the level of sabotage x will be equal to the number of divisors of x. To find out how many sabotages reach level 5, we need to count how many numbers from 1 to N have exactly 5 divisors. 

   A number has exactly 5 divisors if it is of the form p^4, where p is a prime number. This is because the number of divisors function for p^k is k + 1. Thus, we need to find all prime numbers p such that p^4 ≤ N.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_sabotages_at_level_5(N):
       count = 0
       for each prime p:
           if p^4 <= N:
               count += 1
       return count

   read T
   for each testcase:
       read N
       result = count_sabotages_at_level_5(N)
       print(result)
   ```

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1405 [generation text] The official solution employs a more efficient approach to solve the problem of counting how many sabotages reach level 5. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Prime Sieve Implementation**: The solution uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all prime numbers up to 32,000. This is efficient for generating primes and allows for quick access to prime numbers.

2. **Calculating Powers**: After generating the list of primes, the solution computes the fourth power of each prime (p^4) and stores these values in a list. This is crucial because a number has exactly 5 divisors if it can be expressed as p^4, where p is a prime.

3. **Binary Search for Efficiency**: The solution uses the `bisect` module to quickly count how many of these p^4 values are less than or equal to N. This allows for efficient querying, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 10^18.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The solution reads multiple test cases in a single run, which is efficient for large inputs.

In contrast, my initial approach involved counting primes up to the fourth root of N directly, which could be less efficient due to the need to check each number for primality. The official solution's use of precomputed primes and binary search significantly optimizes the process, especially for large values of N.

Overall, the official solution is more effective in terms of time complexity and handles the problem constraints better. The use of a sieve and binary search is a valuable technique that I can apply in future problems involving prime numbers and counting based on specific conditions.
