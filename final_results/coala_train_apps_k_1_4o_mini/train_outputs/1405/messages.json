Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Prime Sieve Implementation**: The solution uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all prime numbers up to 32,000. This is efficient for generating primes and allows for quick access to prime numbers.\n\n2. **Calculating Powers**: After generating the list of primes, the solution computes the fourth power of each prime (p^4) and stores these values in a list. This is crucial because a number has exactly 5 divisors if it can be expressed as p^4, where p is a prime.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Efficiency**: The solution uses the `bisect` module to quickly count how many of these p^4 values are less than or equal to N. This allows for efficient querying, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 10^18.\n\n4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The solution reads multiple test cases in a single run, which is efficient for large inputs.\n\nIn contrast, my initial approach involved counting primes up to the fourth root of N directly, which could be less efficient due to the need to check each number for primality. The official solution's use of precomputed primes and binary search significantly optimizes the process, especially for large values of N.\n\nOverall, the official solution is more effective in terms of time complexity and handles the problem constraints better. The use of a sieve and binary search is a valuable technique that I can apply in future problems involving prime numbers and counting based on specific conditions."
