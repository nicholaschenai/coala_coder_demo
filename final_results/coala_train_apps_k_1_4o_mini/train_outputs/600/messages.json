Now, you should perform the following process:\n- Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \\ldots, D_l)$.\n- If $l = 1$, the process ends.\n- Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \\ldots, D_{2 \\lfloor l/2 \\rfloor})$.

Specifically, it calculates the length of the binary representation of \\( N \\) and derives the index by using powers of 2. This approach is clever as it directly relates the problem of reducing the sequence to a binary tree structure, where each level corresponds to halving the sequence.\n\n3. **Modulo Operation**: The final result is obtained by taking the modulo of the derived index with 60, which corresponds to the periodicity of the last digits of Fibonacci numbers.\n\n### Comparison with My Approach:\n- My approach involved generating the last digits for the first \\( N \\) Fibonacci numbers directly, which is infeasible for large \\( N \\). The official solution's method of using the periodicity of the last digits is far more efficient.\n- I also implemented a loop to reduce the sequence by removing odd-indexed elements, which is unnecessary given the binary representation method used in the official solution.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe official solution is more optimal in both time and space complexity.

In future problems, I should consider looking for such patterns early in the problem-solving process."

It first determines the index within the Pisano period for N, which is used to find the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers. These last digits are precomputed and stored in a list. The function then initializes a sequence with the last digits up to the calculated index and iteratively reduces this sequence by keeping only the elements at even indices. Finally, it returns the last remaining digit from the reduced sequence.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to efficiently compute the last remaining digit of a sequence derived from the Fibonacci numbers, especially when dealing with large inputs. It can be applied in competitive programming, algorithm design, and mathematical problem-solving where Fibonacci sequences and modular arithmetic are involved. Understanding the Pisano period helps in reducing the computational complexity when the input size is very large, such as up to 10^18, making it applicable in performance-critical applications."
