    "raw_msg": "Let's fix the solution to ensure it correctly calculates the minimum number of moves required to sort the books on the shelf. The main issue was related to how the input was processed and ensuring that the output is formatted correctly.\n\nHere\u2019s the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef min_moves_to_sort(N, books):\n    # Initialize a counter for books in the correct position\n    correct_position_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the list of books\n    for i in range(N):\n        # Check if the book is in its correct position\n        if books[i] == i + 1:\n            correct_position_count += 1  # Increment the counter if correct\n    \n    # The minimum moves required is the total books minus those in correct position\n    return N - correct_position_count\n\n# Read input values\nN = int(input())\nbooks = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))  # Ensure proper conversion to integers\n\n# Output the result\nprint(min_moves_to_sort(N, books))  # Ensure output is a single integer\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `min_moves_to_sort` takes two parameters: `N` (the number of books) and `books` (the list of books in their current order).\n2. **Counting Correct Positions**: We iterate through the list of books and count how many books are in their correct position (i.e., the book at index `i` should be `i + 1`).\n3. **Calculating Moves**: The minimum number of moves required to sort the books is calculated as the total number of books minus the count of books that are already in the correct position.\n4. **Input Handling**: The input is read, and the list of books is converted from strings to integers.\n5. **Output**: Finally, the result is printed as a single integer.\n\nThis code should now work correctly for the given problem and pass all tests.",
