    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   Indraneel has a collection of books arranged in a specific order, and he wants to rearrange them in ascending order (from 1 to N). He can move any book to any position on the shelf. The goal is to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to identify how many books are already in their correct position. The books that are not in the correct position will need to be moved. The minimum number of moves required will be equal to the total number of books minus the number of books that are already in the correct order. We can achieve this by iterating through the list of books and counting how many are in the correct position.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function min_moves_to_sort(N, books):\n       correct_position_count = 0\n       for i from 0 to N-1:\n           if books[i] == i + 1:\n               correct_position_count += 1\n       return N - correct_position_count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef min_moves_to_sort(N, books):\n    # Initialize a counter for books in the correct position\n    correct_position_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the list of books\n    for i in range(N):\n        # Check if the book is in its correct position\n        if books[i] == i + 1:\n            correct_position_count += 1  # Increment the counter if correct\n    \n    # The minimum moves required is the total books minus those in correct position\n    return N - correct_position_count\n\n# Read input values\nN = int(input())\nbooks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Output the result\nprint(min_moves_to_sort(N, books))\n```",
