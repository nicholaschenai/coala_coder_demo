The main challenge was ensuring that the jumps adhered to the constraints of the problem, particularly that the value at the starting index must be greater than the target index and all values in between.\n\n    The first attempt had issues with counting unique indices correctly, leading to over-counting due to revisiting indices in different paths. Additionally, the checks for valid jumps were not robust enough, which resulted in incorrect outputs.\n\n    To address these issues, I introduced a memoization technique to store results for previously computed indices, which significantly improved efficiency. I also refined the jump validity checks to ensure that all values between the starting and target indices were less than the starting index's value.\n\n    The final working solution effectively utilized memoization and correctly implemented the jump conditions, passing all test cases. The key takeaway is the importance of managing state (visited indices) and ensuring that conditions for valid transitions are strictly enforced in recursive algorithms. \n\n    Here is the final code snippet that successfully solved the problem:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def maxJumps(self, arr: list[int], d: int) -> int:\n        \n            n = len(arr)\n            memo = [-1] * n  # Memoization array to store results for each index\n        \n            def dfs(index):\n                if memo[index] != -1:  # Return already computed result\n                    return memo[index]\n            \n                max_reachable = 1  # Count the current index\n            \n                # Check jumps to the right\n                for x in range(1, d + 1):\n                    if index + x < n and arr[index] > arr[index + x]:\n                        if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index + 1, index + x + 1)):\n                            max_reachable = max(max_reachable, 1 + dfs(index + x))\n                    else:\n                        break\n            \n                # Check jumps to the left\n                for x in range(1, d + 1):\n                    if index - x >= 0 and arr[index] > arr[index - x]:\n                        if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index - x, index)):\n                            max_reachable = max(max_reachable, 1 + dfs(index - x))\n                    else:\n                        break\n            \n                memo[index] = max_reachable  # Store the result in memo\n                return max_reachable\n        \n            max_count = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                max_count = max(max_count, dfs(i))  # Compute max jumps starting from each index\n        \n            return max_count\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Instead of iterating through all possible subarrays explicitly, it uses a set to keep track of the current results dynamically. This significantly reduces the time complexity compared to the nested loop approach I initially implemented.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n1. **Dynamic Update of Results**: The official solution maintains a `cur` set that dynamically updates the results of the bitwise OR operation as it iterates through each element in the array. For each element `a`, it computes the new results by performing a bitwise OR with all existing results in `cur`.\n\n2. **Set Operations**: The use of set operations (`cur = {a | i for i in cur}` and `cur |= {a}`) allows for efficient accumulation of unique results without needing to check for duplicates manually. This is more efficient than adding results to a list and then converting it to a set later.\n\n3. **Final Result Calculation**: The final unique results are stored in the `res` set, which is updated with the current results after processing each element. The length of this set gives the count of unique bitwise OR results.\n\n### Comparison to My Approach:\n- My approach involved nested loops to explicitly calculate the OR for each subarray, which is less efficient, especially for larger arrays. The official solution's method of building results incrementally is more optimal.\n- The official solution effectively reduces the number of operations by leveraging the properties of the bitwise OR operation and set comprehensions, leading to better performance.\n\nIn summary, the official solution is a more elegant and efficient way to tackle the problem, demonstrating the power of dynamic programming and set operations in reducing complexity. This experience highlights the importance of considering alternative approaches that can simplify the problem-solving process."
