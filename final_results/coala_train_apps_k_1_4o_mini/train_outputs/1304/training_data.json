    "summary": "The task involved generating the next permutation of a sequence of numbers in lexicographic order. The core concepts tested included understanding permutations, identifying the longest descending suffix, and performing swaps and reversals to achieve the desired output.\n\nThe solution was structured into a main function `next_permutation` and a helper function `reverse`. The algorithm followed these steps: finding the longest descending suffix, identifying the pivot, swapping the pivot with the next larger element, and reversing the suffix. This approach effectively generates the next permutation in linear time.\n\nOne key takeaway was the importance of handling edge cases, such as when the input permutation is the last permutation in lexicographic order, which requires reversing the entire list. The implementation successfully handled multiple permutations as input and produced the correct output format.\n\nThe final code snippet is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef reverse(arr):\n    left = 0\n    right = len(arr) - 1\n    while left < right:\n        arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]\n        left += 1\n        right -= 1\n\ndef next_permutation(perm):\n    i = len(perm) - 2\n    while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:\n        i -= 1\n    \n    if i < 0:\n        reverse(perm)\n        return perm\n    \n    j = len(perm) - 1\n    while perm[j] <= perm[i]:\n        j -= 1\n    \n    perm[i], perm[j] = perm[j], perm[i]\n    reverse(perm[i + 1:])\n    \n    return perm\n\nN, K = map(int, input().split())\nfor _ in range(K):\n    permutation = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    next_perm = next_permutation(permutation)\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, next_perm)))\n``` \n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of understanding algorithmic patterns in permutation problems and the need for careful handling of input and output formats.",
    "reflection": "The official solution effectively implements the algorithm to find the next lexicographic permutation of a sequence. Here are the key insights and steps that stand out:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The official solution uses helper functions to read input efficiently. This is a good practice for competitive programming as it simplifies the main logic and improves readability.\n\n2. **Finding the Pivot**: The solution iterates through the array in reverse to find the first element that is smaller than its next element. This identifies the pivot point where the permutation can be increased.\n\n3. **Finding the Successor**: Once the pivot is found, the solution looks for the smallest element in the suffix that is larger than the pivot. This ensures that the next permutation is the smallest possible increment.\n\n4. **Swapping and Sorting**: After swapping the pivot with the identified successor, the solution sorts the suffix to ensure it is in the lowest possible order, which is crucial for generating the next permutation.\n\n5. **Efficiency**: The approach is efficient, operating in O(n) time for finding the pivot and successor, and O(n log n) for sorting the suffix. Given the constraints, this is manageable.\n\n6. **Output**: The use of unpacking in the print statement (`print(*arr)`) is a concise way to output the array elements.\n\nIn contrast, my initial solution was similar in logic but lacked clarity in input handling and could have benefited from more structured helper functions. Additionally, I did not explicitly sort the suffix after the swap, which is essential for ensuring the next permutation is correct. \n\nOverall, the official solution is a solid implementation that adheres to best practices in competitive programming, particularly in terms of input handling and algorithm efficiency.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: next_permutation]\nThis function generates the next lexicographical permutation of a given list of integers. It first identifies the longest descending suffix in the list to determine the pivot for swapping. If the entire list is in descending order, it reverses the list to return the smallest permutation. Otherwise, it finds the next larger element to the pivot and swaps them. Finally, it reverses the suffix to ensure the next permutation is the smallest possible. The function returns the modified list representing the next permutation.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to generate permutations in a systematic way, particularly when working with combinatorial problems, algorithm design, or optimization tasks. It can be applied in fields such as computer science, mathematics, and operations research, where understanding the order of arrangements is crucial. For example, it can help in solving problems related to scheduling, resource allocation, or generating test cases for software testing. Additionally, this approach can be beneficial in competitive programming where efficient generation of permutations is often required."
