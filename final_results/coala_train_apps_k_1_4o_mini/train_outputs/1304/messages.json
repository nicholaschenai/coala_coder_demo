However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, \u2026, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.\nHowever, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, \u2026, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:\n123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \\, 2 \\, 3 \\quad    1 \\, 3 \\, 2 \\quad     2 \\, 1 \\, 3 \\quad     2 \\, 3 \\, 1 \\quad     3 \\, 1 \\, 2 \\quad     3 \\, 2 \\, 1 \nThe problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, \u2026, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.\n\n-----Input:-----\nThe first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,\u2026,N$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nThe output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 1000$.\n- $1 \\leq K \\leq 10$.\n\n-----Sample input-----\n3 2\n3 1 2\n2 3 1\n\n-----Sample output-----\n3 2 1\n3 1 2\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is \\(N \\times (N - 1) / 2\\).\n\n    #### Key Concepts:\n    1. **Maximum and Minimum Values of f(P):** The maximum value occurs with a descending permutation, while the minimum is 0 (for N = 1).\n    2. **Adjustment of Permutation:** The challenge was to adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K by swapping elements to reduce the contribution of adjacent maximums.\n\n    #### Strategies and Issues:\n    - The initial approach involved starting with a descending permutation and attempting to reduce f(P) by swapping adjacent elements. However, this logic was flawed as it did not effectively account for how adjacent maximums changed with swaps.\n    - The code consistently returned `-1` for valid cases, indicating a failure to construct the desired permutation.\n\n    #### Lessons Learned:\n    - A more systematic approach is needed to generate permutations that can achieve specific values of K. The adjustment logic must be refined to ensure that all possible values of f(P) can be reached.\n    - Future implementations should focus on a clearer strategy for adjusting the permutation based on the difference between the current f(P) and the target K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n    The following code snippet represents the last attempt, which ultimately failed to pass the test cases:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n        results = []  # To store results for each test case\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum possible f(P)\n        \n            if K > max_f or K < 0:  # Check if K is out of bounds\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                # Start with the descending permutation\n                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                current_f = max_f  # Start with the maximum f(P)\n            \n                # Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K\n                for i in range(N - 1):\n                    if current_f == K:\n                        break\n                    # If we can reduce the current_f by 1, we swap elements\n                    if current_f > K:\n                        # Swap the last two elements to reduce the f(P) value\n                        permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                        current_f -= 1  # Decrease the f(P) value by 1\n            \n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))  # Store the result as a string\n\n        # Print all results at once for efficiency\n        print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n    ```\n\n    This summary encapsulates the core concepts, strategies attempted, and the lessons learned from the problem-solving process.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The algorithm followed these steps: finding the longest descending suffix, identifying the pivot, swapping the pivot with the next larger element, and reversing the suffix.

This identifies the pivot point where the permutation can be increased.\n\n3. **Finding the Successor**: Once the pivot is found, the solution looks for the smallest element in the suffix that is larger than the pivot. This ensures that the next permutation is the smallest possible increment.\n\n4. **Swapping and Sorting**: After swapping the pivot with the identified successor, the solution sorts the suffix to ensure it is in the lowest possible order, which is crucial for generating the next permutation.\n\n5. **Efficiency**: The approach is efficient, operating in O(n) time for finding the pivot and successor, and O(n log n) for sorting the suffix. Given the constraints, this is manageable.\n\n6. **Output**: The use of unpacking in the print statement (`print(*arr)`) is a concise way to output the array elements.\n\nIn contrast, my initial solution was similar in logic but lacked clarity in input handling and could have benefited from more structured helper functions.
