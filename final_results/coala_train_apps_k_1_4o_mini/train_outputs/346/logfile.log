INFO - [Task id] 346 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the number of continuous subarrays within a given list of integers that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We will maintain a count of odd numbers in the current window (subarray). We will expand the window by moving the right pointer and include new elements. If the count of odd numbers exceeds `k`, we will move the left pointer to reduce the count. We will also keep track of how many times we have seen subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers by using a helper function to count subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function countAtMostK(nums, k):
       Initialize count = 0
       Initialize left = 0
       Initialize odd_count = 0
       for right from 0 to length of nums:
           if nums[right] is odd:
               increment odd_count
           while odd_count > k:
               if nums[left] is odd:
                   decrement odd_count
               increment left
           count += (right - left + 1)

## Memories

[Summary]:
    The problem involved calculating the number of unique results from the bitwise OR of all contiguous subarrays of a given array of non-negative integers. The key insight was that the bitwise OR operation is cumulative, allowing us to efficiently compute results without recalculating from scratch for each subarray.

    The solution involved iterating through each possible starting index of the subarrays and then extending to each possible ending index, updating the current OR result and storing it in a set to ensure uniqueness. This approach effectively captured all unique results.

    The final implementation was straightforward and passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was sound. The code snippet used is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: list[int]) -> int:
            unique_results = set()
            for i in range(len(A)):
                current_or = 0
                for j in range(i, len(A)):
                    current_or |= A[j]
                    unique_results.add(current_or)
            return len(unique_results)
    ```

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding cumulative operations and leveraging data structures like sets for uniqueness in results. No unexpected errors were encountered, and the solution was efficient enough given the constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 346 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to find the number of continuous subarrays within a given list of integers that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We will maintain a count of odd numbers in the current window (subarray). We will expand the window by moving the right pointer and include more elements until we have at least `k` odd numbers. Once we have `k` odd numbers, we will count how many valid subarrays can be formed by moving the left pointer. We will also need to handle cases where we have more than `k` odd numbers by adjusting the left pointer accordingly.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function numberOfSubarrays(nums, k):
       initialize count = 0
       initialize left = 0
       initialize odd_count = 0
       initialize result = 0

INFO - [Task id] 346 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays containing exactly `k` odd numbers from a given list of integers. The solution utilized a sliding window approach, which is effective for problems involving contiguous subarrays and counts.

The core concept involved maintaining a count of odd numbers within a window defined by two pointers (left and right). The function `atMostK(k)` was implemented to count subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers, which allowed us to derive the count of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers by calculating the difference between `atMostK(k)` and `atMostK(k - 1)`.

The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test cases. The sliding window technique proved to be efficient, as it allowed for linear traversal of the array while dynamically adjusting the window size based on the count of odd numbers. This approach minimized unnecessary computations and handled edge cases effectively. 

Overall, the experience reinforced the utility of the sliding window technique in solving subarray-related problems and highlighted the importance of counting strategies in combinatorial problems.

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
class Solution:
    def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # save all even subarray's length which between odds
        edge = []
        res = 0

            # odd

                # +1 because range from 0 to count when doing combination
                edge.append(count+1)
                count = 0
            # even
            else:
                count += 1
        edge.append(count+1)
        # no enough odd
        if len(edge)-1 < k:
            return 0
        else:
            # combination
            for i in range(len(edge)-k):
                res += edge[i] * edge[i+k]
            return res

INFO - [Task id] 346 [generation text] The official solution employs a different approach that focuses on counting the lengths of even subarrays that are situated between odd numbers. This method is efficient and leverages combinatorial counting to derive the number of valid subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:

1. **Edge Array**: The solution constructs an `edge` array that stores the lengths of even subarrays found between odd numbers. This allows for easy calculation of how many valid subarrays can be formed.

2. **Counting Combinations**: Instead of iterating through all possible subarrays, the solution calculates the number of valid combinations of even-length segments that can be formed with the odd numbers. For each segment of odd numbers, it multiplies the lengths of the even segments before and after the `k`-th odd number to get the total count of valid subarrays.

3. **Efficiency**: This approach is more efficient than the sliding window method I initially used, as it avoids the need for nested loops and directly computes the result using the lengths of segments. The time complexity is linear, O(n), which is optimal for this problem.

### Reflection on My Approach:

While my sliding window approach was valid and passed the provided test cases, it was less efficient in terms of clarity and performance compared to the official solution. The official solution's use of combinatorial counting simplifies the problem significantly and reduces the number of operations needed to arrive at the result. 

In future problems, especially those involving counting subarrays or combinations, considering a combinatorial approach or segment-based counting could lead to more efficient solutions.
