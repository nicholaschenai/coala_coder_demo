The solution involved using a hashmap to track cumulative sums, which allowed for efficient counting of valid subarrays.\n\nThe core concept tested here was the use of cumulative sums and hashmaps to optimize the search for subarrays that meet a specific sum condition. By maintaining a running total of the cumulative sum and checking for the existence of a previously seen cumulative sum that, when subtracted from the current sum, equals `k`, we could efficiently count the number of valid subarrays.\n\nThe implemented solution was successful and passed the provided test case. The key strategies that worked included initializing the hashmap with a base case to handle scenarios where the cumulative sum directly equals `k`, and updating the hashmap as we iterated through the array. This approach avoided the need for nested loops, significantly improving performance for larger input sizes.\n\nOverall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding cumulative sums and their applications in solving problems related to subarray sums efficiently.
