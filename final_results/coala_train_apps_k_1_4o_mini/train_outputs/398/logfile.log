## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.

The range of numbers in the array is [-1000, 1000] and the range of the integer k is [-1e7, 1e7].

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

INFO - [Task id] 398 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find how many continuous subarrays (a contiguous part of the array) in a given list of integers have a sum that equals a specified integer `k`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a hashmap (dictionary) to keep track of the cumulative sums we encounter as we iterate through the array. For each element in the array, we calculate the cumulative sum up to that point. If the difference between the cumulative sum and `k` exists in our hashmap, it means there is a subarray that sums to `k`. We will also keep a count of how many times each cumulative sum has occurred to help us find the number of valid subarrays.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize a hashmap to store cumulative sums and their counts
   Initialize a variable to keep track of the cumulative sum
   Initialize a variable to count the number of valid subarrays

   For each number in the array:
       Update the cumulative sum by adding the current number
       If the cumulative sum equals k, increment the count
       If (cumulative sum - k) exists in the hashmap, add its count to the total count
       Update the hashmap with the current cumulative sum
   Return the total count
   ```

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
           We need to find the number of continuous subarrays within a given list of integers that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
           To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We will maintain a count of odd numbers in the current window (subarray). We will expand the window by moving the right pointer and include more elements until we have at least `k` odd numbers. Once we have `k` odd numbers, we will count how many valid subarrays can be formed by moving the left pointer. We will also need to handle cases where we have more than `k` odd numbers by adjusting the left pointer accordingly.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
           ```
           function numberOfSubarrays(nums, k):
               initialize count = 0
               initialize left = 0
               initialize odd_count = 0
               initialize result = 0

               for right from 0 to length of nums:
                   if nums[right] is odd:
                       increment odd_count

                   while odd_count > k:
                       if nums[left] is odd:
                           decrement odd_count
                       increment left

                   if odd_count == k:
                       temp_left = left
                       while temp_left < right and nums[temp_left] is even:
                           increment temp_left
                       count = temp_left - left + 1
                       result += count

               return result

   We need to find the total number of continuous subarrays within a given list of integers that sum up to a specified integer `k`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a hashmap (dictionary) to keep track of the cumulative sums we have seen so far. As we iterate through the array, we calculate the cumulative sum at each index. If the difference between the current cumulative sum and `k` exists in our hashmap, it means there are subarrays that sum to `k`. We will also keep track of how many times each cumulative sum has occurred to count the number of valid subarrays.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function subarraySum(nums, k):

       initialize count = 0
       initialize hashmap with {0: 1}  # To handle the case where cumulative_sum equals k

           if (cumulative_sum - k) exists in hashmap:

INFO - [Task id] 398 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to find the total number of continuous subarrays within a list of integers that sum up to a specified integer `k`. The solution involved using a hashmap to track cumulative sums, which allowed for efficient counting of valid subarrays.

The core concept tested here was the use of cumulative sums and hashmaps to optimize the search for subarrays that meet a specific sum condition. By maintaining a running total of the cumulative sum and checking for the existence of a previously seen cumulative sum that, when subtracted from the current sum, equals `k`, we could efficiently count the number of valid subarrays.

The implemented solution was successful and passed the provided test case. The key strategies that worked included initializing the hashmap with a base case to handle scenarios where the cumulative sum directly equals `k`, and updating the hashmap as we iterated through the array. This approach avoided the need for nested loops, significantly improving performance for larger input sizes.

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding cumulative sums and their applications in solving problems related to subarray sums efficiently. The final code snippet is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
        cumulative_sum = 0
        count = 0
        hashmap = {0: 1}  # To handle the case where cumulative_sum equals k

        for number in nums:
            cumulative_sum += number

            else:
                hashmap[cumulative_sum] = 1

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution

     def subarraySum(self, nums, k):
         """
         :type nums: List[int]

             numSum += nums[i]
             if (numSum - k) in dic:
                 ans += dic[numSum - k]
             if numSum in dic:
                 dic[numSum] += 1
             else:
                 dic[numSum] = 1
         return ans

INFO - [Task id] 398 [generation text] The official solution effectively utilizes a hashmap to track cumulative sums, which is a key insight for solving the problem of finding continuous subarrays that sum to a given integer `k`. The approach is efficient, operating in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input array. This is achieved by iterating through the array once while maintaining a running total of the cumulative sum.

Key steps in the official solution include:

1. **Initialization**: A dictionary (`dic`) is initialized to store the frequency of cumulative sums, starting with `{0: 1}` to account for cases where a subarray from the beginning sums to `k`.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: As we iterate through the array, we continuously update the cumulative sum (`numSum`).

3. **Check for Subarrays**: For each cumulative sum, the solution checks if the difference between the current cumulative sum and `k` exists in the dictionary. If it does, it indicates that there are subarrays that sum to `k`, and the count is updated accordingly.

4. **Update the Dictionary**: The cumulative sum is then added to the dictionary or its count is incremented if it already exists.

The official solution is concise and avoids unnecessary complexity, making it a robust approach to the problem. My initial solution was similar in logic but could have been more clearly articulated in terms of variable naming and comments. Overall, the official solution serves as a solid reference for efficiently handling problems involving subarray sums.
