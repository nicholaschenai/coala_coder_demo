Today he came with the following problem.\n\nYou are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string \"abacaba\" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?\n\nEach question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string \"a?b?c\" can be transformed into strings \"aabbc\" and \"azbzc\", but can't be transformed into strings \"aabc\", \"a?bbc\" and \"babbc\".\n\nOccurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \\leq i \\leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string \"ababa\" has two occurrences of a string \"aba\" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string \"aba\" in the string \"acba\" as a substring.\n\nPlease help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string \"abacaba\" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \\leq T \\leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.\n\nThe first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \\leq n \\leq 50$), length of a string $s$.\n\nThe second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case output an answer for it.\n\nIn case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string \"abacaba\" in the resulting string as a substring output \"No\".\n\nOtherwise output \"Yes\" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.\n\nYou may print every letter in \"Yes\" and \"No\" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n7\nabacaba\n7\n???????\n11\naba?abacaba\n11\nabacaba?aba\n15\nasdf???f???qwer\n11\nabacabacaba\n\nOutput\nYes\nabacaba\nYes\nabacaba\nYes\nabadabacaba\nYes\nabacabadaba\nNo\nNo\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string \"abacaba\" in the string \"abacaba\" as a substring.\n\nIn second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with \"abacaba\" in particular.\n\nIn sixth example there are two occurrences of a string \"abacaba\" as a substring.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

If the function is not called, no output will be produced.\n\n2. **Logic for Placing \"abacaba\"**: The logic for checking if \"abacaba\" can be placed at a certain position is correct. However, we need to ensure that we are not inadvertently allowing multiple placements of \"abacaba\" in the string.\n\n3. **Counting Occurrences**: After placing \"abacaba\" and replacing the remaining question marks, we check if \"abacaba\" appears exactly once.

This is generally a good practice, but we need to ensure that the output format matches the expected output.\n\n5. **Multiple Test Cases**: The code should handle multiple test cases correctly, ensuring that each test case is processed independently.\n\n### Where I Went Wrong:\n- **Function Call**: The `solve()` function was not called, which means the logic inside it was never executed.\n- **Output Handling**: The output format may not match the expected format, especially if the environment expects a specific structure.\n- **Counting Logic**: We need to ensure that we are correctly counting the occurrences of \"abacaba\" after modifying the string.\n\n### Revised Plan:\n1.

Allowing multiple placements of \"abacaba\" without proper checks.\n2. Incorrectly counting occurrences after modifications, leading to outputs that did not match expectations.\n\nThe solution involved iterating through potential placements, modifying the string, and checking the final count of \"abacaba\". The final implementation correctly handled these checks but still produced incorrect outputs due to not properly managing the placement logic.\n\nIn future attempts, I would focus on:\n- Ensuring that once \"abacaba\" is placed, no further placements are considered.\n- Implementing a more robust counting mechanism to verify the exact occurrence of the substring after all modifications. \n\nThe final code structure included reading input, processing each test case, and outputting results, but it still required refinement to meet all test cases successfully."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "In this problem, the goal was to determine if we could replace question marks in a string such that the substring \"abacaba\" appears exactly once. My initial attempts to solve the problem had several shortcomings, particularly in ensuring that only one valid placement of \"abacaba\" was allowed and correctly counting its occurrences.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Initial Count Check**: The official solution starts by counting how many times \"abacaba\" appears in the string. If it appears more than once, it immediately outputs \"No\". This is a crucial step that I overlooked in my attempts, as I did not check for existing occurrences before attempting to place \"abacaba\".\n\n2. **Constructing the String**: If \"abacaba\" is not found, the solution constructs a potential string by iterating through possible starting positions. It checks if \"abacaba\" can fit at each position, replacing question marks with the corresponding characters from \"abacaba\". This approach is systematic and ensures that all possible placements are considered.\n\n3. **Final Validation**: After constructing a candidate string, the solution checks again to ensure that \"abacaba\" appears exactly once. This double-checking is essential to avoid false positives.\n\n4. **Handling Remaining Question Marks**: The official solution replaces any remaining question marks with 'z' after placing \"abacaba\", ensuring that the string is fully populated.\n\n### Reasons for My Approach's Failure:\n- **Lack of Initial Count Check**: I did not check for existing occurrences of \"abacaba\" before attempting to place it, which led to incorrect outputs when multiple placements were possible.\n- **Output Duplication**: My solution allowed for multiple valid placements of \"abacaba\", leading to multiple \"Yes\" outputs for the same test case.\n- **Inefficient Validation**: My approach did not efficiently validate the final string after modifications, which is crucial for ensuring correctness.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe official solution effectively breaks down the problem into manageable steps, ensuring that all edge cases are handled. Moving forward, I will incorporate these insights into my problem-solving approach, particularly the importance of initial checks and systematic construction of potential solutions."
