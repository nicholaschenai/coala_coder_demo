    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to determine if we could replace question marks in a string with lowercase letters such that the substring \"abacaba\" appears exactly once. The main challenges included ensuring that only one valid placement of \"abacaba\" was allowed and that the final string met the criteria.\n\nKey concepts involved:\n- **Substring Placement**: The ability to check if \"abacaba\" can be placed at various positions in the string while respecting existing characters.\n- **Counting Occurrences**: After modifying the string, it was crucial to count how many times \"abacaba\" appeared to ensure it was exactly once.\n\nThe initial attempts failed primarily due to:\n1. Allowing multiple placements of \"abacaba\" without proper checks.\n2. Incorrectly counting occurrences after modifications, leading to outputs that did not match expectations.\n\nThe solution involved iterating through potential placements, modifying the string, and checking the final count of \"abacaba\". The final implementation correctly handled these checks but still produced incorrect outputs due to not properly managing the placement logic.\n\nIn future attempts, I would focus on:\n- Ensuring that once \"abacaba\" is placed, no further placements are considered.\n- Implementing a more robust counting mechanism to verify the exact occurrence of the substring after all modifications. \n\nThe final code structure included reading input, processing each test case, and outputting results, but it still required refinement to meet all test cases successfully.",
    "reflection": "In this problem, the goal was to determine if we could replace question marks in a string such that the substring \"abacaba\" appears exactly once. My initial attempts to solve the problem had several shortcomings, particularly in ensuring that only one valid placement of \"abacaba\" was allowed and correctly counting its occurrences.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Initial Count Check**: The official solution starts by counting how many times \"abacaba\" appears in the string. If it appears more than once, it immediately outputs \"No\". This is a crucial step that I overlooked in my attempts, as I did not check for existing occurrences before attempting to place \"abacaba\".\n\n2. **Constructing the String**: If \"abacaba\" is not found, the solution constructs a potential string by iterating through possible starting positions. It checks if \"abacaba\" can fit at each position, replacing question marks with the corresponding characters from \"abacaba\". This approach is systematic and ensures that all possible placements are considered.\n\n3. **Final Validation**: After constructing a candidate string, the solution checks again to ensure that \"abacaba\" appears exactly once. This double-checking is essential to avoid false positives.\n\n4. **Handling Remaining Question Marks**: The official solution replaces any remaining question marks with 'z' after placing \"abacaba\", ensuring that the string is fully populated.\n\n### Reasons for My Approach's Failure:\n- **Lack of Initial Count Check**: I did not check for existing occurrences of \"abacaba\" before attempting to place it, which led to incorrect outputs when multiple placements were possible.\n- **Output Duplication**: My solution allowed for multiple valid placements of \"abacaba\", leading to multiple \"Yes\" outputs for the same test case.\n- **Inefficient Validation**: My approach did not efficiently validate the final string after modifications, which is crucial for ensuring correctness.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe official solution effectively breaks down the problem into manageable steps, ensuring that all edge cases are handled. Moving forward, I will incorporate these insights into my problem-solving approach, particularly the importance of initial checks and systematic construction of potential solutions.",
