    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   You start with one stick and want to craft a certain number of torches, each requiring one stick and one coal. You can trade one stick for a certain number of sticks or trade a certain number of sticks for one coal. The goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft the desired number of torches.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To craft `k` torches, you need `k` coals and `k` sticks. Since you start with one stick, you need to acquire `k - 1` additional sticks. To get the required coals, you need to trade `k * y` sticks (since each coal requires `y` sticks). Therefore, the total number of sticks needed is `k - 1 + k * y`. After trading for sticks, you can then trade for coals. The number of trades will be the sum of the trades for sticks and the trades for coals.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   For each test case:\n       Read x, y, k\n       Calculate total_sticks_needed = k - 1 + k * y\n       Calculate trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed + (x - 1)) // x\n       Calculate trades_for_coals = k\n       total_trades = trades_for_sticks + trades_for_coals\n       Print total_trades\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef minimum_trades(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(t):\n        # Read x, y, k for the current test case\n        x, y, k = test_cases[i]\n        \n        # Calculate the total number of sticks needed\n        total_sticks_needed = k - 1 + k * y\n        \n        # Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required sticks\n        trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed + (x - 1)) // x\n        \n        # Each torch requires one coal, so we need k trades for coals\n        trades_for_coals = k\n        \n        # Total trades is the sum of trades for sticks and trades for coals\n        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + trades_for_coals\n        \n        # Store the result for this test case\n        results.append(total_trades)\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Example usage:\n# t = number of test cases\n# test_cases = list of tuples (x, y, k) for each test case\n```\nThis code defines a function `minimum_trades` that processes multiple test cases and calculates the minimum number of trades required for each case, printing the results accordingly.",
