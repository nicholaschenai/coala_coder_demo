    "raw_msg": "Based on the previous analysis and the insights gained, I will provide a corrected solution for the problem of determining the minimum number of trades needed to craft `k` torches in the game Cubecraft. \n\n### Key Points to Address:\n1. **Understanding the Requirements**: \n   - You need `k` sticks and `k` coals to craft `k` torches.\n   - You start with one stick, so you need `k - 1` additional sticks.\n   - To obtain `k` coals, you need `k * y` sticks (since each coal requires `y` sticks).\n   - The total number of sticks needed is `k - 1 + k * y`.\n\n2. **Calculating the Number of Trades**:\n   - The number of trades needed to acquire the required sticks is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{trades\\_for\\_sticks} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{total\\_sticks\\_needed} + (x - 1)}{x}\\right)\n     \\]\n   - The number of trades for coals is simply `k`.\n\n3. **Final Calculation**:\n   - The total number of trades is the sum of the trades for sticks and the trades for coals.\n\n### Revised Code:\nHere\u2019s the corrected version of the code that accurately calculates the minimum number of trades required:\n\n```python\ndef minimum_trades(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(t):\n        # Read x, y, k for the current test case\n        x, y, k = test_cases[i]\n        \n        # Calculate the total number of sticks needed\n        total_sticks_needed = (k * y) + (k - 1)  # k * y for coals + (k - 1) for additional sticks\n        \n        # Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required sticks\n        trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed + (x - 1)) // x\n        \n        # Each torch requires one coal, so we need k trades for coals\n        trades_for_coals = k\n        \n        # Total trades is the sum of trades for sticks and trades for coals\n        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + trades_for_coals\n        \n        # Store the result for this test case\n        results.append(total_trades)\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Main function to handle input and output\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    t = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n    test_cases = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, t + 1):\n        x, y, k = map(int, data[i].split())\n        test_cases.append((x, y, k))\n    \n    minimum_trades(t, test_cases)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- The `minimum_trades` function processes each test case to calculate the minimum number of trades required.\n- The main block reads all input at once, splits it into lines, and processes each test case.\n- The results are printed directly after processing all test cases, ensuring the output format matches the requirements.\n\nThis code should now work correctly and pass all tests as specified in the problem statement.",
