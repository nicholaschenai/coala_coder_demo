INFO - [Task id] 318 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a circular array representing pizza slices, where each slice has a certain size. You and two friends will take turns picking slices. You can pick any slice first, then your friend Alice will pick the next slice in the anti-clockwise direction, and Bob will pick the next slice in the clockwise direction. This continues until all slices are taken. The goal is to maximize the total size of the slices you pick.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to consider the circular nature of the array. We can break the problem into two cases: one where we include the first slice and one where we exclude it. For each case, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum sum of slices we can collect. We will iterate through the slices, updating our maximum sums based on the choices made by Alice and Bob.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function maxSizeSlices(slices):
       n = length of slices / 3
       max_sum = 0
       
       for i from 0 to 2:
           if i == 0:
               # Case 1: Include the first slice
               dp = array of size (n+1) x (length of slices - 1)
               for j from 0 to length of slices - 2:
                   update dp based on choices
           else:
               # Case 2: Exclude the first slice
               dp = array of size (n+1) x (length of slices - 1)
               for j from 1 to length of slices - 1:
                   update dp based on choices
       
       return max of the two cases
   ```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to solve a problem involving the combination of rocks with positive integer weights, where the goal was to determine the smallest possible weight of the remaining rock after performing a series of smash operations. The problem can be conceptualized as a variation of the subset sum problem, where the objective is to find the closest weight to half of the total weight of the rocks.

    The solution involved using dynamic programming to track achievable weights. I created a DP array to represent whether a certain weight could be formed using the available rocks. The approach was to iterate through each rock and update the DP array accordingly. Finally, I searched for the largest achievable weight close to half of the total weight, which allowed me to compute the minimum possible weight of the last remaining rock.

    The final implementation was successful, passing all test cases, including the provided example. The key takeaway from this experience is the effectiveness of dynamic programming in solving subset-related problems, particularly when dealing with combinations and weights. The solution was efficient and straightforward, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's requirements and constraints. 

    Here is the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
            total_weight = sum(stones)
            target = total_weight // 2
            dp = [False] * (target + 1)
            dp[0] = True
        
            for stone in stones:
                for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):
                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]
        
            for j in range(target, -1, -1):
                if dp[j]:
                    return total_weight - 2 * j
    ```
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 318 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We have a circular array of pizza slices, and we want to maximize the total size of the slices we can take. We can take one slice, and then our friends Alice and Bob will take slices in opposite directions. We need to find the best strategy to choose our slices to maximize our total.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will consider two scenarios: one where we include the first slice and one where we exclude it. For each scenario, we will calculate the maximum sum we can achieve by picking slices while ensuring that Alice and Bob take their slices in the correct order. We will keep track of the maximum sum we can achieve for each scenario and return the maximum of the two.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function maxSizeSlices(slices):
       n = length of slices
       k = n / 3
       
       // Define a helper function to calculate max sum
       function calculateMaxSum(slices, start, end, k):
           dp = array of size (k + 1) x (end - start + 1) initialized to 0

INFO - [Task id] 318 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We have a circular array of pizza slices, and we want to maximize the total size of the slices we can take. We can take one slice, and then our friends Alice and Bob will take slices in opposite directions. We need to find the best strategy to choose our slices to maximize our total.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will consider two scenarios: one where we include the first slice and one where we exclude it. For each scenario, we will calculate the maximum sum we can achieve by picking slices while ensuring that Alice and Bob take their slices in the correct order. We will keep track of the maximum sum we can achieve for each scenario and return the maximum of the two.

   ```
   function maxSizeSlices(slices):
       n = length of slices
       k = n / 3

INFO - [Task id] 318 [generation text] In this task, I was required to solve a problem involving maximizing the sum of pizza slice sizes taken from a circular array. The key concepts involved dynamic programming and handling circular arrays, which required careful consideration of slice selection based on the rules of picking slices in alternating directions.

The solution involved creating a helper function to calculate the maximum sum of slices based on two scenarios: one where the first slice is included and one where it is excluded. The dynamic programming approach utilized a 2D array to keep track of the maximum sums achievable for different numbers of slices taken. This method effectively handled the constraints of the problem, ensuring that the selections adhered to the rules of the game.

The final implementation successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was sound. The main takeaway from this experience is the importance of considering edge cases in circular arrays and the effectiveness of dynamic programming in optimizing selection problems. The solution was structured clearly, with a focus on modularity through the use of helper functions.

    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
class Solution:
    def maxSizeSlices(self, slices: List[int]) -> int:
        a,b,n=[slices[0]],[0],len(slices)
        for i in range(1,n):
            a.append(max(a[-1],slices[i]))
            b.append(max(b[-1],slices[i]))
        for i in range(2,2*n//3,2):
            aa,bb=[0]*(n-1),[0]*n
            for j in range(i,n-1): aa[j]=max(aa[j-1],a[j-2]+slices[j])
            for j in range(i+1,n): bb[j]=max(bb[j-1],b[j-2]+slices[j])
            a,b=aa,bb
        return max(a[-1],b[-1])

INFO - [Task id] 318 [generation text] The official solution employs a dynamic programming approach that efficiently calculates the maximum sum of pizza slices while considering the constraints of the problem. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Initialization**: The solution initializes two lists, `a` and `b`, to keep track of the maximum sums possible when including or excluding certain slices. The first element of `a` is set to the first slice, while `b` starts with zeros.

2. **First Pass**: The first loop iterates through the slices, updating `a` to store the maximum value up to each slice. This helps in determining the best possible slice to take at each step.

3. **Dynamic Programming Update**: The second loop iterates through potential slice counts (up to two-thirds of the total slices). For each count, it creates two new lists, `aa` and `bb`, to calculate the maximum sums based on previous values in `a` and `b`. This is done by considering whether to take the current slice or not, ensuring that the constraints of the problem are respected.

4. **Final Calculation**: After processing all slices, the maximum value from the last elements of `a` and `b` is returned, which represents the maximum sum of slices that can be taken.

The official solution is more concise and effectively handles the constraints of the problem by using a single pass to build up the maximum sums, rather than recalculating for each possible slice selection. This results in improved time complexity and clarity in the approach. 

In contrast, my initial solution was more verbose and involved a separate function for calculating maximum sums, which could lead to unnecessary complexity. The official solution's approach of maintaining and updating lists directly is more efficient and straightforward.
