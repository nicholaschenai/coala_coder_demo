st.pop();\n        int l = st.top(); st.pop();\n        switch (op) {\n            case '+': st.push(l + r); break;\n            case '-': st.push(l - r); break;\n            case '*': st.push(l * r); break;\n            case '/': st.push(l / r); break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    int evaluate(string& s) {\n        stack<int> st;\n        stack<char> op;\n        for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); i++) {\n            if (delim(s[i]))\n                continue;\n        \n            if (s[i] == '(') {\n                op.push('(');\n            } else if (s[i] == ')') {\n                while (op.top() != '(') {\n                    process_op(st, op.top());\n                    op.pop();\n                }\n                op.pop();\n            } else if (is_op(s[i])) {\n                char cur_op = s[i];\n                while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) {\n                    process_op(st, op.top());\n                    op.pop();\n                }\n                op.push(cur_op);\n            } else {\n                int number = 0;\n                while (i < (int)s.size() && isalnum(s[i]))\n                    number = number * 10 + s[i++] - '0';\n                --i;\n                st.push(number);\n            }\n        }\n\n        while (!op.empty()) {\n            process_op(st, op.top());\n            op.pop();\n        }\n        return st.top();\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Thus we learned how to calculate the value of an expression in $O(n)$, at the same time we implicitly used the reverse Polish notation.\n    By slightly modifying the above implementation it is also possible to obtain the expression in reverse Polish notation in an explicit form.\n\n    ## Unary operators\n\n    Now suppose that the expression also contains **unary** operators (operators that take one argument).\n    The unary plus and unary minus are common examples of such operators.\n\n    One of the differences in this case, is that we need to determine whether the current operator is a unary or a binary one.\n\n    You can notice, that before an unary operator, there always is another operator or an opening parenthesis, or nothing at all (if it is at the very beginning of the expression).\n    On the contrary before a binary operator there will always be an operand (number) or a closing parenthesis.\n    Thus it is easy to flag whether the next operator can be unary or not. \n\n    Additionally we need to execute a unary and a binary operator differently.\n    And we need to chose the priority of a unary operator higher than all of the binary operators.\n\n    In addition it should be noted, that some unary operators (e.g. unary plus and unary minus) are actually **right-associative**.\n\n    ## Right-associativity\n\n    Right-associative means, that whenever the priorities are equal, the operators must be evaluated from right to left.\n\n    As noted above, unary operators are usually right-associative.\n    Another example for an right-associative operator is the exponentiation operator ($a \\wedge b \\wedge c$ is usually perceived as $a^{b^c}$ and not as $(a^b)^c$).\n\n    What difference do we need to make in order to correctly handle right-associative operators?\n    It turns out that the changes are very minimal.\n    The only difference will be, if the priorities are equal we will postpone the execution of the right-associative operation.\n\n    The only line that needs to be replaced is\n    ```cpp\n    while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op))\n    ```\n    with\n    ```cpp\n    while (!op.empty() && (\n            (left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) ||\n            (!left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) > priority(cur_op))\n        ))\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

        "content": "The official solution provides a more streamlined approach to evaluating the expression string compared to my initial implementation. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Single Pass Evaluation**: The official solution processes the string in a single pass, maintaining a running total (`res`), the current number being processed (`num`), and the current sign (`sign`). This reduces the complexity of managing multiple stacks and simplifies the logic.\n\n2. **Handling Digits**: The solution efficiently constructs multi-digit numbers by multiplying the current number by 10 and adding the new digit, which is derived from the ASCII value of the character. This avoids the need for a separate parsing loop for numbers.\n\n3. **Sign Management**: The solution updates the result based on the current sign whenever it encounters a '+' or '-'. This is done immediately, which simplifies the logic and reduces the need for additional operations later.\n\n4. **Parentheses Handling**: When encountering an opening parenthesis '(', the current result and sign are pushed onto a stack. Upon encountering a closing parenthesis ')', the solution pops the sign and the result from the stack, allowing it to correctly compute the result of the expression within the parentheses.\n\n5. **Final Adjustment**: After processing the entire string, if there is any remaining number, it is added to the result, ensuring that all parts of the expression are accounted for.\n\nOverall, the official solution is more efficient and easier to follow, as it avoids the complexity of managing two stacks and instead uses a single stack for intermediate results. This approach also minimizes the number of operations needed to evaluate the expression, leading to better performance. \n\nIn future implementations, I will consider using a similar single-pass approach with clear state management for handling numbers, signs, and parentheses, as it leads to cleaner and more efficient code."

        "content": "\n[description]\nThis function evaluates a mathematical expression represented as a string, handling addition, subtraction, and parentheses. It uses two stacks: one for numbers and another for operators, processing the input string character by character. When encountering digits, it constructs the full number and pushes it onto the number stack. For operators, it applies the appropriate operations based on their precedence and manages parentheses by evaluating expressions within them. After processing the entire string, it applies any remaining operations in the stacks. Finally, it returns the result of the evaluated expression as an integer.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to evaluate mathematical expressions programmatically, such as in building a calculator application, parsing expressions in compilers, or implementing features in software that require arithmetic evaluations. It can also be applied in educational tools that help users understand the order of operations and expression evaluation. Additionally, this approach can be beneficial in data processing tasks where expressions need to be evaluated from user input or configuration files."
