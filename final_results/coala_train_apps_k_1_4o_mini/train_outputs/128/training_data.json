    "summary": "In this task, I implemented a basic calculator to evaluate simple mathematical expressions given as strings. The core concepts involved parsing the expression while handling numbers, operators, and parentheses. I utilized two stacks: one for numbers and another for operators, which allowed me to manage the order of operations effectively.\n\nThe strategy involved iterating through the characters of the input string, parsing numbers, and managing operator precedence using a helper function for precedence. When encountering parentheses, I ensured that calculations were performed correctly by popping from the stacks until the matching parenthesis was found. This approach successfully handled various expressions, including those with nested parentheses.\n\nThe final implementation was straightforward and passed the provided test cases. The key takeaway was the importance of using stacks to manage operations and the need to carefully handle operator precedence and parentheses in mathematical expressions. The solution was efficient and adhered to the constraints of not using any external libraries or the eval function.",
    "reflection": "The official solution provides a more streamlined approach to evaluating the expression string compared to my initial implementation. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Single Pass Evaluation**: The official solution processes the string in a single pass, maintaining a running total (`res`), the current number being processed (`num`), and the current sign (`sign`). This reduces the complexity of managing multiple stacks and simplifies the logic.\n\n2. **Handling Digits**: The solution efficiently constructs multi-digit numbers by multiplying the current number by 10 and adding the new digit, which is derived from the ASCII value of the character. This avoids the need for a separate parsing loop for numbers.\n\n3. **Sign Management**: The solution updates the result based on the current sign whenever it encounters a '+' or '-'. This is done immediately, which simplifies the logic and reduces the need for additional operations later.\n\n4. **Parentheses Handling**: When encountering an opening parenthesis '(', the current result and sign are pushed onto a stack. Upon encountering a closing parenthesis ')', the solution pops the sign and the result from the stack, allowing it to correctly compute the result of the expression within the parentheses.\n\n5. **Final Adjustment**: After processing the entire string, if there is any remaining number, it is added to the result, ensuring that all parts of the expression are accounted for.\n\nOverall, the official solution is more efficient and easier to follow, as it avoids the complexity of managing two stacks and instead uses a single stack for intermediate results. This approach also minimizes the number of operations needed to evaluate the expression, leading to better performance. \n\nIn future implementations, I will consider using a similar single-pass approach with clear state management for handling numbers, signs, and parentheses, as it leads to cleaner and more efficient code.",
    "desc": "\n[description]\nThis function evaluates a mathematical expression represented as a string, handling addition, subtraction, and parentheses. It uses two stacks: one for numbers and another for operators, processing the input string character by character. When encountering digits, it constructs the full number and pushes it onto the number stack. For operators, it applies the appropriate operations based on their precedence and manages parentheses by evaluating expressions within them. After processing the entire string, it applies any remaining operations in the stacks. Finally, it returns the result of the evaluated expression as an integer.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to evaluate mathematical expressions programmatically, such as in building a calculator application, parsing expressions in compilers, or implementing features in software that require arithmetic evaluations. It can also be applied in educational tools that help users understand the order of operations and expression evaluation. Additionally, this approach can be beneficial in data processing tasks where expressions need to be evaluated from user input or configuration files."
