    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a basic calculator that can evaluate simple mathematical expressions given as strings. These expressions can include numbers, addition and subtraction operators, parentheses, and spaces. The calculator should return the result of the expression as an integer.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To evaluate the expression, we can use two stacks: one for numbers and another for operators. We will iterate through the characters in the string:\n   - If we encounter a number, we will parse it and push it onto the number stack.\n   - If we encounter an operator (+ or -), we will check the operator stack to see if we need to perform any calculations based on the operator precedence.\n   - If we encounter an opening parenthesis, we will push it onto the operator stack.\n   - If we encounter a closing parenthesis, we will pop from the operator stack and perform calculations until we reach the corresponding opening parenthesis.\n   After processing the entire string, we will perform any remaining operations in the operator stack.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function calculate(expression):\n       initialize number_stack\n       initialize operator_stack\n       initialize index to 0\n       \n       while index < length of expression:\n           if current character is a space:\n               continue\n           if current character is a digit:\n               parse the full number and push it onto number_stack\n           if current character is '(':\n               push '(' onto operator_stack\n           if current character is ')':\n               while top of operator_stack is not '(':\n                   pop operator and two numbers, perform operation, push result onto number_stack\n               pop '(' from operator_stack\n           if current character is '+' or '-':\n               while operator_stack is not empty and precedence of top operator >= precedence of current operator:\n                   pop operator and two numbers, perform operation, push result onto number_stack\n               push current operator onto operator_stack\n           increment index\n       \n       while operator_stack is not empty:\n           pop operator and two numbers, perform operation, push result onto number_stack\n       \n       return top of number_stack\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:\n        def precedence(op):\n            if op == '+' or op == '-':\n                return 1\n            return 0\n\n        def apply_operation(a, b, op):\n            if op == '+':\n                return a + b\n            elif op == '-':\n                return a - b\n\n        number_stack = []\n        operator_stack = []\n        index = 0\n        n = len(s)\n\n        while index < n:\n            if s[index] == ' ':\n                index += 1\n                continue\n            \n            if s[index].isdigit():\n                num = 0\n                while index < n and s[index].isdigit():\n                    num = num * 10 + int(s[index])\n                    index += 1\n                number_stack.append(num)\n                continue\n            \n            if s[index] == '(':\n                operator_stack.append(s[index])\n            \n            elif s[index] == ')':\n                while operator_stack and operator_stack[-1] != '(':\n                    right = number_stack.pop()\n                    left = number_stack.pop()\n                    op = operator_stack.pop()\n                    number_stack.append(apply_operation(left, right, op))\n                operator_stack.pop()  # pop the '('\n            \n            elif s[index] in '+-':\n                while (operator_stack and precedence(operator_stack[-1]) >= precedence(s[index])):\n                    right = number_stack.pop()\n                    left = number_stack.pop()\n                    op = operator_stack.pop()\n                    number_stack.append(apply_operation(left, right, op))\n                operator_stack.append(s[index])\n            \n            index += 1\n\n        while operator_stack:\n            right = number_stack.pop()\n            left = number_stack.pop()\n            op = operator_stack.pop()\n            number_stack.append(apply_operation(left, right, op))\n\n        return number_stack[0]\n```",
