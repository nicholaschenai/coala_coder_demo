INFO - [Task id] 128 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a basic calculator that can evaluate simple mathematical expressions. These expressions can include numbers, addition and subtraction operations, parentheses for grouping, and spaces that should be ignored. The output should be the result of the evaluated expression.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a stack to handle the parentheses and the order of operations. We will iterate through the characters in the string, keeping track of the current number and the current operation (addition or subtraction). When we encounter a number, we will build it up until we hit a non-digit character. When we hit an operator or a parenthesis, we will process the current number based on the last operation we saw. If we encounter a closing parenthesis, we will pop from the stack until we find the corresponding opening parenthesis, summing the values as we go.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function calculate(s):
       initialize a stack
       initialize current number as 0
       initialize current operation as '+'
       initialize result as 0

       for each character in s:
           if character is a digit:
               build the current number
           if character is an operator or a parenthesis:
               process the current number based on the last operation
               reset current number
               update current operation
           if character is a closing parenthesis:
               process until the matching opening parenthesis
       
       return the final result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python

    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:

    Title: Expression parsing
    Part: 1/2
    # Expression parsing

    A string containing a mathematical expression containing numbers and various operators is given.
    We have to compute the value of it in $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string.

    The algorithm discussed here translates an expression into the so-called **reverse Polish notation** (explicitly or implicitly), and evaluates this expression.

    ## Reverse Polish notation

    The reverse Polish notation is a form of writing mathematical expressions, in which the operators are located after their operands.
    For example the following expression

    $$a + b * c * d + (e - f) * (g * h + i)$$

    can be written in reverse Polish notation in the following way:

    $$a b c * d * + e f - g h * i + * +$$

    The reverse Polish notation was developed by the Australian philosopher and computer science specialist Charles Hamblin in the mid 1950s on the basis of the Polish notation, which was proposed in 1920 by the Polish mathematician Jan Łukasiewicz.

    The convenience of the reverse Polish notation is, that expressions in this form are very **easy to evaluate** in linear time.
    We use a stack, which is initially empty.
    We will iterate over the operands and operators of the expression in reverse Polish notation.
    If the current element is a number, then we put the value on top of the stack, if the current element is an operator, then we get the top two elements from the stack, perform the operation, and put the result back on top of the stack.
    In the end there will be exactly one element left in the stack, which will be the value of the expression.

    Obviously this simple evaluation runs in $O(n)$ time.

    ## Parsing of simple expressions

    For the time being we only consider a simplified problem:
    we assume that all operators are **binary** (i.e. they take two arguments), and all are **left-associative** (if the priorities are equal, they get executed from left to right).
    Parentheses are allowed.

    We will set up two stacks: one for numbers, and one for operators and parentheses.
    Initially both stacks are empty.
    For the second stack we will maintain the condition that all operations are ordered by strict descending priority.
    If there are parenthesis on the stack, than each block of operators (corresponding to one pair of parenthesis) is ordered, and the entire stack is not necessarily ordered.

    We will iterate over the characters of the expression from left to right.
    If the current character is a digit, then we put the value of this number on the stack.
    If the current character is an opening parenthesis, then we put it on the stack.
    If the current character is a closing parenthesis, the we execute all operators on the stack until we reach the opening bracket (in other words we perform all operations inside the parenthesis).
    Finally if the current character is an operator, then while the top of the stack has an operator with the same or higher priority, we will execute this operation, and put the new operation on the stack.

    After we processed the entire string, some operators might still be in the stack, so we execute them.

    Here is the implementation of this method for the four operators $+$ $-$ $*$ $/$:

    ```{.cpp file=expression_parsing_simple}
    bool delim(char c) {
        return c == ' ';
    }

    bool is_op(char c) {
        return c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*' || c == '/';
    }

    int priority (char op) {
        if (op == '+' || op == '-')
            return 1;
        if (op == '*' || op == '/')
            return 2;
        return -1;
    }

    void process_op(stack<int>& st, char op) {
        int r = st.top(); st.pop();
        int l = st.top(); st.pop();
        switch (op) {
            case '+': st.push(l + r); break;
            case '-': st.push(l - r); break;
            case '*': st.push(l * r); break;
            case '/': st.push(l / r); break;
        }
    }

    int evaluate(string& s) {
        stack<int> st;
        stack<char> op;
        for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); i++) {
            if (delim(s[i]))
                continue;
        
            if (s[i] == '(') {
                op.push('(');
            } else if (s[i] == ')') {
                while (op.top() != '(') {
                    process_op(st, op.top());
                    op.pop();
                }
                op.pop();
            } else if (is_op(s[i])) {
                char cur_op = s[i];
                while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) {
                    process_op(st, op.top());
                    op.pop();
                }
                op.push(cur_op);
            } else {
                int number = 0;
                while (i < (int)s.size() && isalnum(s[i]))
                    number = number * 10 + s[i++] - '0';
                --i;
                st.push(number);
            }
        }

        while (!op.empty()) {
            process_op(st, op.top());
            op.pop();
        }
        return st.top();
    }
    ```

    Thus we learned how to calculate the value of an expression in $O(n)$, at the same time we implicitly used the reverse Polish notation.
    By slightly modifying the above implementation it is also possible to obtain the expression in reverse Polish notation in an explicit form.

    ## Unary operators

    Now suppose that the expression also contains **unary** operators (operators that take one argument).
    The unary plus and unary minus are common examples of such operators.

    One of the differences in this case, is that we need to determine whether the current operator is a unary or a binary one.

    You can notice, that before an unary operator, there always is another operator or an opening parenthesis, or nothing at all (if it is at the very beginning of the expression).
    On the contrary before a binary operator there will always be an operand (number) or a closing parenthesis.
    Thus it is easy to flag whether the next operator can be unary or not. 

    Additionally we need to execute a unary and a binary operator differently.
    And we need to chose the priority of a unary operator higher than all of the binary operators.

    In addition it should be noted, that some unary operators (e.g. unary plus and unary minus) are actually **right-associative**.

    ## Right-associativity

    Right-associative means, that whenever the priorities are equal, the operators must be evaluated from right to left.

    As noted above, unary operators are usually right-associative.
    Another example for an right-associative operator is the exponentiation operator ($a \wedge b \wedge c$ is usually perceived as $a^{b^c}$ and not as $(a^b)^c$).

    What difference do we need to make in order to correctly handle right-associative operators?
    It turns out that the changes are very minimal.
    The only difference will be, if the priorities are equal we will postpone the execution of the right-associative operation.

    The only line that needs to be replaced is
    ```cpp
    while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op))
    ```
    with
    ```cpp
    while (!op.empty() && (
            (left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) ||
            (!left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) > priority(cur_op))
        ))

INFO - [Task id] 128 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a basic calculator that can evaluate simple mathematical expressions given as strings. These expressions can include numbers, addition and subtraction operators, parentheses, and spaces. The calculator should return the result of the expression as an integer.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To evaluate the expression, we can use two stacks: one for numbers and another for operators. We will iterate through the characters in the string:
   - If we encounter a number, we will parse it and push it onto the number stack.
   - If we encounter an operator (+ or -), we will check the operator stack to see if we need to perform any calculations based on the operator precedence.
   - If we encounter an opening parenthesis, we will push it onto the operator stack.
   - If we encounter a closing parenthesis, we will pop from the operator stack and perform calculations until we reach the corresponding opening parenthesis.
   After processing the entire string, we will perform any remaining operations in the operator stack.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function calculate(expression):
       initialize number_stack
       initialize operator_stack
       initialize index to 0
       
       while index < length of expression:
           if current character is a space:
               continue
           if current character is a digit:
               parse the full number and push it onto number_stack
           if current character is '(':
               push '(' onto operator_stack
           if current character is ')':
               while top of operator_stack is not '(':
                   pop operator and two numbers, perform operation, push result onto number_stack
               pop '(' from operator_stack
           if current character is '+' or '-':
               while operator_stack is not empty and precedence of top operator >= precedence of current operator:
                   pop operator and two numbers, perform operation, push result onto number_stack
               push current operator onto operator_stack
           increment index
       
       while operator_stack is not empty:
           pop operator and two numbers, perform operation, push result onto number_stack
       
       return top of number_stack

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a basic calculator that can evaluate simple mathematical expressions given as strings. These expressions can include numbers, addition and subtraction operators, parentheses, and spaces. The calculator should return the result of the expression as an integer.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To evaluate the expression, we can use two stacks: one for numbers and another for operators. We will iterate through the characters in the string:
   - If we encounter a number, we will parse it and push it onto the number stack.
   - If we encounter an operator (+ or -), we will check the operator stack to see if we need to perform any calculations based on the operator precedence.
   - If we encounter an opening parenthesis, we will push it onto the operator stack.
   - If we encounter a closing parenthesis, we will pop from the operator stack and perform calculations until we reach the corresponding opening parenthesis.
   After processing the entire string, we will perform any remaining operations in the operator stack.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function calculate(expression):
       initialize number_stack
       initialize operator_stack
       initialize index to 0
       
       while index < length of expression:
           if current character is a space:
               continue
           if current character is a digit:
               parse the full number and push it onto number_stack
           if current character is '(':
               push '(' onto operator_stack
           if current character is ')':
               while top of operator_stack is not '(':
                   pop operator and two numbers, perform operation, push result onto number_stack
               pop '(' from operator_stack
           if current character is '+' or '-':
               while operator_stack is not empty and precedence of top operator >= precedence of current operator:
                   pop operator and two numbers, perform operation, push result onto number_stack
               push current operator onto operator_stack
           increment index
       
       while operator_stack is not empty:
           pop operator and two numbers, perform operation, push result onto number_stack
       
       return top of number_stack

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 128 [generation text] In this task, I implemented a basic calculator to evaluate simple mathematical expressions given as strings. The core concepts involved parsing the expression while handling numbers, operators, and parentheses. I utilized two stacks: one for numbers and another for operators, which allowed me to manage the order of operations effectively.

The strategy involved iterating through the characters of the input string, parsing numbers, and managing operator precedence using a helper function for precedence. When encountering parentheses, I ensured that calculations were performed correctly by popping from the stacks until the matching parenthesis was found. This approach successfully handled various expressions, including those with nested parentheses.

The final implementation was straightforward and passed the provided test cases. The key takeaway was the importance of using stacks to manage operations and the need to carefully handle operator precedence and parentheses in mathematical expressions. The solution was efficient and adhered to the constraints of not using any external libraries or the eval function.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 128 [generation text] The official solution provides a more streamlined approach to evaluating the expression string compared to my initial implementation. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Single Pass Evaluation**: The official solution processes the string in a single pass, maintaining a running total (`res`), the current number being processed (`num`), and the current sign (`sign`). This reduces the complexity of managing multiple stacks and simplifies the logic.

2. **Handling Digits**: The solution efficiently constructs multi-digit numbers by multiplying the current number by 10 and adding the new digit, which is derived from the ASCII value of the character. This avoids the need for a separate parsing loop for numbers.

3. **Sign Management**: The solution updates the result based on the current sign whenever it encounters a '+' or '-'. This is done immediately, which simplifies the logic and reduces the need for additional operations later.

4. **Parentheses Handling**: When encountering an opening parenthesis '(', the current result and sign are pushed onto a stack. Upon encountering a closing parenthesis ')', the solution pops the sign and the result from the stack, allowing it to correctly compute the result of the expression within the parentheses.

5. **Final Adjustment**: After processing the entire string, if there is any remaining number, it is added to the result, ensuring that all parts of the expression are accounted for.

Overall, the official solution is more efficient and easier to follow, as it avoids the complexity of managing two stacks and instead uses a single stack for intermediate results. This approach also minimizes the number of operations needed to evaluate the expression, leading to better performance. 

In future implementations, I will consider using a similar single-pass approach with clear state management for handling numbers, signs, and parentheses, as it leads to cleaner and more efficient code.
