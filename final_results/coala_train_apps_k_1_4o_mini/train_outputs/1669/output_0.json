    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   Alice has a collection of cards represented as an array of integers. She wants to rearrange these cards into groups of size W, where each group consists of W consecutive integers. The task is to determine if it is possible to rearrange the cards in such a way.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - First, check if the total number of cards is divisible by W. If not, it's impossible to form groups of size W.\n   - Next, sort the array of cards. This will help us easily find consecutive sequences.\n   - Use a frequency counter to keep track of how many of each card we have.\n   - Iterate through the sorted unique cards and try to form groups of W consecutive cards. For each card, check if we can form a complete group using the available cards in the frequency counter.\n   - If we can form all groups successfully, return true; otherwise, return false.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function isNStraightHand(hand, W):\n       if length of hand is not divisible by W:\n           return false\n       \n       sort hand\n       create a frequency counter for hand\n       \n       for each card in sorted unique hand:\n           while frequency of card is greater than 0:\n               for i from 0 to W-1:\n                   if frequency of (card + i) is 0:\n                       return false\n                   decrease frequency of (card + i) by 1\n       \n       return true\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def isNStraightHand(self, hand: List[int], W: int) -> bool:\n        # Step 1: Check if the total number of cards is divisible by W\n        if len(hand) % W != 0:\n            return False\n        \n        # Step 2: Sort the hand to facilitate grouping\n        hand.sort()\n        \n        # Step 3: Create a frequency counter for the cards\n        frequency = {}\n        for card in hand:\n            if card in frequency:\n                frequency[card] += 1\n            else:\n                frequency[card] = 1\n        \n        # Step 4: Try to form groups of W consecutive cards\n        for card in sorted(frequency.keys()):\n            while frequency[card] > 0:\n                # Attempt to form a group starting with 'card'\n                for i in range(W):\n                    if frequency.get(card + i, 0) <= 0:\n                        return False\n                    frequency[card + i] -= 1\n        \n        # If all groups are formed successfully, return true\n        return True\n```",
