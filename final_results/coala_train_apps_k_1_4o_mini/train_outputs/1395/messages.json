The key insight was recognizing that the maximum reduction possible is the sum of the first N natural numbers, which can be calculated using the formula \\(N \\times (N + 1) / 2\\).\n\n    Initially, the solution incorrectly handled the conditions for determining if the sequence could be made \"good.\" The logic needed to explicitly check if the total sum was zero, if it was positive and could be reduced to zero, or if it was negative, which would immediately result in \"NO.\" \n\n    The final working solution iterates through each test case, calculates the total sum and maximum reduction, and checks the conditions correctly.

If `A` is equal to `B`, the result of `A^B` will be `0`, which is a concise way to determine if they can cheat infinitely. This is a clever use of bitwise operations that simplifies the equality check.\n\n2. **Divisor Counting**: The solution counts the divisors of the absolute difference between `A` and `B` using a loop that runs up to the square root of the difference. This is efficient because divisors come in pairs, and checking up to the square root reduces the number of iterations significantly.\n\n3. **Handling Perfect Squares**: The solution correctly handles the case where the divisor is a perfect square by checking if `diff/i == i` to avoid double counting.\n\n4. **Output**: The solution prints `-1` for infinite cases and the count of divisors for other cases, which aligns with the problem requirements.\n\nOverall, the official solution is efficient and concise, utilizing bitwise operations and mathematical properties effectively.
