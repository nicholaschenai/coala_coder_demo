## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared $p$ different sets of questions (numbered $0$ through $p-1$), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:
- The students are assigned roll numbers â€” pairwise distinct positive integers.
- If a student's roll number is $r$, this student gets the $((r-1)\%p)$-th set of questions.
Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.
You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: $A$ and $B$ respectively. Find the number of values of $p$ for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line â€” the number of values of $p$ for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le A, B \le 10^8$

-----Example Input-----
1
2 6

-----Example Output-----
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: They can cheat for $p = 1$, $p = 2$ or $p = 4$.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Ram and Shyam have distinct roll numbers, and they receive different sets of questions based on their roll numbers. We need to determine how many different values of `p` (the number of question sets) allow them to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the values of `p` for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, we need to check when the modulo operation on their roll numbers results in the same value. This can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   (A - 1) \% p = (B - 1) \% p
   \]
   This can be simplified to:
   \[
   (A - B) \% p = 0
   \]
   This means that `p` must be a divisor of the absolute difference between `A` and `B`. If `A` equals `B`, they will always receive the same set of questions for any positive `p`, leading to an infinite number of values. If `A` is not equal to `B`, we can find the number of divisors of the absolute difference.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_divisors(n):
       count = 0
       for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
           if n % i == 0:
               count += 1
               if i != n / i:

           A, B = test_case

   ```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing elements based on their indices. The key insight was recognizing that the maximum reduction possible is the sum of the first N natural numbers, which can be calculated using the formula \(N \times (N + 1) / 2\).

    Initially, the solution incorrectly handled the conditions for determining if the sequence could be made "good." The logic needed to explicitly check if the total sum was zero, if it was positive and could be reduced to zero, or if it was negative, which would immediately result in "NO." 

    The final working solution iterates through each test case, calculates the total sum and maximum reduction, and checks the conditions correctly. The code snippet that encapsulates the solution is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            A = case[1]
            total_sum = sum(A)
            max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2
        
            if total_sum == 0:
                print("YES")
            elif total_sum > 0 and total_sum <= max_reduction:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all possible conditions and edge cases when solving problems involving sums and modifications of sequences.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Ram and Shyam have distinct roll numbers, and they receive exam question sets based on their roll numbers. We need to find out how many different numbers of question sets (denoted as `p`) would allow them to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such `p`, we should return `-1`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To determine when Ram and Shyam receive the same set of questions, we need to check when the modulo operation on their roll numbers results in the same value. This can be expressed mathematically as:

   This means that `p` must be a divisor of the absolute difference between their roll numbers, `|A - B|`. If `A` equals `B`, they will always receive the same set for any `p`, leading to infinite possibilities. Otherwise, we need to count the divisors of `|A - B|`.

   This means that `p` must be a divisor of the absolute difference between their roll numbers, `|A - B|`. If `A` equals `B`, they will always receive the same set for any `p`, leading to infinite possibilities. Otherwise, we need to count the divisors of `|A - B|`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_divisors(n):
       count = 0
       for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
           if n % i == 0:
               count += 1
               if i != n / i:
                   count += 1
       return count

   function main():
       read integer T
       for each test case:
           read integers A and B
           if A == B:
               print -1
           else:
               difference = abs(A - B)
               divisors_count = count_divisors(difference)
               print divisors_count
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

    # Initialize the count of divisors
    count = 0

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] The problem involved determining how many different values of `p` would allow two students, Ram and Shyam, to receive the same set of exam questions based on their roll numbers. The key insight was that this condition translates to finding the divisors of the absolute difference between their roll numbers, `|A - B|`. If their roll numbers are the same, there are infinitely many values of `p`, which is handled by returning `-1`.

The solution required implementing a function to count the divisors of a number efficiently by iterating up to its square root. This approach ensures that we account for both the divisor and its complement in the division. The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the provided test cases.

The final code effectively reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the correct number of divisors or `-1` when applicable. The solution was efficient and adhered to the constraints, demonstrating a solid understanding of modular arithmetic and divisor counting. 

Key code snippet for counting divisors:
```python
def count_divisors(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
    return count
``` 

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical properties related to divisors and modular arithmetic in problem-solving.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared $p$ different sets of questions (numbered $0$ through $p-1$), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:
- The students are assigned roll numbers â€” pairwise distinct positive integers.
- If a student's roll number is $r$, this student gets the $((r-1)\%p)$-th set of questions.
Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.
You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: $A$ and $B$ respectively. Find the number of values of $p$ for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line â€” the number of values of $p$ for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le A, B \le 10^8$

-----Example Input-----
1
2 6

-----Example Output-----
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: They can cheat for $p = 1$, $p = 2$ or $p = 4$.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Ram and Shyam have distinct roll numbers, and they receive exam question sets based on their roll numbers. We need to find out how many different numbers of question sets (denoted as `p`) would allow them to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such `p`, we should return `-1`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To determine when Ram and Shyam receive the same set of questions, we need to check when the modulo operation on their roll numbers results in the same value. This can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   (A - 1) \% p = (B - 1) \% p
   \]
   This simplifies to checking when:
   \[
   (A - B) \% p = 0
   \]
   This means that `p` must be a divisor of the absolute difference between their roll numbers, `|A - B|`. If `A` equals `B`, they will always receive the same set for any `p`, leading to infinite possibilities. Otherwise, we need to count the divisors of `|A - B|`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
# cook your dish here
for test in range(0,int(input())):
 A,B = map(int,input().split())
 diff = abs(A-B)
 count=0
 if not(A^B):
  print(-1)
 else:
  for i in range(1,int(diff**(1/2))+1):
   if diff%i==0:
    if diff/i==i:
     count+=1 
    else:
     count+=2
  print(count)

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem by leveraging the properties of divisors and the bitwise XOR operation to determine if the roll numbers are equal. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Equality Check with XOR**: The solution uses the expression `A^B` to check if `A` and `B` are equal. If `A` is equal to `B`, the result of `A^B` will be `0`, which is a concise way to determine if they can cheat infinitely. This is a clever use of bitwise operations that simplifies the equality check.

2. **Divisor Counting**: The solution counts the divisors of the absolute difference between `A` and `B` using a loop that runs up to the square root of the difference. This is efficient because divisors come in pairs, and checking up to the square root reduces the number of iterations significantly.

3. **Handling Perfect Squares**: The solution correctly handles the case where the divisor is a perfect square by checking if `diff/i == i` to avoid double counting.

4. **Output**: The solution prints `-1` for infinite cases and the count of divisors for other cases, which aligns with the problem requirements.

Overall, the official solution is efficient and concise, utilizing bitwise operations and mathematical properties effectively. My initial approach was similar but could have benefited from the XOR check for equality, which would have streamlined the logic. Additionally, the official solution's handling of perfect squares is a good reminder to consider edge cases in divisor counting.
