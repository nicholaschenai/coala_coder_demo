    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to compute the XOR pair representation (XPR) of a positive integer \\( N \\) and define functions \\( F(N) \\) and \\( G(L, R) \\). The function \\( F(N) \\) should return the maximum value of \\( B \\) such that \\( A \\oplus B = N \\) and \\( 1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq N \\). The function \\( G(L, R) \\) sums up \\( F(i) \\) for all integers \\( i \\) from \\( L \\) to \\( R \\).\n\nKey observations included the properties of XOR, where \\( B \\) can be computed directly as \\( B = A \\oplus N \\). The main challenge was ensuring that the conditions \\( A \\leq B \\leq N \\) were correctly implemented. \n\nThe initial attempts failed to produce the expected results due to incorrect handling of valid pairs and the logic for determining the maximum \\( B \\). The function \\( F(N) \\) was supposed to iterate through all possible values of \\( A \\) and check the validity of \\( B \\), but the implementation did not correctly account for all valid pairs.\n\nThe final implementation involved iterating through all values of \\( A \\) from 1 to \\( N \\), calculating \\( B \\), and checking the conditions. However, the results still did not match the expected outputs, indicating a deeper issue with the logic or approach.\n\n### Key Code Snippet:\n```python\ndef F(N):\n    max_B = -1\n    for A in range(1, N + 1):\n        B = A ^ N\n        if A <= B <= N:\n            max_B = max(max_B, B)\n    return max_B if max_B != -1 else -1\n\ndef G(L, R):\n    total_sum = 0\n    for i in range(L, R + 1):\n        F_value = F(i)\n        if F_value != -1:\n            total_sum += F_value\n    return total_sum\n```\n\n### Lessons Learned:\n- The importance of carefully validating conditions when working with bitwise operations.\n- The need to thoroughly test edge cases to ensure the logic holds across the entire range of inputs.\n- The realization that XOR properties can lead to non-intuitive results, requiring careful consideration of valid ranges.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\nIn my attempts to solve the problem of calculating the XOR pair representation (XPR) and the functions F(N) and G(L, R), I encountered several challenges that ultimately led to incorrect outputs. My approach involved iterating through all possible values of A for each N and calculating B using the XOR operation. However, this brute-force method proved inefficient, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as \\(10^9\\).\n\nThe official solution, on the other hand, employs a more mathematical approach that leverages properties of numbers and their binary representations. The key insights from the official solution include:\n\n1. **Mathematical Summation**: The solution calculates the sum of integers up to N using the formula \\((x \\times (x + 1)) // 2\\), which is efficient and avoids the need for iteration.\n  \n2. **Binary Representation**: The solution uses the concept of counting how many numbers can be formed with certain binary properties, which allows it to compute the required sums without explicitly iterating through all possible values.\n\n3. **Logarithmic Calculation**: The use of logarithms to determine the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial number helps in adjusting the final result efficiently.\n\n4. **Handling Ranges**: The solution effectively handles the range queries by computing the result for R and subtracting the result for \\(L-1\\), which simplifies the calculation for any given range.\n\n### Key Takeaways:\n- **Efficiency**: The official solution is significantly more efficient than my brute-force approach, especially for large inputs.\n- **Mathematical Insight**: Understanding the properties of numbers and their binary representations can lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.\n- **Range Queries**: Using cumulative properties (like prefix sums) can simplify the computation of results over ranges.\n\nIn future problem-solving scenarios, I will focus on exploring mathematical properties and optimizations rather than relying solely on brute-force methods, especially when dealing with large constraints.",
