The condition \\( A \\oplus B = N \\) implies that for each A, B must be calculated correctly.\n   - The maximum B should be updated correctly, but we need to ensure that we are not missing any valid pairs.\n   - The output values seem to be consistently higher than expected, indicating that the logic for determining valid pairs might be flawed.\n\n5. **Revisiting the Logic:**\n   - We need to ensure that we are correctly identifying the smallest A that gives us a valid B.\n   - We should also ensure that we are not skipping any valid pairs by checking all possible values of A and ensuring that we are correctly updating the maximum B.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n- We will iterate through all possible values of A and calculate B.\n- We will check if A is less than or equal to B and if B is within the range.\n- We will keep track of the maximum B found for each N.\n- If no valid pairs are found, we will return -1.\n\nNow, let's implement the corrected logic in the code.\n\n```python\ndef F(N):\n    max_B = -1  # Initialize max_B to -1 to track the maximum B found\n    for A in range(1, N + 1):  # Iterate A from 1 to N\n        B = A ^ N  # Calculate B using XOR\n        if A <= B <= N:  # Check if B is valid\n            max_B = max(max_B, B)  # Update max_B if we found a larger valid B\n    return max_B if max_B != -1 else -1  # Return max_B or -1 if no valid pair found\n\ndef G(L, R):\n    total_sum = 0  # Initialize total sum\n    for i in range(L, R + 1):  # Iterate from L to R\n        F_value = F(i)  # Get F(i)\n        if F_value != -1:  # Only add if F(i) is valid\n            total_sum += F_value  # Add F(i) to the total sum\n    return total_sum  # Return the total sum\n\n# Read number of test cases\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    L, R = map(int, input().split())  # Read L and R for each test case\n    print(G(L, R))  # Print the result of G(L, R)\n``` \n\nThis revised code should correctly compute the values of F(N) and subsequently G(L, R) for the given test cases."

The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. If no such permutation exists for the given N and K, we should return -1.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n           To solve this problem, we need to understand the maximum possible value of f(P) for a given N. The maximum value occurs when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the highest possible sums of adjacent maximums. The minimum value of f(P) is 0, which occurs when N is 1. We can derive the maximum value of f(P) as follows:\n           - For a permutation of size N, the maximum value of f(P) is calculated as:\n             - f(P) = (N) + (N-1) + ... + (2) = N * (N - 1) / 2\n           - If K is greater than this maximum value or less than 0, we return -1.\n           - If K is achievable, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to meet the exact value of K.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n           ```\n           function find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n               for each test_case in test_cases:\n                   N, K = test_case\n                   max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2\n                   if K > max_f or K < 0:\n                       print -1\n                   else:\n                       create a descending list from N to 1\n                       adjust the list to achieve the exact value of K\n                       print the permutation\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n        ```python\n        def find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n            results = []  # To store results for each test case\n            for case in test_cases:\n                N, K = case\n                max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum possible f(P)\n        \n                if K > max_f or K < 0:  # Check if K is out of bounds\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n                else:\n                    # Start with the descending permutation\n                    permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                    current_f = max_f  # Start with the maximum f(P)\n            \n                    # Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K\n                    for i in range(N - 1):\n                        if current_f == K:\n                            break\n                        # If we can reduce the current_f by 1, we swap elements\n                        if current_f > K:\n                            # Swap the last two elements to reduce the f(P) value\n                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                            current_f -= 1  # Decrease the f(P) value by 1\n            \n                    results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))  # Store the result as a string\n\n            # Print all results at once for efficiency\n            print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\n        # Read number of test cases\n        T = int(input())\n        test_cases = []\n\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, K = map(int, input().split())\n            test_cases.append((N, K))\n\n        find_permutation(T, test_cases)\n        ```\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n        None\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: ['3', '4 12', '2 2', '5 14'] Expected output: [{'-1'}, {'2', '1'}, {'2', '5', '1', '3', '4'}] # Execution output: ['-1', '-1', '-1']\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Failure\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
