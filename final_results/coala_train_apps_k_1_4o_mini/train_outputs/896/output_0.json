    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   Chef has a series of segments defined by their left and right endpoints. He wants to transform the first segment into the last one using a series of operations that shift the endpoints of the segments. The goal is to find the minimum number of operations needed to achieve this transformation, and if there are multiple ways to do it, we should choose the one that is lexicographically smallest.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - For each segment, calculate how many operations are needed to transform it into the next segment.\n   - The operations can be either increasing or decreasing the left or right endpoints.\n   - We will keep track of the total number of operations and the sequence of operations performed.\n   - We need to ensure that we do not create empty segments during the transformations.\n   - Finally, we will output the total number of operations and the sequence of operations for each test case.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function transform_segments(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read N\n           initialize segments list\n           for i from 1 to N:\n               read Li, Ri and append to segments list\n           \n           initialize total_operations to 0\n           initialize operations_sequence to empty string\n           \n           for i from 0 to N-2:\n               current_segment = segments[i]\n               next_segment = segments[i+1]\n               \n               calculate operations needed to transform current_segment to next_segment\n               update total_operations\n               update operations_sequence with the operations performed\n           \n           print total_operations\n           print operations_sequence\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef transform_segments(T, test_cases):\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N = case[0]  # Number of segments\n        segments = case[1]  # List of segments\n        \n        total_operations = 0  # To count total operations\n        operations_sequence = \"\"  # To store the sequence of operations\n        \n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            L1, R1 = segments[i]  # Current segment\n            L2, R2 = segments[i + 1]  # Next segment\n            \n            # Calculate the number of operations needed to transform [L1, R1] to [L2, R2]\n            while L1 < L2:\n                operations_sequence += \"L+\"\n                L1 += 1\n                total_operations += 1\n            while L1 > L2:\n                operations_sequence += \"L-\"\n                L1 -= 1\n                total_operations += 1\n            while R1 < R2:\n                operations_sequence += \"R+\"\n                R1 += 1\n                total_operations += 1\n            while R1 > R2:\n                operations_sequence += \"R-\"\n                R1 -= 1\n                total_operations += 1\n        \n        # Output the results for the current test case\n        print(total_operations)\n        print(operations_sequence)\n\n# Read input and prepare test cases\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())\n    segments = []\n    for _ in range(N):\n        L, R = map(int, input().split())\n        segments.append((L, R))\n    test_cases.append((N, segments))\n\n# Call the function with the prepared test cases\ntransform_segments(T, test_cases)\n```",
