The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.\nThe area is of dimension $N$ x $N$\nThe whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.\nThis is a SAFE example:\n1 0\n0 1\nThis is an UNSAFE example:\n0 1 1\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\nTo avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.\nReturn an output of \"SAFE\" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return \"UNSAFE\" otherwise.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- Next line contains $N$.\n- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is \"SAFE\" or \"UNSAFE\".

The area is represented as a grid of 1s and 0s, where 1 indicates a bed is present and 0 indicates it is not. The beds must not be adjacent to each other, meaning no two beds can be in horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent blocks.

If we find a bed (1), we will check its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) to see if any of them also contain a bed.

Each box `i` contains `i` tiles, and each room `i` requires `i*i` tiles to be completely tiled.\n\n    **Key Insights:**\n    1. The number of tiles in box `i` must be even to tile two rooms completely.\n    2. The area of the rooms corresponds to perfect squares, meaning we need to find the largest integer `k` such that `k^2 <= N`.\n    3. The total number of rooms that can be tiled is `2 * k`, as each perfect square can tile two rooms (one in each house).\n\n    **Mistakes Made:**\n    - Initially, I miscalculated the number of rooms that could be tiled by simply counting even boxes and multiplying by 2, which did not consider the actual area requirements of the rooms.\n    - I repeatedly returned `2 * k` without properly validating the conditions under which rooms could be tiled.\n\n    **Final Correct Approach:**\n    The correct solution involves calculating `k` as `int(N**0.5)` to find the largest perfect square less than or equal to `N`, and then returning `2 * k` for the total number of rooms that can be tiled.\n\n    **Final Code Snippet:**\n    ```python\n    def count_tiled_rooms(N):\n        k = int(N**0.5)  # Largest k such that k^2 <= N\n        return 2 * k  # Each k can tile two rooms\n\n    T = int(input())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        result = count_tiled_rooms(N)\n        print(result)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the problem constraints and requirements, particularly when dealing with mathematical relationships in programming challenges.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

If two adjacent beds are found, it marks the arrangement as \"UNSAFE\" and breaks out of the loop.\n\n4. **Column Check**: After checking rows, it checks each column for adjacent beds by comparing each element with the one directly below it. Again, if adjacent beds are found, it marks the arrangement as \"UNSAFE\".\n\n5. **Final Result**: If no adjacent beds are found after both checks, it appends \"SAFE\" to the results list.\n\n6. **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.\n\n### Key Takeaways:\n- The official solution is efficient in that it checks for adjacency in a straightforward manner, ensuring that it only traverses the grid a minimal number of times.\n- The separation of row and column checks simplifies the logic and makes it easier to understand.\n- The use of a flag to indicate whether an unsafe condition has been found allows for early termination of checks, which can save time in larger grids.\n\n### Reflection:\nMy initial approach was similar in logic but combined the checks into a single function, which could have made it less clear. The official solution's method of separating row and column checks is more intuitive and easier to follow. Additionally, the use of a flag for early exit is a good practice that I can incorporate into my future solutions to improve efficiency."

It iterates through each cell in the grid and, upon finding a bed, examines the four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) for additional beds. If any adjacent beds are found, it returns \"UNSAFE\". If no adjacent beds are detected after checking the entire grid, it returns \"SAFE\". This function is useful for ensuring that beds are arranged without being too close to one another. The output indicates the safety of the bed arrangement based on the adjacency criteria.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where social distancing is critical, such as during a pandemic or in crowded environments. It can be applied in hospital bed arrangements, event seating plans, or any situation where maintaining a safe distance between individuals is necessary. The algorithm can help quickly assess the safety of arrangements in various layouts, ensuring compliance with health guidelines."
