## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$
- 70 points : Original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----

0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1

1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0

-----Sample Output:-----
SAFE
UNSAFE

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to check if a given arrangement of beds in a square area is safe. The area is represented as a grid of 1s and 0s, where 1 indicates a bed is present and 0 indicates it is not. The beds must not be adjacent to each other, meaning no two beds can be in horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent blocks. If any two beds are adjacent, we will classify the arrangement as "UNSAFE"; otherwise, it will be "SAFE".

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   We will iterate through each test case and for each grid, we will check every cell. If we find a bed (1), we will check its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) to see if any of them also contain a bed. If we find any adjacent beds, we will mark the arrangement as "UNSAFE". If we finish checking the entire grid without finding any adjacent beds, we will mark it as "SAFE".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function check_beds_safety(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N
           create a grid of size N x N
           for each row in grid:
               read the row values
           is_safe = True

               for j from 0 to N-1:

                       check all adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, and diagonals)
                       if any adjacent cell is also 1:
                           is_safe = False

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0

0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

    ### Summary of Attempts

    The problem involved distributing tiles from boxes to tile rooms in two houses, ensuring that the same number of tiles from a box is used for two rooms. Each box `i` contains `i` tiles, and each room `i` requires `i*i` tiles to be completely tiled.

    **Key Insights:**
    1. The number of tiles in box `i` must be even to tile two rooms completely.
    2. The area of the rooms corresponds to perfect squares, meaning we need to find the largest integer `k` such that `k^2 <= N`.
    3. The total number of rooms that can be tiled is `2 * k`, as each perfect square can tile two rooms (one in each house).

    **Mistakes Made:**
    - Initially, I miscalculated the number of rooms that could be tiled by simply counting even boxes and multiplying by 2, which did not consider the actual area requirements of the rooms.
    - I repeatedly returned `2 * k` without properly validating the conditions under which rooms could be tiled.

    **Final Correct Approach:**
    The correct solution involves calculating `k` as `int(N**0.5)` to find the largest perfect square less than or equal to `N`, and then returning `2 * k` for the total number of rooms that can be tiled.

    **Final Code Snippet:**
    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(N):
        k = int(N**0.5)  # Largest k such that k^2 <= N
        return 2 * k  # Each k can tile two rooms

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        result = count_tiled_rooms(N)
        print(result)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully considering the problem constraints and requirements, particularly when dealing with mathematical relationships in programming challenges.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem involves checking a grid that represents a hospital area where beds are placed. Each cell in the grid can either have a bed (represented by `1`) or not (represented by `0`). The goal is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent to each other horizontally or vertically. Beds placed diagonally do not count as adjacent.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each test case and check the grid for any adjacent beds. For each bed found, we will check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) to see if they also contain a bed. If we find any adjacent beds, we will mark the arrangement as "UNSAFE". If we finish checking the entire grid without finding any adjacent beds, we will mark it as "SAFE".

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem involves checking a grid that represents a hospital area where beds are placed. Each cell in the grid can either have a bed (represented by `1`) or not (represented by `0`). The goal is to determine if the arrangement of beds is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". An arrangement is considered "SAFE" if no two beds are adjacent to each other horizontally or vertically. Beds placed diagonally do not count as adjacent.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each test case and check the grid for any adjacent beds. For each bed found, we will check its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) to see if they also contain a bed. If we find any adjacent beds, we will mark the arrangement as "UNSAFE". If we finish checking the entire grid without finding any adjacent beds, we will mark it as "SAFE".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function is_safe(arr, N):
       for i from 0 to N-1:
           for j from 0 to N-1:

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine if a grid representing a hospital bed arrangement was "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" based on the proximity of beds. The key concept was to check for adjacent beds (horizontally and vertically) while ignoring diagonal placements. 

The solution involved iterating through each cell in the grid and checking the four possible adjacent cells for any beds. If any adjacent beds were found, the arrangement was marked as "UNSAFE"; otherwise, it was "SAFE". The implementation was straightforward and effectively handled the constraints provided.

The final code successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the logic for checking adjacent beds was correctly implemented. The approach was efficient given the constraints, as it only required a single pass through the grid for each test case. This experience reinforced the importance of careful boundary checking when accessing grid elements to avoid index errors. Overall, the problem was a good exercise in grid traversal and condition checking.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] The official solution effectively checks for adjacent beds in a grid by iterating through the rows and columns separately. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of test cases and initializing a list to store results.

2. **Grid Construction**: For each test case, it constructs a 2D list (grid) to represent the arrangement of beds.

3. **Row Check**: The solution first checks each row for adjacent beds by comparing each element with the next one in the same row. If two adjacent beds are found, it marks the arrangement as "UNSAFE" and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Column Check**: After checking rows, it checks each column for adjacent beds by comparing each element with the one directly below it. Again, if adjacent beds are found, it marks the arrangement as "UNSAFE".

5. **Final Result**: If no adjacent beds are found after both checks, it appends "SAFE" to the results list.

6. **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Key Takeaways:
- The official solution is efficient in that it checks for adjacency in a straightforward manner, ensuring that it only traverses the grid a minimal number of times.
- The separation of row and column checks simplifies the logic and makes it easier to understand.
- The use of a flag to indicate whether an unsafe condition has been found allows for early termination of checks, which can save time in larger grids.

### Reflection:
My initial approach was similar in logic but combined the checks into a single function, which could have made it less clear. The official solution's method of separating row and column checks is more intuitive and easier to follow. Additionally, the use of a flag for early exit is a good practice that I can incorporate into my future solutions to improve efficiency.

[Problem]
    Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
    The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
    The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
    This is a SAFE example:

    0 1
    This is an UNSAFE example:
    0 1 1
