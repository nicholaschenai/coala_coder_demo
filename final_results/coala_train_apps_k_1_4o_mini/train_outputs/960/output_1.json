    "raw_msg": "Based on the insights and memories provided, I will revise the solution to correctly generate the required pattern for each test case. The output will consist of K lines for each test case, where the first K lines count up from 0 to the current line index, and the next K lines count down from the current line index to 0. \n\nHere\u2019s the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef print_pattern(T, test_cases):\n    # Iterate through each test case\n    for k in test_cases:\n        K = k\n        \n        # Generate the first K lines counting up\n        for i in range(K):\n            line = ' '.join(bin(x)[2:] for x in range(1, i + 2))\n            print(line)\n        \n        # Generate the next K lines counting down\n        for i in range(K):\n            line = ' '.join(bin(x)[2:] for x in range(i + 1, 0, -1))\n            print(line)\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\n# Read each test case value into a list\ntest_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(T)]\n# Call the function to print the pattern\nprint_pattern(T, test_cases)\n```\n\n### Key Features of the Code:\n- The first loop generates K lines where each line contains binary representations of numbers from 1 to the current line index.\n- The second loop generates K lines where each line contains binary representations of numbers counting down from the current line index to 1.\n- The output is formatted correctly with spaces between binary numbers, and each test case's output is printed consecutively without additional blank lines. \n\nThis implementation should now meet the requirements of the problem statement and produce the expected output.",
