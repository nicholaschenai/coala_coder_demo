    "raw_msg": "Based on the insights and memories provided, I will revise the solution to correctly generate the required pattern of binary numbers for each test case. The output will consist of K lines for each test case, where each line contains binary representations of numbers starting from 1 up to the required count for that line.\n\nHere\u2019s the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef print_pattern(T, test_cases):\n    # Iterate through each test case\n    for k in test_cases:\n        K = k\n        # Initialize a counter for binary numbers\n        counter = 1\n        \n        # Generate K lines\n        for i in range(1, K + 1):\n            line = \"\"\n            # For each line, generate the required number of binary numbers\n            for j in range(i):\n                # Convert the current counter to binary and append to the line\n                line += bin(counter)[2:] + \" \"\n                counter += 1\n            # Print the constructed line, stripping any trailing spaces\n            print(line.strip())\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\n# Read each test case value into a list\ntest_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(T)]\n# Call the function to print the pattern\nprint_pattern(T, test_cases)\n```\n\n### Key Features of the Code:\n- The outer loop iterates through each test case.\n- The inner loop generates the required number of binary numbers for each line based on the current line index.\n- The `counter` variable keeps track of the current number to be converted to binary.\n- The output is formatted correctly with spaces between binary numbers, and each test case's output is printed consecutively.\n\nThis implementation should now meet the requirements of the problem statement and produce the expected output.",
