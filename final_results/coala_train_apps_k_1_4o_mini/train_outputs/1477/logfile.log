You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string.

Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.
The second line contains the string S.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 50
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 50
- S will consist of uppercase English letters.

-----Example-----
Input:
2
4
DCBA
7
XYZZYZZ

Output:
ADCB
XYYZZZZ

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB
Example case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters. So the answer will be XYYZZZZ

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by moving one character from any position in a given string to any other position. We will do this for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string and consider it as the character to be moved. For each character, we will remove it from its original position and try inserting it at every possible position in the string. After each insertion, we will check if the new string is smaller than the previously found smallest string. We will keep track of the smallest string found during this process.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_smallest_string(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N = length of test_case
           S = test_case
           smallest_string = S
           
           for i from 0 to N-1:  // for each character in S
               char_to_move = S[i]
               remaining_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]  // string without the character
               
               for j from 0 to N:  // try inserting char_to_move at every position
                   new_string = remaining_string[:j] + char_to_move + remaining_string[j:]
                   if new_string < smallest_string:
                       smallest_string = new_string

    [Task]:
        The chef is having one string of English lower case alphabets only. The chef wants to remove all "abc" special pairs where a,b,c are occurring consecutively. After removing the pair, create a new string and again remove "abc" special pair from a newly formed string. Repeate the process until no such pair remains in a string.

        -----Input:-----
        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
        - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, $String$. 

        -----Output:-----
        For each testcase, output in a single line answer, new String with no "abc" special pair.

        -----Constraints:-----
        $T \leq 2 $

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restatement of the Problem**: 
           We need to repeatedly remove all occurrences of the substring "abc" from a given string until no such substring remains. This process needs to be applied to multiple test cases.

        2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: 
           To solve this problem, we can use a loop to continuously search for the substring "abc" in the string. Each time we find it, we will remove it and check the resulting string again. We will keep doing this until the string no longer contains "abc". 

        3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
           ```
           function remove_abc_pairs(string):
               while "abc" is in string:
                   remove the first occurrence of "abc" from string
               return string

           function main():
               read number of test cases T
               for each test case:
                   read string
                   result = remove_abc_pairs(string)
                   print result
           ```

        4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
        ```python
        def remove_abc_pairs(string):
            while "abc" in string:
                string = string.replace("abc", "", 1)  # Remove the first occurrence of "abc"
            return string

        def main():
            T = int(input())  # Read number of test cases
            for _ in range(T):
                string = input().strip()  # Read each string
                result = remove_abc_pairs(string)  # Process the string
                print(result)  # Output the result

The first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.
The second line contains the string S.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 50
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 50
- S will consist of uppercase English letters.

-----Example-----
Input:
2
4
DCBA
7
XYZZYZZ

Output:
ADCB
XYYZZZZ

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB
Example case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters. So the answer will be XYYZZZZ

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

   To achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we can iterate through each character in the string, remove it, and then try to insert it back at every possible position in the remaining string. We will keep track of the smallest string encountered during this process.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function find_smallest_string(S):
       smallest = S  # Start with the original string as the smallest
       for i from 0 to length of S - 1:
           char = S[i]  # Character to remove
           remaining = S[:i] + S[i+1:]  # Remaining string after removal
           for j from 0 to length of remaining:
               new_string = remaining[:j] + char + remaining[j:]  # Insert char at position j
               if new_string < smallest:
                   smallest = new_string  # Update smallest if new_string is smaller
       return smallest

   function main():
       T = read number of test cases
       for each test case:
           N = read length of string
           S = read string
           result = find_smallest_string(S)
           print result
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
```python
def find_smallest_string(S):
    smallest = S  # Start with the original string as the smallest
    for i in range(len(S)):
        char = S[i]  # Character to remove
        remaining = S[:i] + S[i+1:]  # Remaining string after removal
        for j in range(len(remaining) + 1):
            new_string = remaining[:j] + char + remaining[j:]  # Insert char at position j
            if new_string < smallest:
                smallest = new_string  # Update smallest if new_string is smaller
    return smallest

def main():
    T = int(input())  # Read number of test cases
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())  # Read length of string
        S = input().strip()  # Read string
        result = find_smallest_string(S)  # Process the string
        print(result)  # Output the result

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] The problem involved finding the lexicographically smallest string by removing one character from a given string and reinserting it at any position. The solution required iterating through each character, removing it, and testing all possible reinsertion points in the remaining string to determine the smallest possible configuration.

The core concept tested here was the manipulation of strings and understanding of lexicographical order. The approach that worked involved maintaining a variable to track the smallest string encountered during the iterations. The nested loops allowed for comprehensive testing of all possible configurations after removing a character.

The final solution was implemented in Python, using a straightforward approach without any external libraries. The code effectively handled multiple test cases and produced the correct outputs. The key takeaway was the importance of systematically exploring all possibilities in combinatorial problems to ensure the optimal solution is found. 

Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

```python
def find_smallest_string(S):
    smallest = S
    for i in range(len(S)):
        char = S[i]
        remaining = S[:i] + S[i+1:]
        for j in range(len(remaining) + 1):
            new_string = remaining[:j] + char + remaining[j:]
            if new_string < smallest:
                smallest = new_string
    return smallest

def main():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        S = input().strip()
        result = find_smallest_string(S)
        print(result)

main()
``` 

This experience reinforced the importance of thorough testing and the ability to manipulate strings effectively in Python.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string.

Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.
The second line contains the string S.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 50
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 50
- S will consist of uppercase English letters.

-----Example-----
Input:
2
4
DCBA
7
XYZZYZZ

Output:
ADCB
XYYZZZZ

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB
Example case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters. So the answer will be XYYZZZZ

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for _1 in range(int(input())):
 n=int(input())
 s=input().strip()
 answer=s
 for i in range(len(s)):
  c=s[i]
  string=s[:i]+s[i+1:]
  for j in range(len(string)+1):
   answer=min(answer, string[:j]+c+string[j:])
 print(answer)

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] The official solution closely mirrors my approach, which indicates that my understanding of the problem was correct. Both solutions involve iterating through each character in the string, removing it, and then reinserting it at every possible position in the remaining string. The key difference lies in the use of the `min` function in the official solution, which simplifies the comparison and updating of the smallest string found.

One insight from the official solution is the efficiency of using `min` directly to compare the current candidate string with the smallest string found so far. This reduces the need for an explicit conditional check, making the code cleaner and potentially more efficient. 

Additionally, both solutions have a similar time complexity of O(N^2) due to the nested loops, where N is the length of the string. However, the official solution's use of `min` may provide a slight edge in readability and conciseness.

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of considering built-in functions for comparisons and updates, as they can lead to cleaner and more efficient code.
