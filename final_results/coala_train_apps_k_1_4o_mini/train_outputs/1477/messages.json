You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string.\n\nFind the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.\nThe second line contains the string S.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 50\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 50\n- S will consist of uppercase English letters.\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n2\n4\nDCBA\n7\nXYZZYZZ\n\nOutput:\nADCB\nXYYZZZZ\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB\nExample case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters. So the answer will be XYYZZZZ\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The solution required iterating through each character, removing it, and testing all possible reinsertion points in the remaining string to determine the smallest possible configuration.\n\nThe core concept tested here was the manipulation of strings and understanding of lexicographical order. The approach that worked involved maintaining a variable to track the smallest string encountered during the iterations. The nested loops allowed for comprehensive testing of all possible configurations after removing a character.\n\nThe final solution was implemented in Python, using a straightforward approach without any external libraries.

Both solutions involve iterating through each character in the string, removing it, and then reinserting it at every possible position in the remaining string. The key difference lies in the use of the `min` function in the official solution, which simplifies the comparison and updating of the smallest string found.\n\nOne insight from the official solution is the efficiency of using `min` directly to compare the current candidate string with the smallest string found so far. This reduces the need for an explicit conditional check, making the code cleaner and potentially more efficient. \n\nAdditionally, both solutions have a similar time complexity of O(N^2) due to the nested loops, where N is the length of the string. However, the official solution's use of `min` may provide a slight edge in readability and conciseness.\n\nOverall, the experience reinforced the importance of considering built-in functions for comparisons and updates, as they can lead to cleaner and more efficient code."

It first reads the number of test cases and iterates through each case, reading the string and its length. For each string, it calls another function to determine the smallest possible arrangement. Finally, it prints the result for each test case. The function effectively handles input and output while delegating the string manipulation to another part of the code.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to optimize string arrangements, particularly in competitive programming or algorithm design.
