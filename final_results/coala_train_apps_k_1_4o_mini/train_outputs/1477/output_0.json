    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   We need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by removing one character from a given string and reinserting it at any position. This needs to be done for multiple test cases.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: \n   To achieve the lexicographically smallest string, we can iterate through each character in the string, remove it, and then try to insert it back at every possible position in the remaining string. We will keep track of the smallest string encountered during this process.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_smallest_string(S):\n       smallest = S  # Start with the original string as the smallest\n       for i from 0 to length of S - 1:\n           char = S[i]  # Character to remove\n           remaining = S[:i] + S[i+1:]  # Remaining string after removal\n           for j from 0 to length of remaining:\n               new_string = remaining[:j] + char + remaining[j:]  # Insert char at position j\n               if new_string < smallest:\n                   smallest = new_string  # Update smallest if new_string is smaller\n       return smallest\n\n   function main():\n       T = read number of test cases\n       for each test case:\n           N = read length of string\n           S = read string\n           result = find_smallest_string(S)\n           print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef find_smallest_string(S):\n    smallest = S  # Start with the original string as the smallest\n    for i in range(len(S)):\n        char = S[i]  # Character to remove\n        remaining = S[:i] + S[i+1:]  # Remaining string after removal\n        for j in range(len(remaining) + 1):\n            new_string = remaining[:j] + char + remaining[j:]  # Insert char at position j\n            if new_string < smallest:\n                smallest = new_string  # Update smallest if new_string is smaller\n    return smallest\n\ndef main():\n    T = int(input())  # Read number of test cases\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())  # Read length of string\n        S = input().strip()  # Read string\n        result = find_smallest_string(S)  # Process the string\n        print(result)  # Output the result\n\nmain()\n```",
