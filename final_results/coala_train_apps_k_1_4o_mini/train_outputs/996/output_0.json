    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The problem involves a billiards game played over several rounds between two players. After each round, we need to calculate the cumulative scores of both players and determine who had the highest lead at the end of any round. The player with the maximum lead at any point during the game is declared the winner, along with the value of that lead.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Read the number of rounds and the scores for each round.\n   - Maintain cumulative scores for both players as we process each round.\n   - After each round, calculate the current lead and determine if it is the maximum lead observed so far.\n   - Keep track of which player had that maximum lead.\n   - Finally, output the player number and the maximum lead.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Initialize cumulative_score_player1 and cumulative_score_player2 to 0\n   Initialize max_lead to 0\n   Initialize winner to 0\n\n   Read the number of rounds N\n\n   For each round from 1 to N:\n       Read scores for player1 and player2\n       Update cumulative scores for both players\n       Calculate current_lead as the absolute difference between the two cumulative scores\n       Determine the current_leader based on which player has the higher cumulative score\n       \n       If current_lead is greater than max_lead:\n           Update max_lead to current_lead\n           Update winner to current_leader\n\n   Output winner and max_lead\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\n# Function to determine the winner and maximum lead in the billiards game\ndef find_winner_and_lead():\n    # Initialize cumulative scores and tracking variables\n    cumulative_score_player1 = 0\n    cumulative_score_player2 = 0\n    max_lead = 0\n    winner = 0\n\n    # Read the number of rounds\n    N = int(input())\n    \n    # Process each round\n    for _ in range(N):\n        # Read scores for both players\n        scores = input().split()\n        score_player1 = int(scores[0])\n        score_player2 = int(scores[1])\n        \n        # Update cumulative scores\n        cumulative_score_player1 += score_player1\n        cumulative_score_player2 += score_player2\n        \n        # Calculate current lead\n        if cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:\n            current_lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2\n            current_leader = 1\n        else:\n            current_lead = cumulative_score_player2 - cumulative_score_player1\n            current_leader = 2\n        \n        # Update max lead and winner if current lead is greater\n        if current_lead > max_lead:\n            max_lead = current_lead\n            winner = current_leader\n\n    # Output the winner and the maximum lead\n    print(winner, max_lead)\n\n# Call the function to execute the solution\nfind_winner_and_lead()\n```",
