## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
purposes this is sufficient.
The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
total score is declared the winner.
The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
RoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890

The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
each round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23
Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
at the end of round 1) during the game.
Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
Input
The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
â‰¤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 â‰¤ Si â‰¤
1000 and 1 â‰¤ Ti â‰¤ 1000.  
Output
Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
maximum lead attained by the winner.
Example
Input:
5
140 82

INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to determine the winner of a billiards game between two players based on their scores over several rounds. Instead of simply summing the scores, we will track the cumulative scores after each round and identify which player had the highest lead at any point during the game. The player with the maximum lead at the end of any round will be declared the winner, along with the value of that lead.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Read the number of rounds.
   - Initialize cumulative scores for both players to zero.
   - For each round, update the cumulative scores based on the scores provided.
   - Calculate the lead for the current round and determine which player is leading.
   - Keep track of the maximum lead and the corresponding player throughout all rounds.
   - Finally, output the player number with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Read integer N (number of rounds)
   Initialize cumulative_score_player1 = 0
   Initialize cumulative_score_player2 = 0
   Initialize max_lead = 0
   Initialize winner = 0

   For each round from 1 to N:
       Read scores Si (Player 1) and Ti (Player 2)
       Update cumulative_score_player1 += Si
       Update cumulative_score_player2 += Ti
       
       If cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:
           lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2
           If lead > max_lead:
               max_lead = lead
               winner = 1
       Else:
           lead = cumulative_score_player2 - cumulative_score_player1
           If lead > max_lead:
               max_lead = lead
               winner = 2

   Output winner and max_lead
   ```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I was tasked with determining the winner of a game played with a number \( N \). The game rules allowed players to either subtract 1 from \( N \) or divide \( N \) by any of its odd divisors greater than 1. The key insight was recognizing that the game's outcome could be determined recursively based on the current player's options.

    The solution involved creating a recursive function `can_win(N)` that checks if the current player can force a win. The base case was straightforward: if \( N \) is 1, the current player loses. For even \( N \), the only move is to subtract 1, which leads to the opponent's turn. For odd \( N \), I checked all odd divisors to see if any move would lead to a position where the opponent would lose.

    The implementation was successful, and all test cases passed. The recursive approach effectively captured the game's dynamics, allowing for a clear determination of the winner based on the value of \( N \). This experience reinforced the importance of analyzing game theory problems through recursive strategies and understanding the implications of each possible move. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_win(N):
        if N == 1:
            return False
        if N % 2 == 0:
            return not can_win(N - 1)
        for d in range(3, int(N**0.5) + 1, 2):
            if N % d == 0:
                if not can_win(N // d):
                    return True
                if d != N // d and not can_win(d):
                    return True
        return False

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        if can_win(N):
            print("Me")
        else:

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
purposes this is sufficient.
The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
total score is declared the winner.
The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
RoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890

The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
each round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23
Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
at the end of round 1) during the game.
Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
Input
The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
â‰¤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 â‰¤ Si â‰¤
1000 and 1 â‰¤ Ti â‰¤ 1000.  
Output
Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
maximum lead attained by the winner.
Example
Input:
5
140 82
89 134

INFO - [Task id] 996 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem involves a billiards game played over several rounds between two players. After each round, we need to calculate the cumulative scores of both players and determine who had the highest lead at the end of any round. The player with the maximum lead at any point during the game is declared the winner, along with the value of that lead.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Read the number of rounds and the scores for each round.
   - Maintain cumulative scores for both players as we process each round.
   - After each round, calculate the current lead and determine if it is the maximum lead observed so far.
   - Keep track of which player had that maximum lead.
   - Finally, output the player number and the maximum lead.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize cumulative_score_player1 and cumulative_score_player2 to 0
   Initialize max_lead to 0
   Initialize winner to 0

   Read the number of rounds N

   For each round from 1 to N:
       Read scores for player1 and player2
       Update cumulative scores for both players
       Calculate current_lead as the absolute difference between the two cumulative scores
       Determine the current_leader based on which player has the higher cumulative score
       
       If current_lead is greater than max_lead:
           Update max_lead to current_lead
           Update winner to current_leader

   Output winner and max_lead

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] In this task, I was required to determine the winner of a billiards game based on the maximum lead achieved by either player over several rounds. The core concepts involved cumulative score tracking, lead calculation, and determining the player with the maximum lead at any point in the game.

The solution involved initializing cumulative scores for both players, reading the number of rounds, and processing each round's scores. After updating the cumulative scores, I calculated the current lead and checked if it exceeded the maximum lead recorded so far. If it did, I updated the maximum lead and the corresponding winner.

The final implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test case. The code effectively handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that the results were printed in the specified format. The approach was efficient, with a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of rounds, which is suitable given the constraints. 

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of careful score tracking and lead calculation in competitive scenarios, and the solution was implemented without any unexpected errors. The final code snippet is as follows:

```python
def find_winner_and_lead():
    cumulative_score_player1 = 0
    cumulative_score_player2 = 0
    max_lead = 0
    winner = 0

    N = int(input())

        cumulative_score_player1 += score_player1
        cumulative_score_player2 += score_player2

else:
    print('1', mlead1)



INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] The official solution effectively simplifies the problem by maintaining separate cumulative scores for both players and tracking the maximum lead for each player in a straightforward manner. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Initialization**: The solution initializes cumulative scores (`s1` for Player 1 and `s2` for Player 2) and maximum leads (`mlead1` for Player 1 and `mlead2` for Player 2) to zero. This sets a clear starting point for score accumulation and lead tracking.

2. **Single Loop for Input Processing**: The solution uses a single loop to read the number of rounds and the scores for each round. This is efficient and keeps the code concise.

3. **Lead Calculation**: After updating the cumulative scores, the solution checks which player is leading and calculates the lead accordingly. It then updates the maximum lead for the leading player using the `max` function, ensuring that only the highest lead is retained.

4. **Final Decision**: At the end of the loop, the solution compares the maximum leads of both players and prints the winner along with their maximum lead. This final comparison is straightforward and avoids unnecessary complexity.

In contrast, my initial approach was similar but could have been more concise. I maintained cumulative scores and calculated leads correctly, but the final decision-making process could have been streamlined. The official solution's use of separate maximum lead variables for each player simplifies the final comparison and reduces the need for additional logic.

Overall, the official solution is efficient and clear, demonstrating a good balance between readability and performance. It serves as a reminder to focus on simplicity and clarity in problem-solving, especially when dealing with straightforward accumulations and comparisons.

    end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

    Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
    RoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890

    The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
    each round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23
    Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
    The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
    at the end of round 1) during the game.
    Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
    lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
    always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
    Input
    The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
    â‰¤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
    2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
    Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
    and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 â‰¤ Si â‰¤
    1000 and 1 â‰¤ Ti â‰¤ 1000.  
    Output
    Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
    W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
    maximum lead attained by the winner.
    Example
    Input:
    5
    140 82
    89 134
    90 110
    112 106
    88 90

    Output:
    1 58
