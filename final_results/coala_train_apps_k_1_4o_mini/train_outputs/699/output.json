    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   Chef wants to organize Division-3 contests using problems created by several setters. Each setter has created a certain number of problems, and Chef needs a specific number of problems to host one contest. Given a limited number of days, we need to determine how many contests Chef can host based on the problems available.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - For each test case, we will first read the number of setters, the number of problems required for one contest, and the number of days available.\n   - Next, we will sum up all the problems created by the setters.\n   - We will then calculate how many contests can be formed using the total number of problems by dividing the total problems by the number of problems needed for one contest.\n   - Finally, we will compare the number of contests that can be formed with the number of days available, and the result will be the minimum of these two values.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function max_division3_contests(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read N, K, D\n           read A (list of problems from each setter)\n           total_problems = sum(A)\n           contests_possible = total_problems // K\n           max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n           print(max_contests)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef max_division3_contests(T, test_cases):\n    # Iterate through each test case\n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Read N (number of setters), K (problems needed for one contest), D (days available)\n        N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n        # Read the list of problems created by each setter\n        A = case[3]\n        \n        # Calculate the total number of problems available\n        total_problems = sum(A)\n        \n        # Calculate how many contests can be formed\n        contests_possible = total_problems // K\n        \n        # The maximum contests Chef can host is the minimum of contests possible and days available\n        max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n        \n        # Print the result for the current test case\n        print(max_contests)\n\n# Read input\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    # Read N, K, D\n    N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n    # Read the problems created by each setter\n    A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    # Store the test case\n    test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))\n\n# Call the function with the input data\nmax_division3_contests(T, test_cases)\n```",
