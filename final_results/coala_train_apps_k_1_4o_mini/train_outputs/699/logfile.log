## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \leq i \leq N$.    
A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.
Given these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?

-----Input:-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.
- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ respectively. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^2$
- $1 \le K \le 10^9$ 
- $1 \le D \le 10^9$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^7$ for each valid $i$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (40 points):
- $N = 1$
- $1 \le A_1 \le 10^5$
Subtask #2 (60 points): Original constraints

1 10 3

19 2
3 3 300
1 1 1

-----Sample Output:-----
0
2
7
4
1

-----Explanation:-----
- 
Example case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.
- 
Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.
- 
Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef wants to organize Division-3 contests over a certain number of days. Each contest requires a specific number of problems. There are multiple problem setters, each contributing a certain number of problems. The goal is to determine how many contests Chef can host given the total number of problems available, the number of problems required for each contest, and the maximum number of days available for hosting contests.

2. **Conceptualize a solution:**
   - For each test case, read the number of setters, the number of problems required for a contest, and the number of days available.
   - Read the number of problems each setter has created.
   - Calculate the total number of problems available by summing the contributions from all setters.
   - Determine how many contests can be formed by dividing the total number of problems by the number of problems required for each contest.
   - The maximum number of contests Chef can host is the lesser of the number of contests that can be formed and the number of days available.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_contests(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, K, D
           read A (list of problems from each setter)
           total_problems = sum(A)
           contests_possible = total_problems // K
           max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
           print(max_contests)
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 solution:**
```python
def max_contests(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(T):
        N, K, D = test_cases[i][0]
        A = test_cases[i][1]
        
        # Calculate total number of problems
        total_problems = sum(A)
        
        # Calculate how many contests can be formed
        contests_possible = total_problems // K
        
        # The maximum contests Chef can host is limited by the number of days
        max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
        
        # Store the result for this test case
        results.append(max_contests)
    
    # Print all results for each test case
    for result in results:
        print(result)

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing elements based on their indices. The key insight was recognizing that the maximum reduction possible is the sum of the first N natural numbers, which can be calculated using the formula \(N \times (N + 1) / 2\).

    Initially, the solution incorrectly handled the conditions for determining if the sequence could be made "good." The logic needed to explicitly check if the total sum was zero, if it was positive and could be reduced to zero, or if it was negative, which would immediately result in "NO." 

    The final working solution iterates through each test case, calculates the total sum and maximum reduction, and checks the conditions correctly. The code snippet that encapsulates the solution is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            A = case[1]
            total_sum = sum(A)
            max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2
        
            if total_sum == 0:
                print("YES")
            elif total_sum > 0 and total_sum <= max_reduction:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all possible conditions and edge cases when solving problems involving sums and modifications of sequences.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef wants to organize Division-3 contests using problems created by several setters. Each setter has created a certain number of problems, and Chef needs a specific number of problems to host one contest. Given a limited number of days, we need to determine how many contests Chef can host based on the problems available.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each test case, we will first read the number of setters, the number of problems required for one contest, and the number of days available.
   - Next, we will sum up all the problems created by the setters.
   - We will then calculate how many contests can be formed using the total number of problems by dividing the total problems by the number of problems needed for one contest.
   - Finally, we will compare the number of contests that can be formed with the number of days available, and the result will be the minimum of these two values.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_division3_contests(T, test_cases):

-----Explanation:-----
- 
Example case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.
- 
Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.
- 
Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.

INFO - [Task id] 699 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef wants to organize Division-3 contests using problems created by several setters. Each setter has created a certain number of problems, and Chef needs a specific number of problems to host one contest. Given a limited number of days, we need to determine how many contests Chef can host based on the problems available.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each test case, we will first read the number of setters, the number of problems required for one contest, and the number of days available.
   - Next, we will sum up all the problems created by the setters.
   - We will then calculate how many contests can be formed using the total number of problems by dividing the total problems by the number of problems needed for one contest.
   - Finally, we will compare the number of contests that can be formed with the number of days available, and the result will be the minimum of these two values.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_division3_contests(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, K, D
           read A (list of problems from each setter)
           total_problems = sum(A)
           contests_possible = total_problems // K
           max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)

INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the problems created by several setters. The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems available and calculating how many contests could be formed based on the required number of problems per contest, while also considering the limited number of days available.

The solution involved reading multiple test cases, summing the problems from each setter, and then calculating the number of contests possible by dividing the total problems by the number of problems needed for one contest. The final result for each test case was the minimum of the contests possible and the days available.

The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the constraints provided. The code was structured to read input, process each test case, and output the results efficiently. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all test cases, demonstrating that the approach was effective. 

Key code snippet:
```python
total_problems = sum(A)
contests_possible = total_problems // K
max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
``` 

This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all constraints are considered in the final calculations.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \leq i \leq N$.    
A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.
Given these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for T in range(int (eval(input()))):
 N,K,D=list(map(int,input().split()))
 A=list(map(int,input().split()))
 P=sum(A)//K 
 print(min(P,D))


INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] The official solution is concise and effectively addresses the problem with minimal code. It follows a straightforward approach that aligns closely with my own solution, but it is more succinct. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Input Handling**: The official solution uses `eval(input())` to read the number of test cases, which is a compact way to handle input but can be risky if not controlled. Itâ€™s generally better to use `int(input())` for safety.

2. **Single Line Calculations**: The official solution combines the calculation of total problems and the number of contests possible into a single line: `P = sum(A) // K`. This reduces the number of lines and makes the code cleaner.

3. **Direct Output**: Instead of storing results in a list and printing them later, the official solution prints the result directly after calculating it. This is efficient for problems where immediate output is acceptable.

4. **Efficiency**: Both solutions have similar time complexity, but the official solution is slightly more efficient in terms of space since it does not store intermediate results.

Overall, the official solution is effective in its simplicity and directness. It reinforces the importance of writing concise code while maintaining clarity. In future problems, I should aim to streamline my solutions similarly, focusing on reducing unnecessary variables and lines of code.
