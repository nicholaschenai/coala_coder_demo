Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \\leq i \\leq N$.    \nA Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.\nGiven these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?\n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.\n- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$ respectively. \n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2015 the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^3$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^2$\n- $1 \\le K \\le 10^9$ \n- $1 \\le D \\le 10^9$\n- $1 \\le A_i \\le 10^7$ for each valid $i$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (40 points):\n- $N = 1$\n- $1 \\le A_1 \\le 10^5$\nSubtask #2 (60 points): Original constraints\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n5\n1 5 31\n4\n1 10 3\n23\n2 5 7\n20 36\n2 5 10\n19 2\n3 3 300\n1 1 1\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n0\n2\n7\n4\n1\n\n-----Explanation:-----\n- \nExample case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.\n- \nExample case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.\n- \nExample case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The key insight was recognizing that the maximum reduction possible is the sum of the first N natural numbers, which can be calculated using the formula \\(N \\times (N + 1) / 2\\).\n\n    Initially, the solution incorrectly handled the conditions for determining if the sequence could be made \"good.\" The logic needed to explicitly check if the total sum was zero, if it was positive and could be reduced to zero, or if it was negative, which would immediately result in \"NO.\" \n\n    The final working solution iterates through each test case, calculates the total sum and maximum reduction, and checks the conditions correctly. The code snippet that encapsulates the solution is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            A = case[1]\n            total_sum = sum(A)\n            max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2\n        \n            if total_sum == 0:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            elif total_sum > 0 and total_sum <= max_reduction:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all possible conditions and edge cases when solving problems involving sums and modifications of sequences.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
