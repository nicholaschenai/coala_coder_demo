There are n appetizers numbered from 0 to n-1 such that if the appetizers are arrayed in this order, they will display the message. The Chef plans to display them in this order on a table that can be viewed by all guests as they enter. The appetizers will only be served once all guests are seated.\n\nThe appetizers are not necessarily finished in the same order as they are numbered. So, when an appetizer is finished the Chef will write the number on a piece of paper and place it beside the appetizer on a counter between the kitchen and the restaurant. A server will retrieve this appetizer and place it in the proper location according to the number written beside it.\n\nThe Chef has a penchant for binary numbers. The number of appetizers created is a power of 2, say n = 2k. Furthermore, he has written the number of the appetizer in binary with exactly k bits. That is, binary numbers with fewer than k bits are padded on the left with zeros so they are written with exactly k bits.\n\nUnfortunately, this has unforseen complications. A binary number still \"looks\" binary when it is written upside down. For example, the binary number \"0101\" looks like \"1010\" when read upside down and the binary number \"110\" looks like \"011\" (the Chef uses simple vertical lines to denote a 1 bit). The Chef didn't realize that the servers would read the numbers upside down so he doesn't rotate the paper when he places it on the counter. Thus, when the server picks up an appetizer they place it the location indexed by the binary number when it is read upside down.\n\nYou are given the message the chef intended to display and you are to display the message that will be displayed after the servers move all appetizers to their locations based on the binary numbers they read.\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line consists of a single integer T \u2264 25 indicating the number of test cases to follow. Each test case consists of a single line beginning with an integer 1 \u2264 k \u2264 16 followed by a string of precisely 2k characters. The integer and the string are separated by a single space. The string has no spaces and is composed only of lower case letters from `a` to `z`.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case you are to output the scrambled message on a single line.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n2\n2 chef\n4 enjoyourapplepie\n\nOutput:\ncehf\neayejpuinpopolre\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is \\(N \\times (N - 1) / 2\\).\n\n    #### Key Concepts:\n    1. **Maximum and Minimum Values of f(P):** The maximum value occurs with a descending permutation, while the minimum is 0 (for N = 1).\n    2. **Adjustment of Permutation:** The challenge was to adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K by swapping elements to reduce the contribution of adjacent maximums.\n\n    #### Strategies and Issues:\n    - The initial approach involved starting with a descending permutation and attempting to reduce f(P) by swapping adjacent elements. However, this logic was flawed as it did not effectively account for how adjacent maximums changed with swaps.\n    - The code consistently returned `-1` for valid cases, indicating a failure to construct the desired permutation.\n\n    #### Lessons Learned:\n    - A more systematic approach is needed to generate permutations that can achieve specific values of K. The adjustment logic must be refined to ensure that all possible values of f(P) can be reached.\n    - Future implementations should focus on a clearer strategy for adjusting the permutation based on the difference between the current f(P) and the target K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n    The following code snippet represents the last attempt, which ultimately failed to pass the test cases:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n        results = []  # To store results for each test case\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum possible f(P)\n        \n            if K > max_f or K < 0:  # Check if K is out of bounds\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                # Start with the descending permutation\n                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                current_f = max_f  # Start with the maximum f(P)\n            \n                # Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K\n                for i in range(N - 1):\n                    if current_f == K:\n                        break\n                    # If we can reduce the current_f by 1, we swap elements\n                    if current_f > K:\n                        # Swap the last two elements to reduce the f(P) value\n                        permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                        current_f -= 1  # Decrease the f(P) value by 1\n            \n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))  # Store the result as a string\n\n        # Print all results at once for efficiency\n        print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n    ```\n\n    This summary encapsulates the core concepts, strategies attempted, and the lessons learned from the problem-solving process.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. It splits the input to extract the integer `k` and the message string.\n\n2. **Binary Reversal Function**: The function `reversebinary(bits, n)` is defined to convert a decimal number `n` into its binary representation with a specified number of bits (`bits`). It constructs the binary string by repeatedly taking the modulus of `n` with 2 and shifting `n` right until it reaches zero. This function also handles padding with zeros implicitly by appending '0' when `n` is zero.\n\n3. **Rearranging the Message**: The solution initializes a list `newmsg` to hold the rearranged characters. It iterates over each character in the original message and uses the `reversebinary` function to determine the new index for each character based on its original index. The character is then placed in the `newmsg` list at the calculated index.\n\n4. **Output**: Finally, the rearranged message is printed by joining the list into a string.\n\n### Key Takeaways:\n- The use of a dedicated function for binary reversal simplifies the main logic and improves readability.\n- The approach efficiently handles the conversion and rearrangement in a single pass through the message, ensuring that the solution is both time and space efficient.\n- The official solution effectively manages the binary representation and its reversal, which is crucial for solving the problem correctly.\n\nIn contrast, my initial solution was more verbose and included unnecessary steps, such as manually formatting the binary string. The official solution's method of constructing the binary string directly during the reversal process is more elegant and efficient. This experience highlights the importance of breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable functions to enhance clarity and maintainability."
