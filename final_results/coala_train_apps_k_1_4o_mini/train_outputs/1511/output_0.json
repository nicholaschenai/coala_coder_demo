    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\nThe problem involves determining how many magnets can attract pieces of iron in a given row of cells, based on specific attraction rules. Each cell can contain either a magnet, a piece of iron, an empty space, a conducting sheet, or be blocked. The attraction power between a magnet and a piece of iron is influenced by their distance and the presence of conducting sheets, and it can only be positive if there are no blocked cells between them.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the values of N (number of cells) and K (a constant affecting attraction power), followed by the string S representing the cells.\n2. **Segmentation**: Split the string S into segments separated by blocked cells ('X'). Each segment can be processed independently.\n3. **Attraction Calculation**: For each segment, identify the positions of magnets ('M') and iron ('I'). Calculate the attraction power for each pair of magnets and iron, considering the number of conducting sheets (':') between them.\n4. **Greedy Matching**: Use a greedy approach to match magnets to iron pieces based on the calculated attraction power. Keep track of which magnets and iron pieces have been matched to ensure each can only be used once.\n5. **Output the Results**: After processing all test cases, output the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron for each test case.\n\n### Pseudocode\n```\nfunction max_magnets(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        N, K = test_case[0], test_case[1]\n        S = test_case[2]\n        \n        segments = split S by 'X'\n        total_magnets = 0\n        \n        for segment in segments:\n            magnets = []\n            irons = []\n            sheets_count = 0\n            \n            for i in range(length of segment):\n                if segment[i] == 'M':\n                    magnets.append(i)\n                elif segment[i] == 'I':\n                    irons.append(i)\n                elif segment[i] == ':':\n                    sheets_count += 1\n            \n            # Match magnets to irons\n            matched_magnets = 0\n            while magnets and irons:\n                magnet_index = magnets[0]\n                iron_index = irons[0]\n                distance = abs(magnet_index - iron_index)\n                attraction_power = K + 1 - distance - sheets_count\n                \n                if attraction_power > 0:\n                    matched_magnets += 1\n                    magnets.pop(0)  # Remove the matched magnet\n                    irons.pop(0)    # Remove the matched iron\n                elif magnet_index < iron_index:\n                    magnets.pop(0)  # Move to the next magnet\n                else:\n                    irons.pop(0)    # Move to the next iron\n            \n            total_magnets += matched_magnets\n        \n        results.append(total_magnets)\n    \n    return results\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n```python\ndef max_magnets(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N, K = case[0], case[1]\n        S = case[2]\n        \n        segments = S.split('X')\n        total_magnets = 0\n        \n        for segment in segments:\n            magnets = []\n            irons = []\n            sheets_count = 0\n            \n            for i in range(len(segment)):\n                if segment[i] == 'M':\n                    magnets.append(i)\n                elif segment[i] == 'I':\n                    irons.append(i)\n                elif segment[i] == ':':\n                    sheets_count += 1\n            \n            matched_magnets = 0\n            while magnets and irons:\n                magnet_index = magnets[0]\n                iron_index = irons[0]\n                distance = abs(magnet_index - iron_index)\n                attraction_power = K + 1 - distance - sheets_count\n                \n                if attraction_power > 0:\n                    matched_magnets += 1\n                    magnets.pop(0)  # Remove the matched magnet\n                    irons.pop(0)    # Remove the matched iron\n                elif magnet_index < iron_index:\n                    magnets.pop(0)  # Move to the next magnet\n                else:\n                    irons.pop(0)    # Move to the next iron\n            \n            total_magnets += matched_magnets\n        \n        results.append(total_magnets)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n```",
