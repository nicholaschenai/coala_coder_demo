Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem requires us to classify quotes based on the presence of the word "not". If a quote contains the word "not", it is classified as "Real Fancy". If it does not contain the word "not", it is classified as "regularly fancy". We need to process multiple quotes as input and provide the classification for each.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   We will read the number of quotes (test cases) and then for each quote, we will check if the word "not" is present. To do this, we can split the quote into words and check if "not" is one of those words. Based on this check, we will print "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Read the integer T (number of test cases)
   For each test case from 1 to T:
       Read the quote S
       Split S into words
       If "not" is in the list of words:
           Print "Real Fancy"
       Else:
           Print "regularly fancy"
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
# Function to classify quotes as Real Fancy or regularly fancy
def classify_quotes():
    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    
    # Iterate over each test case
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the quote
        S = input()
        
        # Split the quote into words

## Memories

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
        - N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
        - Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
        - The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
        He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
        You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where i≤j$i \leq j$.
        For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
        c
        co
        cod
        code
        codec
        codeco
        codecod
        codecode
        codecodec
        codecodeco
        ...

        -----Input:-----
        - The first line contains string S$S$ — consisting of lowercase English letters.
        - The second line contains string T$T$ — consisting of lowercase English letters.
        - Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ — the number of queries.
        - Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

        -----Output:-----
        - Print Q$Q$ lines. The i$i$-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row.

        -----Constraints-----
        - 1≤|S|≤105$1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$
        - 1≤|T|≤|S|$1 \leq |T| \leq |S|$
        - 1≤Q≤105$1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$
        - 1≤N≤109$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$

        -----Sample Input:-----
        codechef
        chefcode
        3
        4
        12

        -----Sample Output:-----
        0
        1
        181

        -----Explanation:-----
        Pyramid will be formed as explained in the statement.
        Query 1: Row number 4 of the pyramid is code. The number of occurrences of chefcode in code is 0.
        Query 2: Row number 12 of the pyramid is codechefcode. The number of occurrences of chefcode in codechefcode is 1.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
           We have a string `S` that is used to create an infinite pyramid of rows, where the N-th row contains N characters formed by repeating the string `S` cyclically. We also have another string `T`, and we need to answer multiple queries about how many times `T` appears as a substring in the N-th row of the pyramid.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
           To solve this problem, we need to:
           - Determine the length of the N-th row, which is simply N.
           - Construct the N-th row by taking the first N characters from the cyclic repetition of `S`.
           - Count the occurrences of the string `T` in this row. This involves checking all possible starting positions in the row and seeing if the substring matches `T`.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
           ```
           function count_occurrences(S, T, N):
               row_length = N
               row = construct_row(S, row_length)
               return count_substring_occurrences(row, T)

           function construct_row(S, length):
               result = ""
               for i from 0 to length - 1:
                   result += S[i % len(S)]
               return result

           function count_substring_occurrences(row, T):
               count = 0
               for i from 0 to len(row) - len(T):
                   if row[i:i + len(T)] == T:
                       count += 1
               return count

           read S
           read T
           read Q
           for each query:
               read N
               print count_occurrences(S, T, N)

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

1. **Understanding the Input and Output Requirements:**
   - We need to classify quotes based on the presence of the word "not".
   - The expected output is "Real Fancy" if the word "not" appears as a standalone word in the quote, and "regularly fancy" otherwise.

2. **Identifying the Issue:**
   - The previous solution checks for the substring "not" in the quote, which can lead to incorrect classifications. For example, if the quote contains "nothing", it will incorrectly classify it as "Real Fancy" because "not" is part of "nothing".
   - We need to ensure that "not" is treated as a separate word, which means we should check for "not" surrounded by spaces or at the beginning or end of the quote.

3. **Where I Went Wrong:**
   - The condition `if "not" in quote:` does not account for the word boundaries. It should check for "not" as a complete word rather than just a substring.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - We can split the quote into words and check if "not" is one of those words. This way, we ensure that we are only looking for "not" as a standalone word.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution based on this understanding.

```python
def classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    # Iterate through each quote
    for quote in quotes:
        # Split the quote into words
        words = quote.split()
        # Check if "not" is in the list of words
        if "not" in words:
            print("Real Fancy")
        else:
            print("regularly fancy")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input().strip())
# Read each quote into a list
quotes = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]
# Classify the quotes

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
"I don't have any fancy quotes." - vijju123
Chef was reading some quotes by great people. Now, he is interested in classifying all the fancy quotes he knows. He thinks that all fancy quotes which contain the word "not" are Real Fancy; quotes that do not contain it are regularly fancy.
You are given some quotes. For each quote, you need to tell Chef if it is Real Fancy or just regularly fancy.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$ denoting a quote.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy" (without quotes).

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 50$
- $1 \le |S| \le 100$
- each character of $S$ is either a lowercase English letter or a space

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money exactly according to the demands of the minions. The key requirements were that the total demand from the minions must equal the amount of money Gru has (K), and no individual demand should exceed K.

    ### Key Concepts:
    1. **Total Demand vs. Available Money**: The primary check is whether the sum of all demands equals K.
    2. **Individual Demand Check**: Each minion's demand must not exceed K, but this check was not necessary for the problem as stated since the total demand check suffices.

    ### Attempts and Errors:
    - The initial implementation correctly calculated the total demand but failed to produce the expected output due to misunderstanding the problem requirements. The output was "NO" for cases where it should have been "YES".
    - The logic was simplified to only check if the total demand matched K, which was the correct approach. However, I mistakenly added unnecessary checks that complicated the solution.

    ### Final Working Code:
    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case[0], case[1]
            demands = case[2]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
            if total_demand == K:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read input
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        demands = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, K, demands))

    can_distribute_money(T, test_cases)
    ```

    ### Conclusion:
    The main takeaway is to focus on the problem requirements and ensure that the logic aligns with those requirements. The final solution effectively checks if the total demand matches the available money, which is the crux of the problem.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to classify quotes based on the presence of the word "not". Initially, the solution incorrectly checked for the substring "not" within the quotes, which led to misclassifications when "not" appeared as part of other words (e.g., "nothing"). 

The key insight was to check for "not" as a standalone word. This was achieved by splitting each quote into words and checking if "not" was present in the resulting list. This approach ensured accurate classification of quotes as "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy".

The final working code is as follows:

```python
def classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    # Iterate through each quote
    for quote in quotes:
        # Split the quote into words
        words = quote.split()
        # Check if "not" is in the list of words
        if "not" in words:
            print("Real Fancy")
        else:
            print("regularly fancy")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input().strip())
# Read each quote into a list
quotes = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]
# Classify the quotes
classify_quotes(T, quotes)
```

This experience reinforced the importance of understanding word boundaries when searching for specific terms in strings, especially in natural language processing tasks.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
"I don't have any fancy quotes." - vijju123
Chef was reading some quotes by great people. Now, he is interested in classifying all the fancy quotes he knows. He thinks that all fancy quotes which contain the word "not" are Real Fancy; quotes that do not contain it are regularly fancy.
You are given some quotes. For each quote, you need to tell Chef if it is Real Fancy or just regularly fancy.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$ denoting a quote.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy" (without quotes).

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 50$
- $1 \le |S| \le 100$
- each character of $S$ is either a lowercase English letter or a space

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
2
i do not have any fancy quotes
when nothing goes right go left

-----Example Output-----
Real Fancy
regularly fancy

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: "i do not have any fancy quotes"
Example case 2: The word "not" does not appear in the given quote.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to classify quotes as "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy" based on whether they contain the word "not". If a quote contains "not", it is classified as "Real Fancy"; otherwise, it is classified as "regularly fancy".

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Read the number of quotes.
   - For each quote, check if the substring "not" is present.
   - Print "Real Fancy" if "not" is found, otherwise print "regularly fancy".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function classify_quotes(T, quotes):
       for each quote in quotes:
           if "not" in quote:
               print "Real Fancy"
           else:
               print "regularly fancy"

   read T
   read quotes
   classify_quotes(T, quotes)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    # Iterate through each quote
    for quote in quotes:
        # Check if the substring "not" is present in the quote

            print("Real Fancy")
        else:
            print("regularly fancy")

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

1. **Understanding the Input and Output Requirements:**
   - We need to classify quotes based on the presence of the word "not".
   - The expected output is "Real Fancy" if the word "not" appears as a standalone word in the quote, and "regularly fancy" otherwise.

2. **Identifying the Issue:**
   - The previous solution checks for the substring "not" in the quote, which can lead to incorrect classifications. For example, if the quote contains "nothing", it will incorrectly classify it as "Real Fancy" because "not" is part of "nothing".
   - We need to ensure that "not" is treated as a separate word, which means we should check for "not" surrounded by spaces or at the beginning or end of the quote.

3. **Where I Went Wrong:**
   - The condition `if "not" in quote:` does not account for the word boundaries. It should check for "not" as a complete word rather than just a substring.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - We can split the quote into words and check if "not" is one of those words. This way, we ensure that we are only looking for "not" as a standalone word.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution based on this understanding.

```python
def classify_quotes(T, quotes):
    # Iterate through each quote
    for quote in quotes:
        # Split the quote into words
        words = quote.split()
        # Check if "not" is in the list of words
        if "not" in words:
            print("Real Fancy")
        else:
            print("regularly fancy")

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input().strip())

quotes = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]

 else:
  print("regularly fancy")

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] In this experience, I learned the importance of checking for word boundaries when searching for specific words in a string. My initial approach incorrectly identified "not" as part of other words (like "nothing"), leading to incorrect classifications. The official solution effectively uses the `split()` method to break the quote into individual words, allowing for a straightforward check of whether "not" is present as a standalone word.

The official solution also employs a loop to handle multiple test cases efficiently, which aligns with the problem requirements. It uses a simple list to store the split words and checks for the presence of "not" in that list. This method is both clear and effective, ensuring that the classification is accurate.

Key insights from the official solution:
- Always consider word boundaries when searching for specific terms in strings.
- Using `split()` to break down a string into words is a reliable way to check for specific terms.
- Iterating through test cases with a loop is a straightforward approach to handle multiple inputs.

Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of careful string manipulation and the need to validate assumptions about input data.
