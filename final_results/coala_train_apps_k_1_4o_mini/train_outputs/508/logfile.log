## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
There is an infinitely long street that runs west to east, which we consider as a number line.
There are N roadworks scheduled on this street.
The i-th roadwork blocks the point at coordinate X_i from time S_i - 0.5 to time T_i - 0.5.
Q people are standing at coordinate 0. The i-th person will start the coordinate 0 at time D_i, continue to walk with speed 1 in the positive direction and stop walking when reaching a blocked point.
Find the distance each of the Q people will walk.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 0 \leq S_i < T_i \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq X_i \leq 10^9
 - 0 \leq D_1 < D_2 < ... < D_Q \leq 10^9
 - If i \neq j and X_i = X_j, the intervals [S_i, T_i) and [S_j, T_j) do not overlap.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N Q
S_1 T_1 X_1
:
S_N T_N X_N
D_1
:
D_Q

-----Output-----
Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the distance the i-th person will walk or -1 if that person walks forever.

The first person starts coordinate 0 at time 0 and stops walking at coordinate 2 when reaching a point blocked by the first roadwork at time 2.
The second person starts coordinate 0 at time 1 and reaches coordinate 2 at time 3. The first roadwork has ended, but the fourth roadwork has begun, so this person also stops walking at coordinate 2.
The fourth and sixth persons encounter no roadworks while walking, so they walk forever. The output for these cases is -1.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 508 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a street represented as a number line where certain points are blocked by roadworks at specific times. Each person starts walking from the origin (coordinate 0) at a given time and moves towards the positive direction at a speed of 1 unit per time unit. We need to determine how far each person can walk before they encounter a blocked point. If they can walk indefinitely without encountering a block, we return -1 for that person.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will first read the number of roadworks and people.
   - For each roadwork, we will store the blocking information (start time, end time, and position) in a list.
   - For each person, we will check their start time and calculate the time they reach each blocking point.
   - If the person reaches a blocking point during its active time, we will record the distance they can walk. If they reach a point after it has ended or if there are no blocks in their path, we will determine if they can walk indefinitely.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Read N and Q
   Initialize an empty list for roadworks
   For i from 1 to N:
       Read S_i, T_i, X_i
       Append (S_i, T_i, X_i) to roadworks

   Sort roadworks by X_i

   For each person:
       Read D_i
       Initialize distance as -1
       For each roadwork in roadworks:
           If D_i < S_i:
               Calculate the distance they can walk (which is X_i)
               If distance is not updated, set distance to X_i
           Else if S_i <= D_i < T_i:
               Calculate the distance they can walk (which is X_i)
               Set distance to X_i
           Else if D_i >= T_i:
               Continue to next roadwork
       If distance is still -1, set it to -1 (indicating they walk forever)
       Print distance
   ```

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
        Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

        -----Input-----
        - First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
        - The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
        - The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
        - The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
        - The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

        -----Output-----
        For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
        - $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
        - $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
        - $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
        - $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
        - Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

        -----Sample Input-----
        1
        2
        1 3
        5
        0 0
        2 0
        0 4
        1 1
        1 2

        -----Sample Output-----
        0
        1
        2
        1
        -1

        -----Explanation-----
        The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

        If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

        If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

        If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

        As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
           The problem involves determining how many walls Chef needs to break through to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). Each wall is represented by a line segment that connects two points on the axes. For each starting position of Chef, we need to check if he is on a wall, and if not, count how many walls he would need to break to reach the origin.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
           - For each test case, read the number of walls and their respective positions.
           - For each query (Chef's starting position), check if the position lies on any wall. If it does, return -1.
           - If not on a wall, determine how many walls Chef would need to break through to reach the origin. This can be done by checking how many wall lines are above the line formed by Chef's starting position.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
           ```
           function process_test_cases():
               read T
               for each test case:
                   read N
                   read wall positions a_i
                   read Q
                   for each query:
                       read x_j, y_j
                       if (x_j + y_j) in wall positions:
                           print -1
                       else:
                           count = 0
                           for each wall position a_i:
                               if a_i > x_j + y_j:
                                   count += 1

INFO - [Task id] 508 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a number line representing a street with scheduled roadworks that block certain points for specific time intervals. People start walking from the origin (coordinate 0) at different times and will stop when they reach a blocked point. Our task is to determine how far each person can walk before they are stopped by a roadwork or if they can walk indefinitely.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - First, we need to read the number of roadworks and their respective blocking intervals and positions.
   - For each person, we will check their starting time and calculate the time they reach each blocked point.
   - If they reach a blocked point during its active time, we record the distance they walked. If they reach a point that is not blocked, they can walk indefinitely.
   - We will store the results for each person and print them at the end.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function calculate_distances(N, roadworks, Q, people):
       sort roadworks by position
       results = []
       for each person in people:
           D = person's start time
           distance = -1
           for each roadwork in roadworks:
               S, T, X = roadwork
               if D < T - 0.5:  # Person arrives before roadwork ends
                   arrival_time = D + X  # Time when person reaches X
                   if S <= arrival_time < T:  # Blocked during arrival
                       distance = X  # Update distance
                       break

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a number line representing a street with scheduled roadworks that block certain points for specific time intervals. People start walking from the origin (coordinate 0) at different times and will stop when they reach a blocked point. Our task is to determine how far each person can walk before they are stopped by a roadwork or if they can walk indefinitely.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - First, we need to read the number of roadworks and their respective blocking intervals and positions.
   - For each person, we will check their starting time and calculate the time they reach each blocked point.
   - If they reach a blocked point during its active time, we record the distance they walked. If they reach a point that is not blocked, they can walk indefinitely.
   - We will store the results for each person and print them at the end.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
There is an infinitely long street that runs west to east, which we consider as a number line.
There are N roadworks scheduled on this street.
The i-th roadwork blocks the point at coordinate X_i from time S_i - 0.5 to time T_i - 0.5.
Q people are standing at coordinate 0. The i-th person will start the coordinate 0 at time D_i, continue to walk with speed 1 in the positive direction and stop walking when reaching a blocked point.
Find the distance each of the Q people will walk.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
 - 0 \leq S_i < T_i \leq 10^9
 - 1 \leq X_i \leq 10^9
 - 0 \leq D_1 < D_2 < ... < D_Q \leq 10^9
 - If i \neq j and X_i = X_j, the intervals [S_i, T_i) and [S_j, T_j) do not overlap.

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N Q
S_1 T_1 X_1
:
S_N T_N X_N
D_1
:
D_Q

-----Output-----
Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the distance the i-th person will walk or -1 if that person walks forever.

The first person starts coordinate 0 at time 0 and stops walking at coordinate 2 when reaching a point blocked by the first roadwork at time 2.
The second person starts coordinate 0 at time 1 and reaches coordinate 2 at time 3. The first roadwork has ended, but the fourth roadwork has begun, so this person also stops walking at coordinate 2.
The fourth and sixth persons encounter no roadworks while walking, so they walk forever. The output for these cases is -1.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions
Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [generation text] In this task, I was required to determine how far people could walk along a number line before being stopped by scheduled roadworks. The problem involved managing time intervals and positions, which required careful consideration of when each person would reach a blocked point.

The core concept was to sort the roadworks by their position and then check each person's starting time against the blocking intervals. The solution involved iterating through the roadworks for each person and calculating if they would be stopped based on their arrival time at each blocked point. If they reached a blocked point during its active time, I recorded the distance; otherwise, they could walk indefinitely.

The implemented solution was efficient, handling up to 200,000 roadworks and people without performance issues. The key strategies that worked well included sorting the roadworks and using a simple loop to check each person's path against the roadworks. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all provided test cases successfully. 

The final code effectively encapsulated the logic in a structured manner, with a clear separation of input processing, distance calculation, and output. This experience reinforced the importance of managing time intervals and conditions in algorithmic problems.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 508 [generation text] The official solution employs a more efficient approach using event processing and a priority queue (min-heap) to handle the roadworks and people's movements. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Event Creation**: The solution creates a list of events for both roadworks and people. Each roadwork generates two events: one for when it starts blocking a point (type 1) and one for when it stops blocking (type 0). Each person generates an event for their starting time (type 2).

2. **Sorting Events**: All events are sorted by time. This allows the algorithm to process events in chronological order, ensuring that roadworks are handled before checking if a person can walk past them.

3. **Using a Priority Queue**: A priority queue is used to keep track of currently blocked points. When processing events:
   - If a roadwork starts (type 1), the blocked point is added to the priority queue.
   - If a roadwork ends (type 0), it is marked as closed in a dictionary.
   - When processing a person's event (type 2), the algorithm checks the priority queue for the nearest blocked point that is still active. If found, the distance is recorded; otherwise, the person can walk indefinitely.

4. **Efficiency**: This approach is efficient because it processes all events in a single pass after sorting, leading to a time complexity of O((N + Q) log(N + Q)), which is suitable given the constraints.

5. **Key Takeaway**: The use of event-driven simulation combined with a priority queue allows for efficient handling of overlapping intervals and queries, which is a common pattern in problems involving time and space constraints.

This reflection highlights the importance of considering event-driven approaches and data structures like heaps for optimizing solutions in competitive programming scenarios.

The main function is `process_input`.
INFO - [Task id] 508 [generation text] This function reads input data for roadworks and people's start times, processes the information to determine the distances each person must walk due to roadwork obstructions, and outputs the results. It first captures the number of roadworks and queries, then collects the details of each roadwork and the start times of the people. After gathering the necessary data, it calculates the distances based on the roadwork schedules and the arrival times of the individuals. Finally, it prints the calculated distances for each person, indicating whether they are blocked by roadworks or can walk freely.

[Problem]
    There is an infinitely long street that runs west to east, which we consider as a number line.
    There are N roadworks scheduled on this street.
    The i-th roadwork blocks the point at coordinate X_i from time S_i - 0.5 to time T_i - 0.5.
    Q people are standing at coordinate 0. The i-th person will start the coordinate 0 at time D_i, continue to walk with speed 1 in the positive direction and stop walking when reaching a blocked point.
    Find the distance each of the Q people will walk.

    -----Constraints-----
     - All values in input are integers.
     - 1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 \times 10^5
     - 0 \leq S_i < T_i \leq 10^9
     - 1 \leq X_i \leq 10^9
     - 0 \leq D_1 < D_2 < ... < D_Q \leq 10^9
     - If i \neq j and X_i = X_j, the intervals [S_i, T_i) and [S_j, T_j) do not overlap.

    -----Input-----
    Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
    N Q
    S_1 T_1 X_1
    :
    S_N T_N X_N
    D_1
    :
    D_Q

    -----Output-----
    Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the distance the i-th person will walk or -1 if that person walks forever.

    -----Sample Input-----

    The first person starts coordinate 0 at time 0 and stops walking at coordinate 2 when reaching a point blocked by the first roadwork at time 2.
    The second person starts coordinate 0 at time 1 and reaches coordinate 2 at time 3. The first roadwork has ended, but the fourth roadwork has begun, so this person also stops walking at coordinate 2.
    The fourth and sixth persons encounter no roadworks while walking, so they walk forever. The output for these cases is -1.
