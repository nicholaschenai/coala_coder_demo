    "summary": "In this task, I was required to determine how far people could walk along a number line before being stopped by scheduled roadworks. The problem involved managing time intervals and positions, which required careful consideration of when each person would reach a blocked point.\n\nThe core concept was to sort the roadworks by their position and then check each person's starting time against the blocking intervals. The solution involved iterating through the roadworks for each person and calculating if they would be stopped based on their arrival time at each blocked point. If they reached a blocked point during its active time, I recorded the distance; otherwise, they could walk indefinitely.\n\nThe implemented solution was efficient, handling up to 200,000 roadworks and people without performance issues. The key strategies that worked well included sorting the roadworks and using a simple loop to check each person's path against the roadworks. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all provided test cases successfully. \n\nThe final code effectively encapsulated the logic in a structured manner, with a clear separation of input processing, distance calculation, and output. This experience reinforced the importance of managing time intervals and conditions in algorithmic problems.",
    "reflection": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach using event processing and a priority queue (min-heap) to handle the roadworks and people's movements. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Event Creation**: The solution creates a list of events for both roadworks and people. Each roadwork generates two events: one for when it starts blocking a point (type 1) and one for when it stops blocking (type 0). Each person generates an event for their starting time (type 2).\n\n2. **Sorting Events**: All events are sorted by time. This allows the algorithm to process events in chronological order, ensuring that roadworks are handled before checking if a person can walk past them.\n\n3. **Using a Priority Queue**: A priority queue is used to keep track of currently blocked points. When processing events:\n   - If a roadwork starts (type 1), the blocked point is added to the priority queue.\n   - If a roadwork ends (type 0), it is marked as closed in a dictionary.\n   - When processing a person's event (type 2), the algorithm checks the priority queue for the nearest blocked point that is still active. If found, the distance is recorded; otherwise, the person can walk indefinitely.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: This approach is efficient because it processes all events in a single pass after sorting, leading to a time complexity of O((N + Q) log(N + Q)), which is suitable given the constraints.\n\n5. **Key Takeaway**: The use of event-driven simulation combined with a priority queue allows for efficient handling of overlapping intervals and queries, which is a common pattern in problems involving time and space constraints.\n\nThis reflection highlights the importance of considering event-driven approaches and data structures like heaps for optimizing solutions in competitive programming scenarios.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: process_input]\nThis function reads input data for roadworks and people's start times, processes the information to determine the distances each person must walk due to roadwork obstructions, and outputs the results. It first captures the number of roadworks and queries, then collects the details of each roadwork and the start times of the people. After gathering the necessary data, it calculates the distances based on the roadwork schedules and the arrival times of the individuals. Finally, it prints the calculated distances for each person, indicating whether they are blocked by roadworks or can walk freely.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios involving scheduling and planning where multiple events (like roadworks) can block paths for individuals (like people walking). It can be applied in traffic management systems, logistics for delivery services, or any situation where movement is restricted by time-sensitive obstacles. Understanding how to calculate the distance traveled before encountering a blockage can help in optimizing routes and improving efficiency in various fields such as urban planning, transportation, and event management."
