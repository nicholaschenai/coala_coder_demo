But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.\n        Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.\n\n        -----Input-----\n        - First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.\n        - The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.\n        - The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.\n        - The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.\n        - The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.\n\n        -----Output-----\n        For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.\n\n        -----Constraints-----\n        - $1 \\leq T \\leq 2 * 10^2$\n        - $1 \\leq N, Q \\leq 2 * 10^5$\n        - $1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$\n        - $0 \\leq x_j, y_j \\leq 10^9$\n        - $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$\n        - Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$\n\n        -----Sample Input-----\n        1\n        2\n        1 3\n        5\n        0 0\n        2 0\n        0 4\n        1 1\n        1 2\n\n        -----Sample Output-----\n        0\n        1\n        2\n        1\n        -1\n\n        -----Explanation-----\n        The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:\n\n        If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.\n\n        If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.\n\n        If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.\n\n        If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.\n\n        As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        None\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n           The problem involves determining how many walls Chef needs to break through to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). Each wall is represented by a line segment that connects two points on the axes. For each starting position of Chef, we need to check if he is on a wall, and if not, count how many walls he would need to break to reach the origin.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n           - For each test case, read the number of walls and their respective positions.\n           - For each query (Chef's starting position), check if the position lies on any wall. If it does, return -1.\n           - If not on a wall, determine how many walls Chef would need to break through to reach the origin.

The problem involved managing time intervals and positions, which required careful consideration of when each person would reach a blocked point.\n\nThe core concept was to sort the roadworks by their position and then check each person's starting time against the blocking intervals. The solution involved iterating through the roadworks for each person and calculating if they would be stopped based on their arrival time at each blocked point. If they reached a blocked point during its active time, I recorded the distance; otherwise, they could walk indefinitely.\n\nThe implemented solution was efficient, handling up to 200,000 roadworks and people without performance issues. The key strategies that worked well included sorting the roadworks and using a simple loop to check each person's path against the roadworks. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all provided test cases successfully. \n\nThe final code effectively encapsulated the logic in a structured manner, with a clear separation of input processing, distance calculation, and output. This experience reinforced the importance of managing time intervals and conditions in algorithmic problems."

        "content": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach using event processing and a priority queue (min-heap) to handle the roadworks and people's movements. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Event Creation**: The solution creates a list of events for both roadworks and people. Each roadwork generates two events: one for when it starts blocking a point (type 1) and one for when it stops blocking (type 0). Each person generates an event for their starting time (type 2).\n\n2. **Sorting Events**: All events are sorted by time. This allows the algorithm to process events in chronological order, ensuring that roadworks are handled before checking if a person can walk past them.\n\n3. **Using a Priority Queue**: A priority queue is used to keep track of currently blocked points. When processing events:\n   - If a roadwork starts (type 1), the blocked point is added to the priority queue.\n   - If a roadwork ends (type 0), it is marked as closed in a dictionary.\n   - When processing a person's event (type 2), the algorithm checks the priority queue for the nearest blocked point that is still active. If found, the distance is recorded; otherwise, the person can walk indefinitely.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: This approach is efficient because it processes all events in a single pass after sorting, leading to a time complexity of O((N + Q) log(N + Q)), which is suitable given the constraints.\n\n5. **Key Takeaway**: The use of event-driven simulation combined with a priority queue allows for efficient handling of overlapping intervals and queries, which is a common pattern in problems involving time and space constraints.\n\nThis reflection highlights the importance of considering event-driven approaches and data structures like heaps for optimizing solutions in competitive programming scenarios."

        "content": "\n[description for function: process_input]\nThis function reads input data for roadworks and people's start times, processes the information to determine the distances each person must walk due to roadwork obstructions, and outputs the results. It first captures the number of roadworks and queries, then collects the details of each roadwork and the start times of the people. After gathering the necessary data, it calculates the distances based on the roadwork schedules and the arrival times of the individuals. Finally, it prints the calculated distances for each person, indicating whether they are blocked by roadworks or can walk freely.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios involving scheduling and planning where multiple events (like roadworks) can block paths for individuals (like people walking). It can be applied in traffic management systems, logistics for delivery services, or any situation where movement is restricted by time-sensitive obstacles. Understanding how to calculate the distance traveled before encountering a blockage can help in optimizing routes and improving efficiency in various fields such as urban planning, transportation, and event management."
