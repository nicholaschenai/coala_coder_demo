    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We have a number line representing a street with scheduled roadworks that block certain points for specific time intervals. People start walking from the origin (coordinate 0) at different times and will stop when they reach a blocked point. Our task is to determine how far each person can walk before they are stopped by a roadwork or if they can walk indefinitely.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - First, we need to read the number of roadworks and their respective blocking intervals and positions.\n   - For each person, we will check their starting time and calculate the time they reach each blocked point.\n   - If they reach a blocked point during its active time, we record the distance they walked. If they reach a point that is not blocked, they can walk indefinitely.\n   - We will store the results for each person and print them at the end.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function calculate_distances(N, roadworks, Q, people):\n       sort roadworks by position\n       results = []\n       for each person in people:\n           D = person's start time\n           distance = -1\n           for each roadwork in roadworks:\n               S, T, X = roadwork\n               if D < T - 0.5:  # Person arrives before roadwork ends\n                   arrival_time = D + X  # Time when person reaches X\n                   if S <= arrival_time < T:  # Blocked during arrival\n                       distance = X  # Update distance\n                       break\n           results.append(distance)\n       return results\n\n   function process_input():\n       read N and Q\n       read roadworks\n       read people\n       results = calculate_distances(N, roadworks, Q, people)\n       print results\n\n   main():\n       process_input()\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef calculate_distances(N, roadworks, Q, people):\n    # Sort roadworks by position\n    roadworks.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])  # Sort by X_i\n    results = []\n    \n    for D in people:\n        distance = -1  # Default to -1 (walks forever)\n        for S, T, X in roadworks:\n            if D < T - 0.5:  # Person arrives before roadwork ends\n                arrival_time = D + X  # Time when person reaches X\n                if S <= arrival_time < T:  # Blocked during arrival\n                    distance = X  # Update distance\n                    break  # Stop checking further roadworks\n        results.append(distance)\n    \n    return results\n\ndef process_input():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    # Read N and Q\n    N, Q = map(int, data[0].split())\n    roadworks = []\n    \n    # Read roadworks\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        S, T, X = map(int, data[i].split())\n        roadworks.append((S, T, X))\n    \n    # Read people's start times\n    people = []\n    for i in range(N + 1, N + 1 + Q):\n        D = int(data[i])\n        people.append(D)\n    \n    # Get results for distances\n    results = calculate_distances(N, roadworks, Q, people)\n    \n    # Print all results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Call the function to process input and output results\nprocess_input()\n```",
