The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.\n\nGildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.\n\nEach customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ \u2014 the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ \u2014 the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ \u2014 the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.\n\nA customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.\n\nGiven the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$, $-10^9 \\le m \\le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.\n\nNext, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \\le t_i \\le 10^9$, $-10^9 \\le l_i \\le h_i \\le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.\n\nThe customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n3 0\n5 1 2\n7 3 5\n10 -1 0\n2 12\n5 7 10\n10 16 20\n3 -100\n100 0 0\n100 -50 50\n200 100 100\n1 100\n99 -100 0\n\nOutput\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. \n\nIn the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.\n\nIn the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Each customer has a specific time they will arrive and a preferred temperature range. The restaurant has an air conditioner that can either heat, cool, or maintain the current temperature. The goal is to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature to meet the preferences of all customers based on their arrival times.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   We need to track the temperature range that can be achieved by the time each customer arrives. Starting from the initial temperature, we will calculate how much time has passed since the last customer and adjust the temperature range accordingly. For each customer, we will check if the current achievable temperature range overlaps with their preferred range. If it does, we will update the achievable range for the next customer based on the time until their arrival. If at any point the ranges do not overlap, we will conclude that it is impossible to satisfy all customers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function canSatisfyCustomers(test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read n, m\n           current_time = 0\n           min_temp = m\n           max_temp = m\n           \n           for each customer in test_case:\n               t_i, l_i, h_i = customer\n               time_passed = t_i - current_time\n               \n               # Update the temperature range based on time passed\n               min_temp -= time_passed\n               max_temp += time_passed\n               \n               # Update the achievable range to be within the customer's range\n               min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)\n               max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)\n               \n               # If the ranges do not overlap, it's impossible\n               if min_temp > max_temp:\n                   print(\"NO\")\n                   break\n               \n               current_time = t_i\n           else:\n               print(\"YES\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef canSatisfyCustomers(test_cases):\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        # Read number of customers and initial temperature\n        n, m = test_case[0]\n        current_time = 0\n        min_temp = m\n        max_temp = m\n        \n        # Iterate through each customer\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            t_i, l_i, h_i = test_case[i]\n            time_passed = t_i - current_time\n            \n            # Update the temperature range based on time passed\n            min_temp -= time_passed\n            max_temp += time_passed\n            \n            # Update the achievable range to be within the customer's range\n            min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)\n            max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)\n            \n            # If the ranges do not overlap, it's impossible\n            if min_temp > max_temp:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                break\n            \n            current_time = t_i\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# canSatisfyCustomers([\n#     [(3, 0), (5, 1, 2), (7, 3, 5), (10, -1, 0)],\n#     [(2, 12), (5, 7, 10), (10, 16, 20)],\n#     [(3, -100), (100, 0, 0), (100, -50, 50), (200, 100, 100)],\n#     [(1, 100), (99, -100, 0)]\n# ])\n```"

The key requirements were that the total demand from the minions must equal the amount of money Gru has (K), and no individual demand should exceed K.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    1. **Total Demand vs. Available Money**: The primary check is whether the sum of all demands equals K.\n    2. **Individual Demand Check**: Each minion's demand must not exceed K, but this check was not necessary for the problem as stated since the total demand check suffices.\n\n    ### Attempts and Errors:\n    - The initial implementation correctly calculated the total demand but failed to produce the expected output due to misunderstanding the problem requirements. The output was \"NO\" for cases where it should have been \"YES\".\n    - The logic was simplified to only check if the total demand matched K, which was the correct approach. However, I mistakenly added unnecessary checks that complicated the solution.\n\n    ### Final Working Code:\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case[0], case[1]\n            demands = case[2]\n            total_demand = sum(demands)\n            if total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    # Read input\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        demands = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, demands))\n\n    can_distribute_money(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    ### Conclusion:\n    The main takeaway is to focus on the problem requirements and ensure that the logic aligns with those requirements. The final solution effectively checks if the total demand matches the available money, which is the crux of the problem.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The solution starts by reading the number of test cases and initializing the current temperature range (`now`) to the initial temperature for both the minimum and maximum.\n\n2. **Iterating through Customers**: For each customer, the solution calculates the time elapsed since the last customer and adjusts the current temperature range accordingly. This is done by subtracting the elapsed time from the minimum temperature and adding it to the maximum temperature.\n\n3. **Range Checking**: The solution checks if the adjusted temperature range overlaps with the customer's preferred range. If there is no overlap, it sets a flag to indicate that not all customers can be satisfied.\n\n4. **Updating the Range**: If there is an overlap, the solution updates the current achievable temperature range to reflect the intersection of the current range and the customer's preferred range.\n\n5. **Final Output**: After processing all customers, the solution prints \"YES\" if all customers can be satisfied and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n### Key Differences from My Approach:\n- The official solution uses a tuple to maintain the current temperature range, which simplifies the logic for updating and checking ranges.\n- It directly checks for overlaps and updates the range in a more concise manner, reducing the number of variables and conditions needed.\n- The use of a flag to track the possibility of satisfying all customers is a straightforward approach that clearly indicates the outcome.\n\nOverall, the official solution is efficient and clear, demonstrating a solid understanding of how to manage dynamic ranges in a time-sensitive context. This experience reinforces the importance of maintaining clarity in variable management and range checking when dealing with overlapping intervals."
