    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   Gildong runs a restaurant and wants to ensure that the temperature is suitable for all customers who have made reservations. Each customer has a specific time they will arrive and a temperature range they prefer. The air conditioner can either heat, cool, or remain off, and it starts off. The challenge is to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature to meet all customers' preferences at their respective arrival times.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   We need to track the temperature range that can be achieved at each customer's arrival time. Starting from the initial temperature, we will calculate how much time has passed since the last customer and adjust the temperature range accordingly. For each customer, we will check if the current achievable temperature range overlaps with their preferred range. If it does for all customers, we can satisfy them; otherwise, we cannot.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function can_satisfy_customers(test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read n (number of customers) and m (initial temperature)\n           current_time = 0\n           current_min_temp = m\n           current_max_temp = m\n           \n           for each customer in test_case:\n               read t_i, l_i, h_i (arrival time and preferred temperature range)\n               time_passed = t_i - current_time\n               \n               # Update the current temperature range\n               current_min_temp -= time_passed\n               current_max_temp += time_passed\n               \n               # Update the current time\n               current_time = t_i\n               \n               # Find the intersection of the current range and the customer's range\n               current_min_temp = max(current_min_temp, l_i)\n               current_max_temp = min(current_max_temp, h_i)\n               \n               # If the ranges do not overlap, it's impossible to satisfy this customer\n               if current_min_temp > current_max_temp:\n                   print(\"NO\")\n                   break\n           else:\n               print(\"YES\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef can_satisfy_customers(test_cases):\n    for case in test_cases:\n        n, m = case[0], case[1]  # number of customers and initial temperature\n        current_time = 0\n        current_min_temp = m\n        current_max_temp = m\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            t_i, l_i, h_i = case[2][i]  # customer visit time and preferred temperature range\n            time_passed = t_i - current_time\n            \n            # Update the current temperature range based on time passed\n            current_min_temp -= time_passed\n            current_max_temp += time_passed\n            \n            # Update the current time to the customer's visit time\n            current_time = t_i\n            \n            # Adjust the current temperature range to the customer's preferred range\n            current_min_temp = max(current_min_temp, l_i)\n            current_max_temp = min(current_max_temp, h_i)\n            \n            # If the ranges do not overlap, print \"NO\" and break\n            if current_min_temp > current_max_temp:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                break\n        else:\n            # If all customers can be satisfied, print \"YES\"\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n# Read input\nq = int(input())  # number of test cases\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(q):\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())  # number of customers and initial temperature\n    customers = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]  # customer data\n    test_cases.append((n, m, customers))\n\ncan_satisfy_customers(test_cases)\n```",
