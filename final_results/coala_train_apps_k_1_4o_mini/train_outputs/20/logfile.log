## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.

Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.

The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.

Each customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ â€” the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ â€” the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ â€” the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.

A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.

Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.


-----Input-----

Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $-10^9 \le m \le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.

Next, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^9$, $-10^9 \le l_i \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.

The customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Example-----
Input
4
3 0
5 1 2
7 3 5
10 -1 0
2 12
5 7 10
10 16 20
3 -100
100 0 0
100 -50 50
200 100 100
1 100
99 -100 0

Output
YES
NO
YES
NO



-----Note-----

In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. 

In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.

In the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 20 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Gildong runs a bulgogi restaurant and wants to ensure that all customers are satisfied with the temperature when they arrive. Each customer has a specific time they will arrive and a preferred temperature range. The restaurant has an air conditioner that can either heat, cool, or maintain the current temperature. The goal is to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature to meet the preferences of all customers based on their arrival times.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   We need to track the temperature range that can be achieved by the time each customer arrives. Starting from the initial temperature, we will calculate how much time has passed since the last customer and adjust the temperature range accordingly. For each customer, we will check if the current achievable temperature range overlaps with their preferred range. If it does, we will update the achievable range for the next customer based on the time until their arrival. If at any point the ranges do not overlap, we will conclude that it is impossible to satisfy all customers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function canSatisfyCustomers(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read n, m
           current_time = 0
           min_temp = m
           max_temp = m
           
           for each customer in test_case:
               t_i, l_i, h_i = customer
               time_passed = t_i - current_time
               
               # Update the temperature range based on time passed
               min_temp -= time_passed
               max_temp += time_passed
               
               # Update the achievable range to be within the customer's range
               min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)
               max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)
               
               # If the ranges do not overlap, it's impossible
               if min_temp > max_temp:
                   print("NO")
                   break

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money exactly according to the demands of the minions. The key requirements were that the total demand from the minions must equal the amount of money Gru has (K), and no individual demand should exceed K.

    ### Key Concepts:
    1. **Total Demand vs. Available Money**: The primary check is whether the sum of all demands equals K.
    2. **Individual Demand Check**: Each minion's demand must not exceed K, but this check was not necessary for the problem as stated since the total demand check suffices.

    ### Attempts and Errors:
    - The initial implementation correctly calculated the total demand but failed to produce the expected output due to misunderstanding the problem requirements. The output was "NO" for cases where it should have been "YES".
    - The logic was simplified to only check if the total demand matched K, which was the correct approach. However, I mistakenly added unnecessary checks that complicated the solution.

    ### Final Working Code:
    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case[0], case[1]
            demands = case[2]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
            if total_demand == K:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read input
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        demands = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, K, demands))

    can_distribute_money(T, test_cases)
    ```

    ### Conclusion:
    The main takeaway is to focus on the problem requirements and ensure that the logic aligns with those requirements. The final solution effectively checks if the total demand matches the available money, which is the crux of the problem.

INFO - [Task id] 20 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Gildong runs a restaurant and wants to ensure that the temperature is suitable for all customers who have made reservations. Each customer has a specific time they will arrive and a temperature range they prefer. The air conditioner can either heat, cool, or remain off, and it starts off. The challenge is to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature to meet all customers' preferences at their respective arrival times.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   We need to track the temperature range that can be achieved at each customer's arrival time. Starting from the initial temperature, we will calculate how much time has passed since the last customer and adjust the temperature range accordingly. For each customer, we will check if the current achievable temperature range overlaps with their preferred range. If it does for all customers, we can satisfy them; otherwise, we cannot.

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Gildong runs a restaurant and wants to ensure that the temperature is suitable for all customers who have made reservations. Each customer has a specific time they will arrive and a temperature range they prefer. The air conditioner can either heat, cool, or remain off, and it starts off. The challenge is to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature to meet all customers' preferences at their respective arrival times.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   We need to track the temperature range that can be achieved at each customer's arrival time. Starting from the initial temperature, we will calculate how much time has passed since the last customer and adjust the temperature range accordingly. For each customer, we will check if the current achievable temperature range overlaps with their preferred range. If it does for all customers, we can satisfy them; otherwise, we cannot.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_satisfy_customers(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read n (number of customers) and m (initial temperature)
           current_time = 0
           current_min_temp = m
           current_max_temp = m
           
           for each customer in test_case:
               read t_i, l_i, h_i (arrival time and preferred temperature range)
               time_passed = t_i - current_time
               
               # Update the current temperature range
               current_min_temp -= time_passed
               current_max_temp += time_passed
               
               # Update the current time
               current_time = t_i
               
               # Find the intersection of the current range and the customer's range
               current_min_temp = max(current_min_temp, l_i)
               current_max_temp = min(current_max_temp, h_i)
               
               # If the ranges do not overlap, it's impossible to satisfy this customer
               if current_min_temp > current_max_temp:
                   print("NO")
                   break

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.

Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.

The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.

Each customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ â€” the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ â€” the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ â€” the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.

A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.

Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.


-----Input-----

Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $-10^9 \le m \le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.

Next, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^9$, $-10^9 \le l_i \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.

The customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print "NO".

You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


-----Example-----
Input
4
3 0
5 1 2

100 -50 50
200 100 100
1 100
99 -100 0

Output
YES
NO
YES
NO



-----Note-----

In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. 

In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.

In the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 20 [generation text] In this problem, the main challenge was to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature of a restaurant to satisfy all customers based on their preferred temperature ranges at specific arrival times. The solution involved tracking the current achievable temperature range and updating it based on the time elapsed since the last customer.

The core concept was to maintain a range of possible temperatures that could be achieved by the air conditioner, which can either heat, cool, or remain off. For each customer, we calculated the time passed since the last customer and adjusted the temperature range accordingly. We then checked if the current range overlapped with the customer's preferred range. If at any point the ranges did not overlap, it was impossible to satisfy that customer.

The implemented solution was efficient and handled multiple test cases as required. The final code successfully passed all provided test cases, demonstrating that the approach was correct. The key takeaway was the importance of managing state changes over time and ensuring that the temperature adjustments were feasible within the constraints given by each customer's preferences. 

The final code snippet is as follows:

```python
def can_satisfy_customers(test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        n, m = case[0], case[1]  # number of customers and initial temperature
        current_time = 0
        current_min_temp = m
        current_max_temp = m
        
        for i in range(n):
            t_i, l_i, h_i = case[2][i]  # customer visit time and preferred temperature range
            time_passed = t_i - current_time
            
            # Update the current temperature range based on time passed
            current_min_temp -= time_passed
            current_max_temp += time_passed
            
            # Update the current time to the customer's visit time
            current_time = t_i
            
            # Adjust the current temperature range to the customer's preferred range
            current_min_temp = max(current_min_temp, l_i)
            current_max_temp = min(current_max_temp, h_i)
            
            # If the ranges do not overlap, print "NO" and break
            if current_min_temp > current_max_temp:
                print("NO")
                break
        else:
            # If all customers can be satisfied, print "YES"
            print("YES")

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.

Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.

In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. 

In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.

In the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.

INFO - [Task id] 20 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Gildong runs a restaurant and wants to ensure that the temperature is suitable for all customers who have made reservations. Each customer has a specific time they will arrive and a temperature range they prefer. The air conditioner can either heat, cool, or remain off, and it starts off. The challenge is to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature to meet all customers' preferences at their respective arrival times.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   We need to track the temperature range that can be achieved at each customer's arrival time. Starting from the initial temperature, we will calculate how much time has passed since the last customer and adjust the temperature range accordingly. For each customer, we will check if the current achievable temperature range overlaps with their preferred range. If it does for all customers, we can satisfy them; otherwise, we cannot.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_satisfy_customers(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read n (number of customers) and m (initial temperature)
           current_time = 0
           current_min_temp = m
           current_max_temp = m
           
           for each customer in test_case:
               read t_i, l_i, h_i (arrival time and preferred temperature range)
               time_passed = t_i - current_time
               
               # Update the current temperature range
               current_min_temp -= time_passed
               current_max_temp += time_passed
               
               # Update the current time
               current_time = t_i
               
               # Find the intersection of the current range and the customer's range
               current_min_temp = max(current_min_temp, l_i)
               current_max_temp = min(current_max_temp, h_i)
               
               # If the ranges do not overlap, it's impossible to satisfy this customer
               if current_min_temp > current_max_temp:
                   print("NO")
                   break
           else:
               print("YES")

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
q = int(input())
for _ in range(q):
    n, m = list(map(int, input().split()))
    info = [list(map(int, input().split())) for i in range(n)]
    info = sorted(info)

    time = 0
    flag = True
    for i in range(n):
        t, l, h = info[i]
        l_now = now[0] - (t - time)
        h_now = now[1] + (t - time)
        time = t
        if h < l_now or h_now < l:
            flag = False
        else:
            l_now = max(l_now, l)
            h_now = min(h_now, h)
            now = (l_now, h_now)
    if flag:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

INFO - [Task id] 20 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem by maintaining a dynamic range of achievable temperatures as customers arrive. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:

1. **Initialization**: The solution starts by reading the number of test cases and initializing the current temperature range (`now`) to the initial temperature for both the minimum and maximum.

2. **Iterating through Customers**: For each customer, the solution calculates the time elapsed since the last customer and adjusts the current temperature range accordingly. This is done by subtracting the elapsed time from the minimum temperature and adding it to the maximum temperature.

3. **Range Checking**: The solution checks if the adjusted temperature range overlaps with the customer's preferred range. If there is no overlap, it sets a flag to indicate that not all customers can be satisfied.

4. **Updating the Range**: If there is an overlap, the solution updates the current achievable temperature range to reflect the intersection of the current range and the customer's preferred range.

5. **Final Output**: After processing all customers, the solution prints "YES" if all customers can be satisfied and "NO" otherwise.

### Key Differences from My Approach:
- The official solution uses a tuple to maintain the current temperature range, which simplifies the logic for updating and checking ranges.
- It directly checks for overlaps and updates the range in a more concise manner, reducing the number of variables and conditions needed.
- The use of a flag to track the possibility of satisfying all customers is a straightforward approach that clearly indicates the outcome.

Overall, the official solution is efficient and clear, demonstrating a solid understanding of how to manage dynamic ranges in a time-sensitive context. This experience reinforces the importance of maintaining clarity in variable management and range checking when dealing with overlapping intervals.

[Problem]
    Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.

    Gildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.

    The restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.

    Each customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ â€” the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ â€” the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ â€” the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.

    A customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.

    Given the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.


    -----Input-----

    Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \le q \le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.

    The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100$, $-10^9 \le m \le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.

    Next, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^9$, $-10^9 \le l_i \le h_i \le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.

    The customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.


    -----Output-----

    For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print "NO".

    You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).


    -----Example-----
    Input
    4
    3 0
    5 1 2

    1 100
    99 -100 0

    Output
    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO



    -----Note-----

    In the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. 

    In the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.

    In the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.
