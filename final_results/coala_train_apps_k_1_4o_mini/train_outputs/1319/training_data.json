    "summary": "In this task, I was required to implement a solution for a problem involving a king who beheads the richest citizen after each of his visits to the court. The challenge was to efficiently track the wealth of citizens and identify the richest one who had not been beheaded yet.\n\nThe core concept tested here was the ability to manage a dynamic list of citizens' wealth while efficiently finding the maximum value during each of the king's visits. I used a list to store the wealth and a set to track which citizens had been beheaded. The approach involved iterating through the wealth list to find the richest citizen during each visit, which worked well for the given constraints.\n\nOne potential inefficiency in the solution was the linear search for the richest citizen during each visit, which could be improved with a more sophisticated data structure like a max-heap. However, given the constraints and the simplicity of the problem, the implemented solution was sufficient.\n\nThe final code successfully handled the input and produced the correct output, demonstrating that the approach was effective for the problem at hand. The solution is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef find_richest_citizens():\n    wealth_list = []\n    beheaded = set()\n    N, M = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    for _ in range(N + M):\n        line = input().strip()\n        if line == '-1':\n            richest_wealth = -1\n            richest_index = -1\n            \n            for index, wealth in enumerate(wealth_list):\n                if index not in beheaded and wealth > richest_wealth:\n                    richest_wealth = wealth\n                    richest_index = index\n            \n            beheaded.add(richest_index)\n            print(richest_wealth)\n        else:\n            wealth_list.append(int(line))\n\nfind_richest_citizens()\n``` \n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of understanding data structures and their implications on performance, especially in scenarios involving frequent updates and queries.",
    "reflection": "The official solution effectively addresses the problem by maintaining a list of citizens' wealth and using a straightforward approach to find the richest citizen during each of the king's visits. Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Data Structure**: The official solution uses a list `l` to store the wealth of citizens. This is similar to my approach, but it also keeps track of the length of the list with the variable `leng`, which helps avoid unnecessary checks on indices that are out of bounds.\n\n2. **Finding the Richest Citizen**: During each king's visit (indicated by `-1`), the solution iterates through the list of wealth to find the maximum wealth (`cm`) and its index (`mi`). This is a linear search, which is simple but can be inefficient for large inputs. My approach also used a linear search, but I did not optimize the tracking of beheaded citizens effectively.\n\n3. **Marking Beheaded Citizens**: The official solution marks a citizen as beheaded by setting their wealth in the list to `-1`. This allows the program to keep the original list intact while still being able to identify who has been beheaded. In my solution, I used a separate set to track beheaded citizens, which added complexity.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient in terms of space since it only uses a single list and a couple of variables. My solution, while functional, could be improved by simplifying the tracking of beheaded citizens.\n\nOverall, the official solution is effective and straightforward, leveraging a single list to manage wealth and using simple logic to find and mark the richest citizen. In future implementations, I should consider optimizing the search for the richest citizen, possibly by using a more efficient data structure like a max-heap, which would allow for faster retrieval of the maximum wealth.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: find_richest_citizens]\nThis function manages the wealth of citizens and tracks the richest among them during a series of visits by a king. It initializes a list to store the wealth of citizens and a set to keep track of those who have been beheaded. After reading the number of citizens and king's visits, it processes input lines to either add wealth values or determine the richest citizen not yet beheaded. When the king visits, it identifies the wealthiest citizen, marks them as beheaded, and outputs their wealth. The function continues this process until all inputs are processed. Ultimately, it provides a way to manage and report on the wealth of citizens in a dynamic scenario.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge would be useful in scenarios where there is a need to efficiently manage and retrieve the maximum value from a dynamic list of elements, especially when elements can be removed or marked as inactive. Such situations can arise in various applications, including resource management, priority scheduling, and game development where entities can be eliminated or become inactive over time. The algorithm can also be applied in competitive programming and algorithm design, where maintaining a list of active participants and quickly retrieving the top performer is essential."
