## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A despotic king decided that his kingdom needed to be rid of corruption and disparity. He called his prime minister and ordered that all corrupt citizens be put to death. Moreover, he wanted this done quickly.
The wily prime minister realised that investigating every citizen to decide who was corrupt and who was not was rather difficult. So he decided on the following plan: He ordered all the citizens to appear in the court one by one and declare their wealth.
The king does not sit in the court all the time (he has other important business to attend to - for instance, meet dignitaries from neighbouring kingdoms, spend time with his family â€¦) Whenever the king walks into the court, the prime minister pulls out the richest man who has appeared before the court so far and is still alive and beheads him for being corrupt. Since the rich are more likely to be corrupt, he hopes to get rid of most of the corrupt and the king is happy as he sees his policy being implemented enthusiastically.
Suppose the wealth of the citizens trooping into the court is
1376518911241376518911241\; 3\; 7\; 6\; 5\; 18\;  9\; 11\;  2\; 4
and the king walked in three times: the first time after the first four persons have seen the minister, the second time after the first five persons have seen the minister and, finally after the first nine persons have seen the minister.
At the king's first visit the richest person to have met the minister has wealth $7$ and he would be beheaded. At the second visit, the wealth of the richest person who has met the minister and is still alive has wealth $6$ and so he would be beheaded. At the third visit the richest person to have met the minister who is still alive has wealth $18$ and so he would be beheaded.
You may assume that the input is such that whenever the king walks in, it is always possible to behead someone.
Your aim is to write a program that will enable the prime minister to identify the richest man to have met the minister and who is still alive quickly. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input consists of two numbers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of citizens in the kingdom and M is the number of visits to the court by the king.
The next $N+M$ lines describe the order in which the $N$ citizens' appearances are interleaved with the $M$ visits by the king. A citizen's visit is denoted by a positive integer, signifying his wealth. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth. A visit by the king is denoted by $-1$.

-----Output:-----
Your output should consist of $M$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at the $i^{th}$ visit of the king.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq M \leq 10000$.
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- You may assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs $1 \leq M \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq N \leq 8000$.

INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The king wants to eliminate corrupt citizens based on their wealth. Citizens declare their wealth one by one, and whenever the king visits, the prime minister must identify and behead the richest citizen who has declared their wealth up to that point and is still alive. The input consists of a sequence of wealth declarations and king's visits, and the output should be the wealth of the citizens beheaded during each of the king's visits.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   We need to keep track of the wealth of citizens as they declare it. When the king visits, we need to quickly find the richest citizen who has declared their wealth and has not been beheaded yet. To do this efficiently, we can use a max-heap (or a priority queue) to keep track of the wealth of citizens. Each time a citizen declares their wealth, we add it to the heap. When the king visits, we pop the maximum wealth from the heap, which represents the richest citizen to be beheaded. We also need to ensure that we only consider citizens who are still alive.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize an empty max-heap
   Initialize an empty list for results

   For each input line:
       If the line is a positive integer (wealth):
           Push the wealth into the max-heap
       Else if the line is -1 (king's visit):
           Pop the maximum wealth from the max-heap
           Append this wealth to the results list

   Print each wealth in the results list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
import heapq

def behead_citizens():
    # Read the first line of input to get N and M
    first_line = input().strip().split()
    N = int(first_line[0])
    M = int(first_line[1])
    
    # Initialize a max-heap (using negative values for max-heap simulation)
    max_heap = []
    results = []
    
    # Process each of the next N + M lines
    for _ in range(N + M):
        line = input().strip()
        if line == '-1':
            # King visits, pop the richest citizen from the heap
            richest = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)  # Negate to get the original wealth
            results.append(richest)
        else:
            # Citizen declares their wealth
            wealth = int(line)
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -wealth)  # Negate to simulate max-heap
    
    # Output the results for each king's visit
    for result in results:
        print(result)

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to determine the winner of a billiards game based on the maximum lead achieved by either player over several rounds. The core concepts involved cumulative score tracking, lead calculation, and determining the player with the maximum lead at any point in the game.

    The solution involved initializing cumulative scores for both players, reading the number of rounds, and processing each round's scores. After updating the cumulative scores, I calculated the current lead and checked if it exceeded the maximum lead recorded so far. If it did, I updated the maximum lead and the corresponding winner.

    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test case. The code effectively handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that the results were printed in the specified format. The approach was efficient, with a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of rounds, which is suitable given the constraints. 

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of careful score tracking and lead calculation in competitive scenarios, and the solution was implemented without any unexpected errors. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def find_winner_and_lead():
        cumulative_score_player1 = 0
        cumulative_score_player2 = 0
        max_lead = 0
        winner = 0

        N = int(input())
    
        for _ in range(N):
            scores = input().split()
            score_player1 = int(scores[0])
            score_player2 = int(scores[1])
        
            cumulative_score_player1 += score_player1
            cumulative_score_player2 += score_player2
        
            if cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:
                current_lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2
                current_leader = 1
            else:
                current_lead = cumulative_score_player2 - cumulative_score_player1
                current_leader = 2
        
            if current_lead > max_lead:
                max_lead = current_lead
                winner = current_leader

        print(winner, max_lead)

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A despotic king decided that his kingdom needed to be rid of corruption and disparity. He called his prime minister and ordered that all corrupt citizens be put to death. Moreover, he wanted this done quickly.
The wily prime minister realised that investigating every citizen to decide who was corrupt and who was not was rather difficult. So he decided on the following plan: He ordered all the citizens to appear in the court one by one and declare their wealth.
The king does not sit in the court all the time (he has other important business to attend to - for instance, meet dignitaries from neighbouring kingdoms, spend time with his family â€¦) Whenever the king walks into the court, the prime minister pulls out the richest man who has appeared before the court so far and is still alive and beheads him for being corrupt. Since the rich are more likely to be corrupt, he hopes to get rid of most of the corrupt and the king is happy as he sees his policy being implemented enthusiastically.
Suppose the wealth of the citizens trooping into the court is
1376518911241376518911241\; 3\; 7\; 6\; 5\; 18\;  9\; 11\;  2\; 4
and the king walked in three times: the first time after the first four persons have seen the minister, the second time after the first five persons have seen the minister and, finally after the first nine persons have seen the minister.
At the king's first visit the richest person to have met the minister has wealth $7$ and he would be beheaded. At the second visit, the wealth of the richest person who has met the minister and is still alive has wealth $6$ and so he would be beheaded. At the third visit the richest person to have met the minister who is still alive has wealth $18$ and so he would be beheaded.
You may assume that the input is such that whenever the king walks in, it is always possible to behead someone.
Your aim is to write a program that will enable the prime minister to identify the richest man to have met the minister and who is still alive quickly. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input consists of two numbers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of citizens in the kingdom and M is the number of visits to the court by the king.
The next $N+M$ lines describe the order in which the $N$ citizens' appearances are interleaved with the $M$ visits by the king. A citizen's visit is denoted by a positive integer, signifying his wealth. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth. A visit by the king is denoted by $-1$.

-----Output:-----
Your output should consist of $M$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at the $i^{th}$ visit of the king.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq M \leq 10000$.
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- You may assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs $1 \leq M \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq N \leq 8000$.

INFO - [Task id] 1319 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem involves a king who wants to eliminate corrupt citizens based on their wealth. Citizens declare their wealth one by one, and whenever the king visits, the prime minister must identify and behead the richest citizen who has appeared so far and is still alive. The input consists of the number of citizens and the number of king's visits, followed by a sequence of wealth declarations and king's visits. The output should be the wealth of the citizens beheaded during each of the king's visits.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   We need to keep track of the wealth of citizens as they declare it. When the king visits, we should quickly find the richest citizen who has declared their wealth and has not been beheaded yet. To efficiently manage this, we can use a list to store the wealth of citizens and a variable to keep track of the richest citizen. Each time the king visits, we will find the maximum wealth from the list of declared citizens, mark that citizen as beheaded, and then output their wealth.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize an empty list to store the wealth of citizens
   Initialize an empty set to keep track of beheaded citizens
   Read N and M from input
   For each of the next N + M lines:
       If the line is a positive integer (wealth):
           Append the wealth to the list
       Else if the line is -1 (king's visit):
           Find the maximum wealth from the list of citizens who are not beheaded
           Mark that citizen as beheaded
           Output the wealth of the beheaded citizen
   ```

INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] In this task, I was required to implement a solution for a problem involving a king who beheads the richest citizen after each of his visits to the court. The challenge was to efficiently track the wealth of citizens and identify the richest one who had not been beheaded yet.

The core concept tested here was the ability to manage a dynamic list of citizens' wealth while efficiently finding the maximum value during each of the king's visits. I used a list to store the wealth and a set to track which citizens had been beheaded. The approach involved iterating through the wealth list to find the richest citizen during each visit, which worked well for the given constraints.

One potential inefficiency in the solution was the linear search for the richest citizen during each visit, which could be improved with a more sophisticated data structure like a max-heap. However, given the constraints and the simplicity of the problem, the implemented solution was sufficient.

The final code successfully handled the input and produced the correct output, demonstrating that the approach was effective for the problem at hand. The solution is as follows:

```python
def find_richest_citizens():
    wealth_list = []
    beheaded = set()
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    
    for _ in range(N + M):
        line = input().strip()
        if line == '-1':
            richest_wealth = -1
            richest_index = -1
            
            for index, wealth in enumerate(wealth_list):
                if index not in beheaded and wealth > richest_wealth:
                    richest_wealth = wealth
                    richest_index = index
            
            beheaded.add(richest_index)
            print(richest_wealth)
        else:
            wealth_list.append(int(line))

find_richest_citizens()
``` 

This experience reinforced the importance of understanding data structures and their implications on performance, especially in scenarios involving frequent updates and queries.

INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem by maintaining a list of citizens' wealth and using a straightforward approach to find the richest citizen during each of the king's visits. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Data Structure**: The official solution uses a list `l` to store the wealth of citizens. This is similar to my approach, but it also keeps track of the length of the list with the variable `leng`, which helps avoid unnecessary checks on indices that are out of bounds.

2. **Finding the Richest Citizen**: During each king's visit (indicated by `-1`), the solution iterates through the list of wealth to find the maximum wealth (`cm`) and its index (`mi`). This is a linear search, which is simple but can be inefficient for large inputs. My approach also used a linear search, but I did not optimize the tracking of beheaded citizens effectively.

3. **Marking Beheaded Citizens**: The official solution marks a citizen as beheaded by setting their wealth in the list to `-1`. This allows the program to keep the original list intact while still being able to identify who has been beheaded. In my solution, I used a separate set to track beheaded citizens, which added complexity.

4. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient in terms of space since it only uses a single list and a couple of variables. My solution, while functional, could be improved by simplifying the tracking of beheaded citizens.

Overall, the official solution is effective and straightforward, leveraging a single list to manage wealth and using simple logic to find and mark the richest citizen. In future implementations, I should consider optimizing the search for the richest citizen, possibly by using a more efficient data structure like a max-heap, which would allow for faster retrieval of the maximum wealth.

    and the king walked in three times: the first time after the first four persons have seen the minister, the second time after the first five persons have seen the minister and, finally after the first nine persons have seen the minister.
    At the king's first visit the richest person to have met the minister has wealth $7$ and he would be beheaded. At the second visit, the wealth of the richest person who has met the minister and is still alive has wealth $6$ and so he would be beheaded. At the third visit the richest person to have met the minister who is still alive has wealth $18$ and so he would be beheaded.
    You may assume that the input is such that whenever the king walks in, it is always possible to behead someone.
    Your aim is to write a program that will enable the prime minister to identify the richest man to have met the minister and who is still alive quickly. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth.

    -----Input:-----
    The first line of the input consists of two numbers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of citizens in the kingdom and M is the number of visits to the court by the king.
    The next $N+M$ lines describe the order in which the $N$ citizens' appearances are interleaved with the $M$ visits by the king. A citizen's visit is denoted by a positive integer, signifying his wealth. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth. A visit by the king is denoted by $-1$.

    -----Output:-----
    Your output should consist of $M$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at the $i^{th}$ visit of the king.

    -----Constraints:-----
    - $1 \leq M \leq 10000$.
    - $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
    - You may assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs $1 \leq M \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq N \leq 8000$.
