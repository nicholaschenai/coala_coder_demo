Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).\nThe difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:\n- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.\n- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.\n- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.\n- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.\nYou should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.\n- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \\dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \\dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.\n\n-----Output-----\nPrint $P$ lines containing one integer each \u2014 the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le P \\le 100,000$\n- $2 \\le S \\le 30$\n- $1 \\le SC_i \\le 100$ for each valid $i$\n- $1 \\le NS_i \\le 1,000$ for each valid $i$\n- in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$\nSubtask #2 (75 points): original constraints\n\n-----Example Input-----\n3 3\n16 24 60\n498 861 589\n14 24 62\n72 557 819\n16 15 69\n435 779 232\n\n-----Example Output-----\n2\n1\n3\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems available and calculating how many contests could be formed based on the required number of problems per contest, while also considering the limited number of days available.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, summing the problems from each setter, and then calculating the number of contests possible by dividing the total problems by the number of problems needed for one contest. The final result for each test case was the minimum of the contests possible and the days available.\n\n    The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the constraints provided. The code was structured to read input, process each test case, and output the results efficiently. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all test cases, demonstrating that the approach was effective. \n\n    Key code snippet:\n    ```python\n    total_problems = sum(A)\n    contests_possible = total_problems // K\n    max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all constraints are considered in the final calculations.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The approach I took was to pair scores with the number of contestants, sort these pairs, and then count the valid indices. This method was efficient given the constraints, particularly since the number of subtasks (S) is relatively small (up to 30), allowing for straightforward comparisons.\n\nThe final implementation was successful, and the code executed correctly without any errors. The key steps included reading input, processing each problem to calculate its difficulty, and sorting the results based on the defined criteria. The solution was structured clearly, with helper functions and main logic separated, which is a good practice for readability and maintainability.

This allows for easy grouping and retrieval of problems with the same difficulty.\n\n3. **Score Calculation**: The solution pairs scores with the number of contestants who solved them using a dictionary (`nsc`). It then sorts the scores and counts how many times the number of contestants solving a subtask is greater than the next subtask. This is done using a simple loop over the sorted scores.\n\n4. **Sorting and Output**: After calculating the scores, the solution sorts the keys of the dictionary (the difficulty counts) and then sorts the problem indices for each difficulty before printing them. This ensures that the output is in the correct order.\n\n5. **Efficiency**: The use of dictionaries and sorting operations is efficient given the constraints, and the overall complexity remains manageable even for the upper limits of the input sizes.\n\nOverall, the official solution is insightful in its use of data structures to simplify the problem of grouping and sorting, which could be a useful approach in similar problems involving categorization and ordering based on computed values."

It pairs the scores with contestants, sorts them, and counts the number of instances where the contestant number decreases as the score increases. The difficulty of each problem is represented as a tuple of this count and the problem index. After processing all problems, it sorts the difficulties and prints the indices of the problems in order of their difficulty. The output provides a ranking of problems based on their difficulty level.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in competitive programming and algorithm design, particularly in problems involving sorting and ranking based on multiple criteria. It can be applied in scenarios where tasks or problems need to be evaluated based on their difficulty or performance metrics, such as in coding contests, educational assessments, or any system that requires the comparison of multiple items based on specific attributes. Understanding how to calculate and sort based on composite keys (like difficulty levels) is a fundamental skill in programming contests and software development."
