## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mandarin chinese
, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

-----Output-----
Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le P \le 100,000$
- $2 \le S \le 30$
- $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
- in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (25 points): $S = 2$
Subtask #2 (75 points): original constraints

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a contest with multiple problems, each having several subtasks. Each subtask has a score and a number of contestants who solved it. We need to determine the difficulty of each problem based on how many times the number of contestants who solved a subtask is greater than the next subtask when the subtasks are sorted by score. The difficulty of a problem is represented as a pair of values: the count of such instances and the problem's index. Finally, we need to sort the problems based on their difficulty and output the indices of the problems in increasing order of difficulty.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Read the number of problems (P) and subtasks (S).
   - For each problem, read the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.
   - Pair the scores with the number of contestants and sort them based on scores.
   - Count how many times the number of contestants who solved a subtask is greater than the next subtask in the sorted list.
   - Store the count and the problem index as a tuple.
   - Sort all problems based on the count first and then by index.
   - Output the sorted indices.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Read P and S
   Initialize an empty list for difficulties
   For each problem from 1 to P:
       Read scores and number of contestants
       Pair scores with contestants and sort by scores
       Initialize count n to 0
       For k from 1 to S-1:
           If contestants[k-1] > contestants[k]:
               Increment n
       Append (n, problem_index) to difficulties
   Sort difficulties by first element (n) and then by second element (problem_index)
   For each difficulty in sorted difficulties:
       Print the problem_index

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mandarin chinese

Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

-----Output-----
Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le P \le 100,000$
- $2 \le S \le 30$

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the problems created by several setters. The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems available and calculating how many contests could be formed based on the required number of problems per contest, while also considering the limited number of days available.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, summing the problems from each setter, and then calculating the number of contests possible by dividing the total problems by the number of problems needed for one contest. The final result for each test case was the minimum of the contests possible and the days available.

    The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the constraints provided. The code was structured to read input, process each test case, and output the results efficiently. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all test cases, demonstrating that the approach was effective. 

    Key code snippet:
    ```python
    total_problems = sum(A)
    contests_possible = total_problems // K
    max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all constraints are considered in the final calculations.

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef is organizing a contest with multiple problems, each having several subtasks. Each subtask has a score and a number of contestants who solved it. The difficulty of each problem is determined by counting how many times the number of contestants who solved a subtask is greater than the next subtask when the subtasks are sorted by score. The goal is to sort the problems based on their difficulty and print the indices of the problems in increasing order of difficulty.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Read the number of problems (P) and the number of subtasks (S).
   - For each problem, read the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.
   - Pair the scores and the number of contestants, then sort the subtasks based on scores.
   - Count the number of valid indices where the number of contestants solving a subtask is greater than the next subtask.
   - Store the difficulty of each problem as a tuple (count, index).
   - Sort the problems based on the difficulty tuples.
   - Print the indices of the problems in the sorted order.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Read P and S
   Initialize an empty list difficulties
   For each problem from 1 to P:
       Read scores and number of contestants

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mandarin chinese
, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
- $2P$ lines follow.

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef is organizing a contest with multiple problems, each having several subtasks. Each subtask has a score and a number of contestants who solved it. The difficulty of each problem is determined by counting how many times the number of contestants who solved a subtask is greater than the next subtask when the subtasks are sorted by score. The goal is to sort the problems based on their difficulty and print the indices of the problems in increasing order of difficulty.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Read the number of problems (P) and the number of subtasks (S).
   - For each problem, read the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask.
   - Pair the scores and the number of contestants, then sort the subtasks based on scores.
   - Count the number of valid indices where the number of contestants solving a subtask is greater than the next subtask.
   - Store the difficulty of each problem as a tuple (count, index).
   - Sort the problems based on the difficulty tuples.
   - Print the indices of the problems in the sorted order.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Read P and S
   Initialize an empty list difficulties
   For each problem from 1 to P:
       Read scores and number of contestants
       Pair scores with contestants
       Sort the pairs by score
       Initialize count to 0
       For k from 0 to S-2:
           If contestants[k] > contestants[k+1]:

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] In this task, I was required to sort problems based on their difficulty, which is determined by the number of valid indices where the number of contestants solving a subtask is greater than the next subtask, after sorting the subtasks by score. The solution involved reading input data, processing it to calculate the difficulty for each problem, and then sorting and outputting the results.

The core concepts tested in this problem included sorting, tuple manipulation, and counting conditions based on comparisons. The approach I took was to pair scores with the number of contestants, sort these pairs, and then count the valid indices. This method was efficient given the constraints, particularly since the number of subtasks (S) is relatively small (up to 30), allowing for straightforward comparisons.

The final implementation was successful, and the code executed correctly without any errors. The key steps included reading input, processing each problem to calculate its difficulty, and sorting the results based on the defined criteria. The solution was structured clearly, with helper functions and main logic separated, which is a good practice for readability and maintainability. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of careful input handling and the effectiveness of sorting and counting techniques in algorithmic problems.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mandarin chinese
, Russian and Vietnamese as well.
Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
- Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
- Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
- Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
- For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $P$ and $S$ denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.
- $2P$ lines follow. For each valid $i$, the $2i-1$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $SC_1, SC_2, \dots, SC_S$ denoting the scores of the $i$-th problem's subtasks, and the $2i$-th of these lines contains $S$ space-separated integers $NS_1, NS_2, \dots, NS_S$ denoting the number of contestants who solved the $i$-th problem's subtasks.

-----Output-----
Print $P$ lines containing one integer each â€” the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le P \le 100,000$
- $2 \le S \le 30$
- $1 \le SC_i \le 100$ for each valid $i$
- $1 \le NS_i \le 1,000$ for each valid $i$
- in each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1164 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem by utilizing a dictionary to group problems by their difficulty scores. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:

1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of problems (p) and subtasks (s) in a single line, which is efficient for handling input.

2. **Using a Dictionary for Grouping**: Instead of maintaining a list of tuples for difficulties, the official solution uses a dictionary (`scores`) where the keys are the difficulty counts and the values are lists of problem indices. This allows for easy grouping and retrieval of problems with the same difficulty.

3. **Score Calculation**: The solution pairs scores with the number of contestants who solved them using a dictionary (`nsc`). It then sorts the scores and counts how many times the number of contestants solving a subtask is greater than the next subtask. This is done using a simple loop over the sorted scores.

4. **Sorting and Output**: After calculating the scores, the solution sorts the keys of the dictionary (the difficulty counts) and then sorts the problem indices for each difficulty before printing them. This ensures that the output is in the correct order.

5. **Efficiency**: The use of dictionaries and sorting operations is efficient given the constraints, and the overall complexity remains manageable even for the upper limits of the input sizes.

Overall, the official solution is insightful in its use of data structures to simplify the problem of grouping and sorting, which could be a useful approach in similar problems involving categorization and ordering based on computed values.

    Chef is organising a contest with $P$ problems (numbered $1$ through $P$). Each problem has $S$ subtasks (numbered $1$ through $S$).
    The difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:
    - Let's denote the score of the $k$-th subtask of this problem by $SC_k$ and the number of contestants who solved it by $NS_k$.
    - Consider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.
    - Calculate the number $n$ of valid indices $k$ such that $NS_k > NS_{k + 1}$.
    - For problem $i$, the difficulty is a pair of integers $(n, i)$.
    You should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem $a$ is more difficult than problem $b$ if the number $n$ is greater for problem $a$ than for problem $b$, or if $a > b$ and $n$ is the same for problems $a$ and $b$.

Understanding how to calculate and sort based on composite keys (like difficulty levels) is a fundamental skill in programming contests and software development.",
