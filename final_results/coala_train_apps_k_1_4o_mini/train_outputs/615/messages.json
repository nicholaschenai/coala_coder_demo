This needs to be done for multiple test cases.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - Read the number of test cases.\n   - For each test case, read the number of bills and the number of queries.\n   - Store the bills in a list.\n   - For each query, calculate the sum of the bills between the two specified indices.

Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the question if they fall within a specified roll number range. \n\n    The approach involved initializing a list of scores for all students, processing each question to update the scores based on the given range and complexity, and finally calculating the mean score.

It uses lists to store the bills and queries.\n\n2. **Direct Summation**: For each query, it directly sums the values between the specified indices using a loop.
