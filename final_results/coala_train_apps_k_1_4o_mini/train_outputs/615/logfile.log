Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 615 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to help Avani answer multiple queries about the sum of values in a list of bills. For each query, we are given two indices, and we need to calculate the sum of the bills from the first index to the second index, inclusive. This needs to be done for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of bills and the number of queries.
   - Store the bills in a list.
   - For each query, calculate the sum of the bills between the two specified indices. Since the indices are 1-based, we need to adjust them to 0-based for Python list indexing.
   - Print the results for each query.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function main():
       read T  // number of test cases
       for each test case from 1 to T:
           read N, Q  // number of bills and number of queries
           read bills as a list of integers
           for each query from 1 to Q:
               read Xi, Yi  // the indices for the query
               sum = 0
               for i from Xi-1 to Yi-1:  // adjust for 0-based index
                   sum += bills[i]
               print sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q
        index += 1
        bills = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read the bills
        index += 1
        
        for __ in range(Q):
            Xi, Yi = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read each query
            index += 1
            
            # Calculate the sum from Xi to Yi (1-based index)
            total_sum = sum(bills[Xi-1:Yi])  # Adjust for 0-based index
            results.append(total_sum)  # Store the result
    
    # Print all results for each query
    for result in results:
        print(result)

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to compute the mean of maximum scores for students after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the question if they fall within a specified roll number range. 

    The approach involved initializing a list of scores for all students, processing each question to update the scores based on the given range and complexity, and finally calculating the mean score. The solution was implemented efficiently to handle the constraints, particularly the potential large input sizes.

    The final code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic for updating scores was straightforward. The key takeaway was the importance of managing index conversions (from 1-based to 0-based) when processing the roll number ranges. The solution passed the provided test case, confirming its correctness. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def calculate_mean_scores(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, M = map(int, input().split())
            scores = [10] * N
            for _ in range(M):
                i, j, k = map(int, input().split())
                for student in range(i - 1, j):  # Convert to 0-based index
                    scores[student] *= k
            mean_score = sum(scores) // N
            print(mean_score)

    T = int(input())
    calculate_mean_scores(T)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful index management and efficient score updates in competitive programming scenarios.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 615 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem involves calculating the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries. Each query specifies a range of indices, and we need to return the sum of the values in that range for each query. We have multiple test cases to handle.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To efficiently answer the sum queries, we can use a prefix sum array. The prefix sum array allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time after an initial linear time preprocessing step. The steps are as follows:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of bills and the number of queries.
   - Construct a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` contains the sum of the bills from the start up to index `i`.
   - For each query, use the prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum between the specified indices.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function solve():
       read T  // number of test cases
       for each test case from 1 to T:
           read N, Q  // number of bills and number of queries
           read array a of size N
           initialize prefix_sum array of size N+1
           prefix_sum[0] = 0
           for i from 1 to N:
               prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + a[i-1]
           for each query from 1 to Q:
               read X, Y  // indices for the query
               sum = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X-1]
               print sum

INFO - [Task id] 615 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem involves calculating the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries. Each query specifies a range of indices, and we need to return the sum of the values in that range for each query. We have multiple test cases to handle.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To efficiently answer the sum queries, we can use a prefix sum array. The prefix sum array allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in constant time after an initial linear time preprocessing step. The steps are as follows:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of bills and the number of queries.
   - Construct a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` contains the sum of the bills from the start up to index `i`.
   - For each query, use the prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum between the specified indices.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function solve():
       read T  // number of test cases
       for each test case from 1 to T:
           read N, Q  // number of bills and number of queries
           read array a of size N
           initialize prefix_sum array of size N+1
           prefix_sum[0] = 0
           for i from 1 to N:
               prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + a[i-1]
           for each query from 1 to Q:
               read X, Y  // indices for the query
               sum = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X-1]
               print sum
   ```

INFO - [Task id] 615 [generation text] In this task, I was required to implement a solution for calculating the sum of values in a list of bills based on multiple queries, using a prefix sum approach for efficiency. The core concept involved preprocessing the list of bills to create a prefix sum array, which allows for quick sum calculations over specified ranges.

The solution involved reading multiple test cases, constructing the prefix sum array in linear time, and then answering each query in constant time. This approach is efficient given the constraints, where both the number of bills and queries can be as high as 100,000.

The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was straightforward, leveraging the prefix sum technique to optimize the sum calculations. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all provided test cases, demonstrating its correctness and efficiency. 

Key code snippet for creating the prefix sum:
```python
prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + a[i - 1]
```
This line effectively builds the prefix sum array, allowing for quick access to the sum of any subarray. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of efficient algorithms in handling large datasets.

INFO - [Task id] 615 [generation text] The official solution provided is a straightforward implementation of the problem, but it lacks the efficiency that can be achieved with a prefix sum approach. The key insights from the official solution are as follows:

1. **Input Handling**: The solution reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the number of bills and queries. It uses lists to store the bills and queries.

2. **Direct Summation**: For each query, it directly sums the values between the specified indices using a loop. This results in a time complexity of O(Q * N) in the worst case, which can be inefficient for large inputs.

3. **Modulo Operation**: The solution includes a modulo operation to ensure that the sum does not exceed a certain limit, which is a good practice when dealing with large numbers.

In contrast, my approach utilized a prefix sum array, which allows for O(1) query time after an O(N) preprocessing step. This significantly improves efficiency, especially when the number of queries (Q) is large. The prefix sum method calculates the cumulative sum of the bills, enabling quick retrieval of sums over any range.

Overall, while the official solution works correctly, it is not optimal for larger datasets. The prefix sum approach is a more effective strategy for handling multiple range sum queries efficiently. This experience reinforces the importance of considering time complexity when designing solutions for problems involving large datasets.
