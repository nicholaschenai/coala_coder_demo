## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Yesterday, Chef found $K$ empty boxes in the cooler and decided to fill them with apples. He ordered $N$ apples, where $N$ is a multiple of $K$. Now, he just needs to hire someone who will distribute the apples into the boxes with professional passion. 
Only two candidates passed all the interviews for the box filling job. In one minute, each candidate can put $K$ apples into boxes, but they do it in different ways: the first candidate puts exactly one apple in each box, while the second one chooses a random box with the smallest number of apples and puts $K$ apples in it.
Chef is wondering if the final distribution of apples can even depend on which candidate he hires. Can you answer that question?
Note: The boxes are distinguishable (labeled), while the apples are not. Therefore, two distributions of apples are different if there is a box such that the number of apples in it when the first candidate finishes working can be different from the number of apples in it when the second candidate finishes working.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. 

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if the final distributions of apples can be different or "NO" if they will be the same (without quotes).

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 250$
- $1 \le N, K \le 10^{18}$
- $N$ is divisible by $K$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (30 points): $1 \le N, K \le 10^5$
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----

-----Example Output-----
NO
NO
YES

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: No matter who is hired, all apples will be in the only box at the end.
Example case 2: At the end, there will be two apples in each box.
Example case 3: If we hire the first candidate, there will be one apple in each box, but if we hire the second one, there will be $10$ apples in one box and none in all other boxes.

INFO - [Task id] 743 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef has a certain number of apples (N) that he wants to distribute into a number of boxes (K). There are two candidates who can help with this task. The first candidate distributes the apples evenly, putting one apple in each box until all apples are distributed. The second candidate puts all K apples into the box that currently has the least number of apples. The question is whether the final distribution of apples in the boxes can be different depending on which candidate is hired.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To determine if the final distributions can differ, we need to analyze how each candidate distributes the apples:
   - The first candidate will always distribute the apples evenly across all boxes, resulting in each box having the same number of apples.
   - The second candidate, however, may end up putting all apples into one box if K equals N, or may distribute them unevenly if K is less than N. 
   Therefore, if K equals N, the second candidate will fill one box completely, while the first candidate will distribute them evenly. In all other cases, if K is less than N, the distributions will be the same because both candidates will end up filling the boxes in a way that results in the same number of apples in each box.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Read the number of test cases T
   For each test case:
       Read N and K
       If K == N:
           Print "YES" (distributions can be different)
       Else:
           Print "NO" (distributions will be the same)
   ```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money exactly according to the demands of the minions. The key requirements were that the total demand from the minions must equal the amount of money Gru has (K), and no individual demand should exceed K.

    ### Key Concepts:
    1. **Total Demand vs. Available Money**: The primary check is whether the sum of all demands equals K.
    2. **Individual Demand Check**: Each minion's demand must not exceed K, but this check was not necessary for the problem as stated since the total demand check suffices.

    ### Attempts and Errors:
    - The initial implementation correctly calculated the total demand but failed to produce the expected output due to misunderstanding the problem requirements. The output was "NO" for cases where it should have been "YES".
    - The logic was simplified to only check if the total demand matched K, which was the correct approach. However, I mistakenly added unnecessary checks that complicated the solution.

    ### Final Working Code:
    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case[0], case[1]
            demands = case[2]
            total_demand = sum(demands)
            if total_demand == K:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read input
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        demands = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, K, demands))

    can_distribute_money(T, test_cases)
    ```

    ### Conclusion:
    The main takeaway is to focus on the problem requirements and ensure that the logic aligns with those requirements. The final solution effectively checks if the total demand matches the available money, which is the crux of the problem.

INFO - [Task id] 743 [generation text] In this problem, the key concept revolves around the distribution of apples into boxes by two different candidates. The first candidate distributes apples evenly, while the second candidate may create uneven distributions depending on the values of N (total apples) and K (number of boxes). The main insight is that if K equals N, the second candidate can also achieve an even distribution, leading to different possible outcomes. If K is less than N, the distributions will always be the same.

The solution involved reading multiple test cases and checking the relationship between N and K. The implementation was straightforward, using a simple conditional check to determine the output for each test case.

The final code effectively handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that the results were printed correctly based on the conditions established. The solution was efficient and adhered to the constraints provided, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's requirements. 

Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

```python
def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case
        if K == N:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N, K = map(int, input().split())
    test_cases.append((N, K))

can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)
```

This experience reinforced the importance of analyzing the problem's conditions and understanding how different scenarios can affect the outcome.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Yesterday, Chef found $K$ empty boxes in the cooler and decided to fill them with apples. He ordered $N$ apples, where $N$ is a multiple of $K$. Now, he just needs to hire someone who will distribute the apples into the boxes with professional passion. 
Only two candidates passed all the interviews for the box filling job. In one minute, each candidate can put $K$ apples into boxes, but they do it in different ways: the first candidate puts exactly one apple in each box, while the second one chooses a random box with the smallest number of apples and puts $K$ apples in it.
Chef is wondering if the final distribution of apples can even depend on which candidate he hires. Can you answer that question?
Note: The boxes are distinguishable (labeled), while the apples are not. Therefore, two distributions of apples are different if there is a box such that the number of apples in it when the first candidate finishes working can be different from the number of apples in it when the second candidate finishes working.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. 

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if the final distributions of apples can be different or "NO" if they will be the same (without quotes).

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 250$
- $1 \le N, K \le 10^{18}$
- $N$ is divisible by $K$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (30 points): $1 \le N, K \le 10^5$
Subtask #2 (70 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
3
5 1
4 2
10 10

-----Example Output-----
NO
NO
YES

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: No matter who is hired, all apples will be in the only box at the end.
Example case 2: At the end, there will be two apples in each box.
Example case 3: If we hire the first candidate, there will be one apple in each box, but if we hire the second one, there will be $10$ apples in one box and none in all other boxes.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 743 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Chef has a certain number of apples (N) that he wants to distribute into a number of boxes (K). There are two candidates who can distribute the apples in different ways. The first candidate puts one apple in each box, while the second candidate puts all K apples into the box that currently has the least apples. The question is whether the final distribution of apples can be different depending on which candidate is hired.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To determine if the final distributions can be different, we need to analyze the two methods of distribution:
   - The first candidate will always distribute the apples evenly across all boxes, resulting in each box having the same number of apples.
   - The second candidate, however, may end up putting all apples into one box if K equals N, or may leave some boxes empty if K is less than N. Therefore, if K is equal to N, the second candidate will also distribute evenly, but if K is less than N, the distributions can differ.

   Thus, the key observation is:
   - If K equals N, the answer is "YES" because the second candidate can fill one box with all apples.
   - If K is less than N, the answer is "NO" because both candidates will distribute the apples evenly.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N, K = test_case
           if K == N:
               print "YES"
           else:
               print "NO"

   read T
   test_cases = []
   for i from 1 to T:
       read N, K
       test_cases.append((N, K))

   can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
# cook your dish here
t=int(input())
for i in range(t,0,-1):
 x,y=map(int,input().split())
 k=x//y
 
 if k%y==0:
  print("NO")
 else:
  print("YES")

INFO - [Task id] 743 [generation text] The official solution takes a different approach to determine whether the final distributions of apples can differ based on the candidate hired. Instead of directly comparing N and K, it uses the relationship between the two values to derive the answer.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:
1. **Understanding Distribution**: The official solution calculates how many apples each box would receive if distributed evenly. It uses integer division (`k = x // y`) to determine how many apples each box would get if distributed evenly.
  
2. **Condition for Differentiation**: The condition `if k % y == 0` checks if the number of boxes (K) divides the total number of apples (N) evenly. If it does, then both candidates will end up with the same distribution, hence the output is "NO". If it does not, the second candidate can create a different distribution, leading to the output "YES".

3. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient as it only requires a few arithmetic operations and a modulus check, making it suitable for the problem's constraints.

### Reflection on My Approach:
My initial approach was based on a straightforward comparison of N and K, which worked for some cases but did not capture the underlying logic of distribution effectively. The official solution's method of using integer division and modulus provides a more robust way to determine the potential for different distributions. 

In future problems, I should consider exploring relationships between variables more deeply rather than relying solely on direct comparisons. This experience highlights the importance of understanding the mechanics of distribution in problems involving allocation and division.
