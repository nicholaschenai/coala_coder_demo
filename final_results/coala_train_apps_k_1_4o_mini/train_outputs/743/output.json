    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   Chef has a certain number of apples (N) that he wants to distribute into a number of boxes (K). There are two candidates who can distribute the apples in different ways. The first candidate puts one apple in each box, while the second candidate puts all K apples into the box that currently has the least apples. The question is whether the final distribution of apples can be different depending on which candidate is hired.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To determine if the final distributions can be different, we need to analyze the two methods of distribution:\n   - The first candidate will always distribute the apples evenly across all boxes, resulting in each box having the same number of apples.\n   - The second candidate, however, may end up putting all apples into one box if K equals N, or may leave some boxes empty if K is less than N. Therefore, if K is equal to N, the second candidate will also distribute evenly, but if K is less than N, the distributions can differ.\n\n   Thus, the key observation is:\n   - If K equals N, the answer is \"YES\" because the second candidate can fill one box with all apples.\n   - If K is less than N, the answer is \"NO\" because both candidates will distribute the apples evenly.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           N, K = test_case\n           if K == N:\n               print \"YES\"\n           else:\n               print \"NO\"\n\n   read T\n   test_cases = []\n   for i from 1 to T:\n       read N, K\n       test_cases.append((N, K))\n\n   can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):\n    # Iterate through each test case\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N, K = case\n        # Check if K is equal to N\n        if K == N:\n            print(\"YES\")  # If they are equal, distributions can differ\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")   # If not, distributions will be the same\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\n# Read each test case\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    test_cases.append((N, K))\n\n# Call the function to determine the distribution possibility\ncan_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)\n```",
