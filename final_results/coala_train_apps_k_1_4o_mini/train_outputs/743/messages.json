He ordered $N$ apples, where $N$ is a multiple of $K$. Now, he just needs to hire someone who will distribute the apples into the boxes with professional passion. \nOnly two candidates passed all the interviews for the box filling job. In one minute, each candidate can put $K$ apples into boxes, but they do it in different ways: the first candidate puts exactly one apple in each box, while the second one chooses a random box with the smallest number of apples and puts $K$ apples in it.\nChef is wondering if the final distribution of apples can even depend on which candidate he hires. Can you answer that question?\nNote: The boxes are distinguishable (labeled), while the apples are not. Therefore, two distributions of apples are different if there is a box such that the number of apples in it when the first candidate finishes working can be different from the number of apples in it when the second candidate finishes working.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. \n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string \"YES\" if the final distributions of apples can be different or \"NO\" if they will be the same (without quotes).\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 250$\n- $1 \\le N, K \\le 10^{18}$\n- $N$ is divisible by $K$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (30 points): $1 \\le N, K \\le 10^5$\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n-----Example Input-----\n3\n5 1\n4 2\n10 10\n\n-----Example Output-----\nNO\nNO\nYES\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1: No matter who is hired, all apples will be in the only box at the end.\nExample case 2: At the end, there will be two apples in each box.\nExample case 3: If we hire the first candidate, there will be one apple in each box, but if we hire the second one, there will be $10$ apples in one box and none in all other boxes.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

There are two candidates who can help with this task. The first candidate distributes the apples evenly, putting one apple in each box until all apples are distributed. The second candidate puts all K apples into the box that currently has the least number of apples. The question is whether the final distribution of apples in the boxes can be different depending on which candidate is hired.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To determine if the final distributions can differ, we need to analyze how each candidate distributes the apples:\n   - The first candidate will always distribute the apples evenly across all boxes, resulting in each box having the same number of apples.\n   - The second candidate, however, may end up putting all apples into one box if K equals N, or may distribute them unevenly if K is less than N. \n   Therefore, if K equals N, the second candidate will fill one box completely, while the first candidate will distribute them evenly. In all other cases, if K is less than N, the distributions will be the same because both candidates will end up filling the boxes in a way that results in the same number of apples in each box.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Read the number of test cases T\n   For each test case:\n       Read N and K\n       If K == N:\n           Print \"YES\" (distributions can be different)\n       Else:\n           Print \"NO\" (distributions will be the same)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\n\n# Iterate through each test case\nfor _ in range(T):\n    # Read N and K\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    # Check if K is equal to N\n    if K == N:\n        # If K equals N, the distributions can be different\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        # Otherwise, the distributions will be the same\n        print(\"NO\")\n```"

The key requirements were that the total demand from the minions must equal the amount of money Gru has (K), and no individual demand should exceed K.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    1. **Total Demand vs. Available Money**: The primary check is whether the sum of all demands equals K.\n    2. **Individual Demand Check**: Each minion's demand must not exceed K, but this check was not necessary for the problem as stated since the total demand check suffices.\n\n    ### Attempts and Errors:\n    - The initial implementation correctly calculated the total demand but failed to produce the expected output due to misunderstanding the problem requirements. The output was \"NO\" for cases where it should have been \"YES\".\n    - The logic was simplified to only check if the total demand matched K, which was the correct approach. However, I mistakenly added unnecessary checks that complicated the solution.\n\n    ### Final Working Code:\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case[0], case[1]\n            demands = case[2]\n            total_demand = sum(demands)\n            if total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    # Read input\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        demands = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, demands))\n\n    can_distribute_money(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    ### Conclusion:\n    The main takeaway is to focus on the problem requirements and ensure that the logic aligns with those requirements. The final solution effectively checks if the total demand matches the available money, which is the crux of the problem.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Instead of directly comparing N and K, it uses the relationship between the two values to derive the answer.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n1. **Understanding Distribution**: The official solution calculates how many apples each box would receive if distributed evenly. It uses integer division (`k = x // y`) to determine how many apples each box would get if distributed evenly.\n  \n2. **Condition for Differentiation**: The condition `if k % y == 0` checks if the number of boxes (K) divides the total number of apples (N) evenly. If it does, then both candidates will end up with the same distribution, hence the output is \"NO\". If it does not, the second candidate can create a different distribution, leading to the output \"YES\".\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient as it only requires a few arithmetic operations and a modulus check, making it suitable for the problem's constraints.\n\n### Reflection on My Approach:\nMy initial approach was based on a straightforward comparison of N and K, which worked for some cases but did not capture the underlying logic of distribution effectively. The official solution's method of using integer division and modulus provides a more robust way to determine the potential for different distributions. \n\nIn future problems, I should consider exploring relationships between variables more deeply rather than relying solely on direct comparisons.

It can apply to resource allocation problems, logistics, and operations research where the method of distribution can lead to different results. Understanding the implications of distribution methods can help in decision-making processes in various fields such as supply chain management, game theory, and algorithm design."
