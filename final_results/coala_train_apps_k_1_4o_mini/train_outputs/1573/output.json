    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The problem involves a tennis tournament where each player competes against every other player exactly once, and there are no ties. The goal is to determine if it's possible for all players to win the same number of matches. If it is possible, we need to provide a specific arrangement of wins and losses for each player.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we need to recognize that if there are an even number of players, it is impossible for each player to win the same number of matches. This is because each player would have to win half of their matches, which is not an integer. However, if there is an odd number of players, we can create a circular win pattern where each player beats the next player in line, ensuring that everyone wins the same number of matches. \n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Read the number of test cases T\n   For each test case:\n       Read the number of players N\n       If N is even:\n           Print \"NO\"\n       Else:\n           Print \"YES\"\n           Initialize a 2D list (N x N) with all zeros\n           For i from 0 to N-1:\n               For j from 0 to N-1:\n                   If i wins against j (i beats j):\n                       Set the corresponding position in the list to 1\n           Print the 2D list as strings\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\n\n# Process each test case\nfor _ in range(T):\n    # Read the number of players\n    N = int(input())\n    \n    # Check if N is even\n    if N % 2 == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")  # It's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")  # It's possible to create a valid scenario\n        # Initialize a 2D list to represent the match results\n        results = [[0] * N for _ in range(N)]\n        \n        # Fill the results based on a circular win pattern\n        for i in range(N):\n            for j in range(N):\n                if i != j:\n                    # Player i beats player (i + 1) % N\n                    if (j == (i + 1) % N):\n                        results[i][j] = 1\n        \n        # Print the results\n        for row in results:\n            print(''.join(map(str, row)))  # Convert each row to a string of 0s and 1s\n```",
