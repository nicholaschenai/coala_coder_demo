    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The problem involves determining how many walls Chef needs to break through to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). Each wall is represented by a line segment that connects two points on the axes. For each starting position of Chef, we need to check if he is on a wall, and if not, count how many walls he would need to break to reach the origin.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - For each test case, read the number of walls and their respective positions.\n   - For each query (Chef's starting position), check if the position lies on any wall. If it does, return -1.\n   - If not on a wall, determine how many walls Chef would need to break through to reach the origin. This can be done by checking how many wall lines are above the line formed by Chef's starting position.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function process_test_cases():\n       read T\n       for each test case:\n           read N\n           read wall positions a_i\n           read Q\n           for each query:\n               read x_j, y_j\n               if (x_j + y_j) in wall positions:\n                   print -1\n               else:\n                   count = 0\n                   for each wall position a_i:\n                       if a_i > x_j + y_j:\n                           count += 1\n                   print count\n\n   main():\n       process_test_cases()\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef count_walls(N, walls, Q, queries):\n    results = []\n    for x_j, y_j in queries:\n        # Check if the point lies on any wall\n        if x_j + y_j in walls:\n            results.append(-1)\n        else:\n            # Count how many walls Chef needs to break\n            count = 0\n            for a_i in walls:\n                if a_i > x_j + y_j:\n                    count += 1\n            results.append(count)\n    return results\n\ndef process_test_cases():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        walls = list(map(int, data[index].split()))\n        index += 1\n        Q = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        \n        queries = []\n        for __ in range(Q):\n            x_j, y_j = map(int, data[index].split())\n            queries.append((x_j, y_j))\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Get results for this test case\n        results.extend(count_walls(N, walls, Q, queries))\n    \n    # Print all results\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Call the function to process input and output results\nprocess_test_cases()\n```",
