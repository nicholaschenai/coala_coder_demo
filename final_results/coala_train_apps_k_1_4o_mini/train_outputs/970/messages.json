But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.\nFormally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.\n\n-----Input-----\n- First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.\n- The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.\n- The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.\n- The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.\n- The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 2 * 10^2$\n- $1 \\leq N, Q \\leq 2 * 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$\n- $0 \\leq x_j, y_j \\leq 10^9$\n- $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$\n- Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n1\n2\n1 3\n5\n0 0\n2 0\n0 4\n1 1\n1 2\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n0\n1\n2\n1\n-1\n\n-----Explanation-----\nThe sample input can be represented by the graph given below:\n\nIf Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.\n\nIf Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.\n\nIf Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.\n\nIf Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.\n\nAs $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

There are several walls represented by line segments that connect points on the x-axis and y-axis. Each wall is defined by a unique integer `a_i`, which indicates the endpoints of the wall at (a_i, 0) and (0, a_i). For each of Chef's starting positions, we need to determine how many walls he must break through to reach Dr. Doof. If Chef starts on a wall, we should return -1.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution:**\n   - For each test case, read the number of walls and their respective positions.\n   - For each query (Chef's starting position), check if the position lies on any wall. If it does, return -1.\n   - If not, determine how many walls Chef needs to break through. A wall is considered broken if Chef's starting position is above and to the right of the wall's endpoints.\n   - Since the walls are sorted, we can efficiently count how many walls Chef needs to break using a simple comparison.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function process_test_case(N, walls, Q, queries):\n       for each query (x_j, y_j):\n           if (x_j + y_j) in walls:\n               print -1\n           else:\n               count = 0\n               for each wall in walls:\n                   if (x_j + y_j) > wall:\n                       count += 1\n               print count\n\n   main function:\n       read T\n       for each test case:\n           read N\n           read walls\n           read Q\n           read queries\n           process_test_case(N, walls, Q, queries)\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 solution:**\n```python\ndef process_test_case(N, walls, Q, queries):\n    for x_j, y_j in queries:\n        # Check if the point lies on any wall\n        if x_j + y_j in walls:\n            print(-1)\n        else:\n            count = 0\n            # Count how many walls Chef needs to break\n            for wall in walls:\n                if x_j + y_j > wall:\n                    count += 1\n            print(count)\n\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())\n    walls = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    Q = int(input())\n    queries = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(Q)]\n    process_test_case(N, walls, Q, queries)\n```"

The key insight was recognizing that the maximum reduction possible is the sum of the first N natural numbers, which can be calculated using the formula \\(N \\times (N + 1) / 2\\).\n\n    Initially, the solution incorrectly handled the conditions for determining if the sequence could be made \"good.\" The logic needed to explicitly check if the total sum was zero, if it was positive and could be reduced to zero, or if it was negative, which would immediately result in \"NO.\" \n\n    The final working solution iterates through each test case, calculates the total sum and maximum reduction, and checks the conditions correctly. The code snippet that encapsulates the solution is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            A = case[1]\n            total_sum = sum(A)\n            max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2\n        \n            if total_sum == 0:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            elif total_sum > 0 and total_sum <= max_reduction:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all possible conditions and edge cases when solving problems involving sums and modifications of sequences.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This is a significant improvement over my initial approach, which involved a linear search through the walls for each query. \n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Binary Search for Efficiency**: The `posSearch` function uses binary search to find the position where the sum of Chef's coordinates (`x + y`) would fit among the wall positions. This reduces the time complexity from O(N) for each query to O(log N), making it much more efficient, especially given the constraints.\n\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function checks if the sum is less than the smallest wall or greater than the largest wall, returning appropriate indices directly. This ensures that edge cases are handled without unnecessary comparisons.\n\n3. **Directly Checking for Wall Presence**: The solution checks if the sum equals any wall position and returns -1 immediately if it does, which is a clean way to handle the condition where Chef starts on a wall.\n\n4. **Overall Structure**: The solution is structured to read input and process each test case in a loop, maintaining clarity and separation of concerns.\n\nIn contrast, my approach involved iterating through all walls for each query, which could lead to inefficiencies, especially with the upper limits of the constraints. The official solution's use of binary search not only optimizes performance but also simplifies the logic for determining the number of walls Chef needs to break. \n\nIn future problems, I should consider using binary search or other efficient algorithms when dealing with sorted data, as it can significantly reduce the time complexity and improve performance."
