## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

-----Input-----
- First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
- The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
- The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
- The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
- The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

-----Output-----
For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
- $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
- $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
- $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
- $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
- Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

-----Sample Input-----
1
2
1 3
5
0 0
2 0
0 4
1 1
1 2

-----Sample Output-----
0
1
2
1
-1

-----Explanation-----
The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 970 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef needs to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). There are several walls represented by line segments that connect points on the x-axis and y-axis. Each wall is defined by a unique integer `a_i`, which indicates the endpoints of the wall at (a_i, 0) and (0, a_i). For each of Chef's starting positions, we need to determine how many walls he must break through to reach Dr. Doof. If Chef starts on a wall, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution:**
   - For each test case, read the number of walls and their respective positions.
   - For each query (Chef's starting position), check if the position lies on any wall. If it does, return -1.
   - If not, determine how many walls Chef needs to break through. A wall is considered broken if Chef's starting position is above and to the right of the wall's endpoints.
   - Since the walls are sorted, we can efficiently count how many walls Chef needs to break using a simple comparison.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function process_test_case(N, walls, Q, queries):
       for each query (x_j, y_j):
           if (x_j + y_j) in walls:
               print -1
           else:
               count = 0
               for each wall in walls:
                   if (x_j + y_j) > wall:
                       count += 1
               print count

   main function:
       read T
       for each test case:
           read N
           read walls
           read Q
           read queries
           process_test_case(N, walls, Q, queries)
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 solution:**
```python
def process_test_case(N, walls, Q, queries):
    for x_j, y_j in queries:
        # Check if the point lies on any wall
        if x_j + y_j in walls:
            print(-1)
        else:
            count = 0
            # Count how many walls Chef needs to break
            for wall in walls:
                if x_j + y_j > wall:
                    count += 1
            print(count)

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing elements based on their indices. The key insight was recognizing that the maximum reduction possible is the sum of the first N natural numbers, which can be calculated using the formula \(N \times (N + 1) / 2\).

    Initially, the solution incorrectly handled the conditions for determining if the sequence could be made "good." The logic needed to explicitly check if the total sum was zero, if it was positive and could be reduced to zero, or if it was negative, which would immediately result in "NO." 

    The final working solution iterates through each test case, calculates the total sum and maximum reduction, and checks the conditions correctly. The code snippet that encapsulates the solution is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            A = case[1]
            total_sum = sum(A)
            max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2
        
            if total_sum == 0:
                print("YES")
            elif total_sum > 0 and total_sum <= max_reduction:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering all possible conditions and edge cases when solving problems involving sums and modifications of sequences.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 970 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem involves determining how many walls Chef needs to break through to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). Each wall is represented by a line segment that connects two points on the axes. For each starting position of Chef, we need to check if he is on a wall, and if not, count how many walls he would need to break to reach the origin.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each test case, read the number of walls and their respective positions.
   - For each query (Chef's starting position), check if the position lies on any wall. If it does, return -1.
   - If not on a wall, determine how many walls Chef would need to break through to reach the origin. This can be done by checking how many wall lines are above the line formed by Chef's starting position.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

-----Input-----
- First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
- The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
- The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
- The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
- The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

-----Output-----
For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
- $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
- $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
- $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
- $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
- Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

-----Sample Input-----
1
2
1 3
5
0 0
2 0
0 4
1 1
1 2

-----Sample Output-----
0
1
2
1
-1

-----Explanation-----
The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.

INFO - [Task id] 970 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem involves determining how many walls Chef needs to break through to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). Each wall is represented by a line segment that connects two points on the axes. For each starting position of Chef, we need to check if he is on a wall, and if not, count how many walls he would need to break to reach the origin.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each test case, read the number of walls and their respective positions.
   - For each query (Chef's starting position), check if the position lies on any wall. If it does, return -1.
   - If not on a wall, determine how many walls Chef would need to break through to reach the origin. This can be done by checking how many wall lines are above the line formed by Chef's starting position.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 970 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine how many walls Chef needs to break through to reach Dr. Doof at the origin (0, 0) based on given wall positions and Chef's starting coordinates. The walls are represented by line segments connecting points on the axes, and the challenge involved checking if Chef's starting position lies on any wall and counting how many walls are above the line formed by his position.

The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing wall positions, and handling multiple queries efficiently. The key steps included checking if the starting position was on a wall and counting the number of walls that Chef would need to break through. The approach used a simple linear search to count walls, which was straightforward given the constraints.

The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that results were printed correctly for each query. The main function processed input in bulk for efficiency, which is crucial given the potential size of the input data. 

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of efficiently managing input and output in competitive programming, especially when dealing with large datasets. The solution was effective, and no unexpected errors were encountered during implementation.

INFO - [Task id] 970 [generation text] The official solution employs a binary search approach to efficiently determine how many walls Chef needs to break through to reach Dr. Doof. This is a significant improvement over my initial approach, which involved a linear search through the walls for each query. 

Key insights from the official solution:

1. **Binary Search for Efficiency**: The `posSearch` function uses binary search to find the position where the sum of Chef's coordinates (`x + y`) would fit among the wall positions. This reduces the time complexity from O(N) for each query to O(log N), making it much more efficient, especially given the constraints.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function checks if the sum is less than the smallest wall or greater than the largest wall, returning appropriate indices directly. This ensures that edge cases are handled without unnecessary comparisons.

3. **Directly Checking for Wall Presence**: The solution checks if the sum equals any wall position and returns -1 immediately if it does, which is a clean way to handle the condition where Chef starts on a wall.

4. **Overall Structure**: The solution is structured to read input and process each test case in a loop, maintaining clarity and separation of concerns.

In contrast, my approach involved iterating through all walls for each query, which could lead to inefficiencies, especially with the upper limits of the constraints. The official solution's use of binary search not only optimizes performance but also simplifies the logic for determining the number of walls Chef needs to break. 

In future problems, I should consider using binary search or other efficient algorithms when dealing with sorted data, as it can significantly reduce the time complexity and improve performance.

process_test_cases()


The main function is `process_test_cases`.
INFO - [Task id] 970 [generation text] This function processes multiple test cases by reading input data, which includes the number of walls and queries for each test case. It iterates through each test case, collecting the number of walls and their positions, as well as the queries that consist of coordinates. For each query, it checks if the point lies on any wall and counts how many walls need to be broken if it does not. The results for each query are collected and printed at the end. The function handles input and output in a structured manner, ensuring that all results are displayed sequentially. Overall, it efficiently manages the processing of multiple queries related to wall positions.

[Problem]
    You may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.
    Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.

    -----Input-----
    - First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.
    - The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.
    - The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.
    - The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.
    - The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.

    -----Output-----
    For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print $-1$.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 2 * 10^2$
    - $1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 * 10^5$
    - $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$
    - $0 \leq x_j, y_j \leq 10^9$
    - $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < .... < a_N$
    - Sum of $N$ and $Q$ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed $2 * 10^5$

    -----Sample Input-----
    1
    2
    1 3
    5
    0 0
    2 0
    0 4
    1 1
    1 2

    -----Sample Output-----
    0
    1
    2
    1
    -1

    -----Explanation-----
    The sample input can be represented by the graph given below:

    If Chef starts from $(0, 0)$, he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.

    If Chef starts from $(2, 0)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

    If Chef starts from $(0, 4)$, he has to destroy both the walls.

    If Chef starts from $(1, 1)$, he has to destroy the $1st$ wall.

    As $(1, 2)$ lies on the second wall, the answer is $-1$ for the last query.
