    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to find the smallest substring in a given string `S` that contains all the characters from another string `T`. If no such substring exists, we should return an empty string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach. We will maintain a window that expands to include characters from `T` and contracts to find the minimum length that still contains all characters from `T`. We will use two pointers to represent the current window and a dictionary to count the characters in `T` and the current window. As we expand the window by moving the right pointer, we will check if we have all characters from `T`. If we do, we will try to contract the window from the left to minimize its size while still containing all characters.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function minWindow(S, T):\n       if T is empty:\n           return \"\"\n       \n       create a dictionary to count characters in T\n       create a dictionary to count characters in the current window\n       initialize left and right pointers\n       initialize variables for the minimum length and result substring\n       \n       while right pointer is less than length of S:\n           add character at right pointer to the current window\n           check if current window contains all characters from T\n           \n           while current window contains all characters from T:\n               update minimum length and result substring if current window is smaller\n               remove character at left pointer from the current window\n               move left pointer to the right\n           \n           move right pointer to the right\n       \n       return result substring\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:\n        # Step 1: Handle edge case where T is empty\n        if not t:\n            return \"\"\n        \n        # Step 2: Create dictionaries to count characters in T and the current window\n        dict_t = {}\n        for char in t:\n            dict_t[char] = dict_t.get(char, 0) + 1\n        \n        # Step 3: Initialize pointers and variables for the sliding window\n        required = len(dict_t)\n        l, r = 0, 0\n        formed = 0\n        window_counts = {}\n        min_length = float(\"inf\")\n        min_window = (0, 0)  # (start, end) indices of the minimum window\n        \n        # Step 4: Start sliding the window\n        while r < len(s):\n            char = s[r]\n            window_counts[char] = window_counts.get(char, 0) + 1\n            \n            # Step 5: Check if the current character added is part of T and if we have enough of it\n            if char in dict_t and window_counts[char] == dict_t[char]:\n                formed += 1\n            \n            # Step 6: Try to contract the window until it ceases to be 'desirable'\n            while l <= r and formed == required:\n                char = s[l]\n                \n                # Update the minimum window if the current window is smaller\n                if r - l + 1 < min_length:\n                    min_length = r - l + 1\n                    min_window = (l, r)\n                \n                # Remove the leftmost character from the window\n                window_counts[char] -= 1\n                if char in dict_t and window_counts[char] < dict_t[char]:\n                    formed -= 1\n                \n                l += 1  # Move left pointer to the right\n            \n            # Step 7: Expand the window by moving the right pointer\n            r += 1\n        \n        # Step 8: Return the minimum window substring or empty string if not found\n        start, end = min_window\n        return s[start:end + 1] if min_length != float(\"inf\") else \"\"\n```",
