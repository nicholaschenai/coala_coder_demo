## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within D days.
The i-th package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i].Â  Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within D days.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed. 

Example 2:
Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], D = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
1st day: 3, 2
2nd day: 2, 4
3rd day: 1, 4

Example 3:
Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], D = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: 
1st day: 1
2nd day: 2
3rd day: 3
4th day: 1, 1

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= D <= weights.length <= 50000
1 <= weights[i] <= 500

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to determine the minimum weight capacity of a ship that can transport a series of packages within a specified number of days. The packages must be loaded in the order they are given, and the total weight loaded each day cannot exceed the ship's capacity.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach. The idea is to find the minimum capacity that allows us to ship all packages within the given number of days. We will set the lower bound of our search to the maximum weight of a single package (since the ship must be able to carry at least the heaviest package) and the upper bound to the total weight of all packages (which would be the capacity if we shipped everything in one day). We will then check if a given capacity can ship all packages within the allowed days by simulating the loading process.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function shipWithinDays(weights, D):
       set left to max(weights)  // minimum possible capacity
       set right to sum(weights)  // maximum possible capacity
       
       while left < right:
           set mid to (left + right) // 2
           if canShip(weights, mid, D):
               set right to mid  // try for a smaller capacity
           else:
               set left to mid + 1  // increase capacity
       
       return left  // this is the minimum capacity that works

   function canShip(weights, capacity, D):
       set days to 1
       set currentWeight to 0
       
       for weight in weights:
           if currentWeight + weight > capacity:
               increment days
               set currentWeight to weight  // start new day with this package
           else:
               add weight to currentWeight
       
       return days <= D  // check if we can ship within D days
   ```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the problems created by several setters. The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems available and calculating how many contests could be formed based on the required number of problems per contest, while also considering the limited number of days available.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, summing the problems from each setter, and then calculating the number of contests possible by dividing the total problems by the number of problems needed for one contest. The final result for each test case was the minimum of the contests possible and the days available.

    The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the constraints provided. The code was structured to read input, process each test case, and output the results efficiently. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all test cases, demonstrating that the approach was effective. 

    Key code snippet:
    ```python
    total_problems = sum(A)
    contests_possible = total_problems // K
    max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that all constraints are considered in the final calculations.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within D days.
The i-th package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i].Â  Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within D days.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed. 

Example 2:
Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], D = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
1st day: 3, 2
2nd day: 2, 4
3rd day: 1, 4

Example 3:
Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], D = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: 
1st day: 1
2nd day: 2
3rd day: 3
4th day: 1, 1

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= D <= weights.length <= 50000
1 <= weights[i] <= 500

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with:

INFO - [Task id] 360 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to determine the minimum weight capacity of a ship that can transport a series of packages within a specified number of days. Each package has a specific weight, and the ship can only carry a certain maximum weight each day. The packages must be loaded in the order they are given.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach. The idea is to find the minimum weight capacity that allows us to ship all packages within the given number of days. We will set the lower bound of our search to the maximum weight of a single package (since the ship must be able to carry at least the heaviest package) and the upper bound to the total weight of all packages (which would be the maximum capacity if we shipped everything in one day). We will then check for each mid-point capacity if it is possible to ship all packages within the allowed days. If it is possible, we will try a smaller capacity; if not, we will increase the capacity.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function shipWithinDays(weights, D):
       set left to max(weights)  // minimum possible capacity
       set right to sum(weights)  // maximum possible capacity
       
       while left < right:
           set mid to (left + right) // 2
           if canShip(weights, mid, D):
               right = mid  // try for a smaller capacity
           else:
               left = mid + 1  // increase capacity
       
       return left  // this is the minimum capacity that works

   function canShip(weights, capacity, D):
       set days to 1
       set currentWeight to 0
       
       for weight in weights:
           if currentWeight + weight > capacity:
               days += 1
               currentWeight = weight  // start a new day

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] In this task, I was required to determine the minimum weight capacity of a ship that can transport packages within a specified number of days. The approach I used was a binary search strategy, which is effective for problems involving finding a minimum or maximum value under certain constraints.

The core concept involved setting the lower bound of the search to the maximum weight of a single package and the upper bound to the total weight of all packages. The binary search iteratively checked if a mid-point capacity could ship all packages within the allowed days using a helper function. This function tracked the current weight loaded and the number of days used, incrementing the day count whenever the current weight exceeded the capacity.

The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test cases. The key takeaway from this experience is the effectiveness of binary search in optimization problems, especially when dealing with constraints like weight limits and time. The solution was straightforward and did not encounter unexpected errors, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem requirements and constraints. 

Hereâs the final code snippet for future reference:

```python

    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: list[int], D: int) -> int:

        return left

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] The official solution effectively utilizes a binary search approach to determine the minimum ship capacity required to transport packages within a specified number of days. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Initialization of Bounds**: The left bound is set to the maximum weight of a single package, ensuring that the ship can at least carry the heaviest package. The right bound is calculated as the total weight divided by the number of days, which provides an upper limit on the capacity needed if the packages were evenly distributed.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The algorithm iteratively narrows down the possible ship capacities. For each mid-point capacity, it checks if all packages can be shipped within the allowed days. If the number of days required exceeds D, it means the capacity is too low, and the search continues in the upper half. Otherwise, it adjusts the search to the lower half.

3. **Counting Days**: The inner loop counts how many days are needed for the current mid capacity. It accumulates weights until adding another package would exceed the capacity, at which point it increments the day count and resets the current weight.

4. **Efficiency**: The solution is efficient, operating in O(N log W) time complexity, where N is the number of packages and W is the range of possible weights. This is due to the binary search combined with a linear scan of the weights.

In contrast, my initial approach was similar but had a slight difference in how the upper bound was defined. I used the total weight as the upper limit, which could lead to unnecessary iterations. The official solution's method of calculating the right bound as `left * len(weights) // D` is more optimal, as it directly relates to the average weight per day, thus refining the search space more effectively.

Overall, the official solution is a good example of combining binary search with a greedy approach to solve a constrained optimization problem efficiently.

    A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
    1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    2nd day: 6, 7
    3rd day: 8
    4th day: 9
    5th day: 10

    Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed. 

    Example 2:
    Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], D = 3
    Output: 6
    Explanation: 
    A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
    1st day: 3, 2
    2nd day: 2, 4
    3rd day: 1, 4

    Example 3:
    Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], D = 4
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 
    1st day: 1
    2nd day: 2
    3rd day: 3
    4th day: 1, 1

    class Solution:
        def shipWithinDays(self, weights: list[int], D: int) -> int:
            # Set the lower bound to the maximum weight of a single package
            left = max(weights)
            # Set the upper bound to the total weight of all packages
            right = sum(weights)
        
            # Perform binary search to find the minimum capacity
            while left < right:
                mid = (left + right) // 2  # Check the middle capacity
                if self.canShip(weights, mid, D):
                    right = mid  # If we can ship, try for a smaller capacity
                else:
                    left = mid + 1  # If not, increase the capacity
        
            return left  # The minimum capacity that works

        def canShip(self, weights: list[int], capacity: int, D: int) -> bool:
            days = 1  # Start with one day
            currentWeight = 0  # Current weight loaded on the ship
        
            for weight in weights:
                if currentWeight + weight > capacity:
                    days += 1  # Need a new day
                    currentWeight = weight  # Start loading the new day with the current weight
                else:
                    currentWeight += weight  # Continue loading the current day
        
            return days <= D  # Check if we can ship within the allowed days
