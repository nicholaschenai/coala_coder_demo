    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   Chef needs to fence a rectangular area that covers a set of points on a 2D plane. The rectangle must have one of its sides aligned with a slope defined by a favorite number M. The goal is to calculate the minimum perimeter of such a rectangle that can enclose all the given points.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - First, we need to transform the coordinates of the points based on the slope M. This can be done by rotating the coordinate system so that one side of the rectangle aligns with the slope M.\n   - After transforming the points, we can find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the transformed points.\n   - The perimeter of the rectangle can then be calculated using the formula: `Perimeter = 2 * (width + height)`, where width and height are derived from the transformed coordinates.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function calculate_perimeter(N, M, points):\n       transformed_points = []\n       for each point (x, y) in points:\n           new_x = x - M * y\n           new_y = M * x + y\n           transformed_points.append((new_x, new_y))\n       \n       min_x = min(transformed_points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]\n       max_x = max(transformed_points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]\n       min_y = min(transformed_points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]\n       max_y = max(transformed_points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]\n       \n       width = max_x - min_x\n       height = max_y - min_y\n       perimeter = 2 * (width + height)\n       return perimeter\n\n   function main():\n       read N and M\n       read points\n       perimeter = calculate_perimeter(N, M, points)\n       print perimeter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef calculate_perimeter(N, M, points):\n    transformed_points = []\n    # Transform the points based on the slope M\n    for x, y in points:\n        new_x = x - M * y  # Rotate the point\n        new_y = M * x + y  # Rotate the point\n        transformed_points.append((new_x, new_y))\n    \n    # Find the min and max x and y coordinates in the transformed space\n    min_x = min(transformed_points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]\n    max_x = max(transformed_points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]\n    min_y = min(transformed_points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]\n    max_y = max(transformed_points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]\n    \n    # Calculate width and height of the rectangle\n    width = max_x - min_x\n    height = max_y - min_y\n    # Calculate the perimeter\n    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)\n    return perimeter\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    # Read N and M\n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    N = int(first_line[0])\n    M = float(first_line[1])\n    \n    points = []\n    # Read the points\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        x, y = map(int, data[i].split())\n        points.append((x, y))\n    \n    # Calculate the perimeter\n    perimeter = calculate_perimeter(N, M, points)\n    # Print the perimeter with sufficient precision\n    print(f\"{perimeter:.12f}\")\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n```",
