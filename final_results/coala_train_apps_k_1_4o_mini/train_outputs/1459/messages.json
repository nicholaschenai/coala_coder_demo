But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built $N$ walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.\n        Formally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin $(0, 0)$. There are $N$ walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points $(a_i, 0)$ and $(0, a_i)$. For every initial position of Chef $(x_j, y_j)$, find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if $(x_j, y_j)$ lies on any of the given walls, print $-1$ in a new line.\n\n        -----Input-----\n        - First line contains $T$, denoting the number of testcases.\n        - The first line of every test case contains a single integer $N$ denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.\n        - The next line contains $N$ space separated distinct integers each denoting $a_i$.\n        - The next line contains a single integer $Q$ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.\n        - The next $Q$ lines contains two space separated integers $x_j$ and $y_j$, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.\n\n        -----Output-----\n        For each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line.

Each wall is represented by a line segment that connects two points on the axes. For each starting position of Chef, we need to check if he is on a wall, and if not, count how many walls he would need to break to reach the origin.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n           - For each test case, read the number of walls and their respective positions.\n           - For each query (Chef's starting position), check if the position lies on any wall. If it does, return -1.\n           - If not on a wall, determine how many walls Chef would need to break through to reach the origin.

The transformation used was:\n   - `new_x = x - M * y`\n   - `new_y = M * x + y`\n   \n   However, this transformation does not correctly represent the rotation needed to align the rectangle with the slope M. The correct transformation should involve a rotation matrix that accounts for the angle corresponding to the slope M.\n\n2. **Calculating the Perimeter:**\n   After transforming the points, the code attempts to find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates to calculate the width and height of the rectangle. However, if the transformation is incorrect, the calculated perimeter will also be incorrect.\n\n3. **Identifying the Mistake:**\n   The main mistake lies in the transformation of the points. The transformation should be based on the angle derived from the slope M, which can be calculated using the arctangent function. The correct transformation should involve rotating the points by the angle `theta` where `tan(theta) = M`.\n\n4. **Correcting the Transformation:**\n   To correctly transform the points, we need to:\n   - Calculate the angle `theta` using `atan(M)`.\n   - Use the rotation matrix to transform the points:\n     ```\n     new_x = x * cos(theta) + y * sin(theta)\n     new_y = -x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)\n     ```\n\n5. **Revising the Code:**\n   We need to implement the correct transformation and then recalculate the perimeter based on the transformed points.\n\nNow, let's implement the corrected solution in Python.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_perimeter(N, M, points):\n    transformed_points = []\n    # Calculate the angle theta from the slope M\n    theta = math.atan(M)\n    cos_theta = math.cos(theta)\n    sin_theta = math.sin(theta)\n    \n    # Transform the points based on the angle theta\n    for x, y in points:\n        new_x = x * cos_theta + y * sin_theta  # Rotate the point\n        new_y = -x * sin_theta + y * cos_theta  # Rotate the point\n        transformed_points.append((new_x, new_y))\n    \n    # Find the min and max x and y coordinates in the transformed space\n    min_x = min(transformed_points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]\n    max_x = max(transformed_points, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]\n    min_y = min(transformed_points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]\n    max_y = max(transformed_points, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]\n    \n    # Calculate width and height of the rectangle\n    width = max_x - min_x\n    height = max_y - min_y\n    # Calculate the perimeter\n    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)\n    return perimeter\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    # Read N and M\n    first_line = data[0].split()\n    N = int(first_line[0])\n    M = float(first_line[1])\n    \n    points = []\n    # Read the points\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        x, y = map(int, data[i].split())\n        points.append((x, y))\n    \n    # Calculate the perimeter\n    perimeter = calculate_perimeter(N, M, points)\n    # Print the perimeter with sufficient precision\n    print(f\"{perimeter:.12f}\")\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n``` \n\nThis revised code correctly transforms the points based on the slope M and calculates the perimeter of the rectangle that can enclose all the points."

The key concept was recognizing that the multiples of 10 form an arithmetic series, which can be efficiently summed using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\n\n    The solution involved determining the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N, calculating the number of terms in the series, and then applying the sum formula. The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the constraints provided.\n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):\n        largest_multiple = (N // 10) * 10\n        number_of_terms = largest_multiple // 10\n        sum = (number_of_terms * (10 + largest_multiple)) // 2\n        return sum\n\n    T = int(input())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        result = sum_of_multiples_of_10(N)\n        print(result)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in mathematical problems and leveraging formulas for efficiency, especially when dealing with potentially large inputs. No unexpected errors occurred during the implementation, and the solution passed all test cases successfully.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The key challenge was to correctly transform the coordinates of the points based on the slope to ensure the rectangle was properly oriented.\n\nInitially, the transformation used was incorrect, leading to inaccurate perimeter calculations. The transformation should have involved a rotation based on the angle derived from the slope M using the arctangent function. The correct transformation utilized the rotation matrix to align the points with the desired slope.\n\nThe final solution involved calculating the angle `theta` using `math.atan(M)` and applying the rotation matrix:\n```python\nnew_x = x * cos(theta) + y * sin(theta)\nnew_y = -x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)\n```\nAfter transforming the points, the minimum and maximum coordinates were found to compute the width and height of the rectangle, leading to the correct perimeter calculation.\n\nThe final code successfully passed all tests, demonstrating the importance of correctly aligning the coordinate transformation with the problem's requirements.

        "content": "In reflecting on my attempts to solve the problem, I learned several key insights that can be useful for future reference:\n\n1. **Transformation Approach**: The official solution uses a more straightforward approach to transform the points based on the slope M. It calculates the hypotenuse using `hyp = sqrt(1 + m*m)` and derives the cosine and sine values directly from this hypotenuse. This method simplifies the transformation of the points into a rotated coordinate system.\n\n2. **Efficient Point Transformation**: The official solution efficiently transforms the points into a new coordinate system using:\n   ```python\n   pts[0].append(cosx * px + sinx * py)\n   pts[1].append(cosx * py - sinx * px)\n   ```\n   This approach effectively rotates the points without needing to calculate the angle explicitly, which can save computation time and reduce complexity.\n\n3. **Bounding Rectangle Calculation**: After transforming the points, the official solution calculates the width and length of the bounding rectangle using:\n   ```python\n   w = max(pts[0]) - min(pts[0])\n   l = max(pts[1]) - min(pts[1])\n   ```\n   This is a clear and efficient way to determine the dimensions of the rectangle that will enclose all the points.\n\n4. **Final Perimeter Calculation**: The perimeter is calculated simply as `print(2*l + 2*w)`, which is straightforward and efficient.\n\nOverall, the official solution is more concise and leverages mathematical properties effectively to achieve the desired result. My initial approach was overly complicated in terms of transformations and did not utilize the properties of the slope effectively. This experience highlights the importance of understanding geometric transformations and leveraging mathematical relationships to simplify problems."

The width and height of this rectangle are computed, and subsequently, the perimeter is calculated using these dimensions. Finally, the function outputs the calculated perimeter with high precision.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to determine the minimum perimeter of a rectangle that can enclose a set of points in a 2D space, particularly when the rectangle must be oriented at a specific angle defined by a slope. This can be applicable in fields such as computational geometry, robotics (for path planning), computer graphics (for bounding boxes), and geographical information systems (GIS) where spatial data needs to be analyzed and enclosed efficiently. Additionally, it can be beneficial in optimization problems where minimizing the enclosing shape's perimeter is crucial."
