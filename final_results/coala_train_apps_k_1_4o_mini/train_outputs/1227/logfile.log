## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
One day, Chef found a cube which has each of its sides painted in some color out of black, blue, red, green, yellow and orange.
Now he asks you to check if he can choose three sides such that they are pairwise adjacent and painted in the same color.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- A single line of each test case contains six words denoting the colors of painted sides in the order: front, back, left, right, top and bottom, respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing the word "YES" or "NO" (without quotes) corresponding to the answer of the problem.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤  50000 
- Each color will be from the list {"black", "blue", "red", "green", "yellow", "orange"}

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask 1: (25 points)
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤  12000

INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem requires us to determine if there are three adjacent sides of a cube that are painted the same color. Each test case provides the colors of the six sides of the cube, and we need to check for each test case if such a triplet of adjacent sides exists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to identify the sets of three sides that are adjacent to each other on a cube. The pairs of adjacent sides can be grouped as follows:
   - Front, Left, Top
   - Front, Right, Top
   - Back, Left, Top
   - Back, Right, Top
   - Front, Left, Bottom
   - Front, Right, Bottom
   - Back, Left, Bottom
   - Back, Right, Bottom

   For each test case, we will check if any of these groups of three sides have the same color. If we find at least one such group, we will output "YES"; otherwise, we will output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function check_adjacent_colors(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read colors for front, back, left, right, top, bottom
           check the following combinations:
               if (front == left == top) or
                  (front == right == top) or
                  (back == left == top) or
                  (back == right == top) or
                  (front == left == bottom) or
                  (front == right == bottom) or

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the key concept revolves around the distribution of apples into boxes by two different candidates. The first candidate distributes apples evenly, while the second candidate may create uneven distributions depending on the values of N (total apples) and K (number of boxes). The main insight is that if K equals N, the second candidate can also achieve an even distribution, leading to different possible outcomes. If K is less than N, the distributions will always be the same.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases and checking the relationship between N and K. The implementation was straightforward, using a simple conditional check to determine the output for each test case.

    The final code effectively handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that the results were printed correctly based on the conditions established. The solution was efficient and adhered to the constraints provided, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's requirements. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case
            if K == N:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        test_cases.append((N, K))

    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of analyzing the problem's conditions and understanding how different scenarios can affect the outcome.

INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine if three pairwise adjacent sides of a cube could be painted the same color based on given inputs. The solution involved identifying specific combinations of adjacent sides and checking if any of those combinations had the same color.

The core concept was to recognize the adjacency of cube sides and efficiently check for color matches among those sides. The combinations to check were derived from the cube's geometry, ensuring that all possible adjacent triplets were considered.

The implemented solution successfully read multiple test cases, extracted the colors for each side, and checked the defined combinations. The function `check_adjacent_colors` was structured to iterate through the test cases and print "YES" or "NO" based on the findings.

The final code snippet is as follows:

```python
def check_adjacent_colors(test_cases):
    for colors in test_cases:
        front, back, left, right, top, bottom = colors
        
        if (front == left == top) or (front == right == top) or \
           (front == left == bottom) or (front == right == bottom) or \
           (back == left == top) or (back == right == top) or \
           (back == left == bottom) or (back == right == bottom):
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    colors = input().split()
    test_cases.append(colors)

check_adjacent_colors(test_cases)
```

This experience reinforced the importance of understanding geometric relationships in problems and how to efficiently check conditions based on those relationships. The solution was straightforward and effective, with no unexpected errors encountered.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1227 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem involves checking if it is possible to select three adjacent sides of a cube that are all painted the same color. Each cube has six sides, and the colors of these sides are provided as input. We need to determine for multiple test cases whether such a selection is possible.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to identify the pairs of adjacent sides on a cube. The pairs of adjacent sides that can be selected are:
   - Front, Left, Top
   - Front, Right, Top
   - Front, Left, Bottom
   - Front, Right, Bottom
   - Back, Left, Top
   - Back, Right, Top
   - Back, Left, Bottom
   - Back, Right, Bottom

   For each test case, we will check if any of these combinations of three sides have the same color. If at least one combination matches, we will output "YES"; otherwise, we will output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function check_adjacent_colors(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read colors of the six sides
           check the following combinations:
               - front, left, top
               - front, right, top
               - front, left, bottom

               - back, left, bottom
               - back, right, bottom
           if any combination has the same color:
               output "YES"
           else:
               output "NO"

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for _ in range(int(input())):
 l=list(map(str,input().split()))
 a=[(1,3,5),(1,3,6),(1,4,5),(1,4,6),(2,3,5),(2,3,6),(2,4,5),(2,4,6)]
 c=0
 for i in a:
  if len(set([l[i[0]-1],l[i[1]-1],l[i[2]-1]]))==1:
   c=1
   break
 if c==1:
  print("YES")
 else:
  print("NO")


INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] The official solution effectively checks for three adjacent sides of a cube that are painted the same color by using a list of tuples to represent the indices of the sides. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's set data structure to determine if all three selected sides share the same color.

Key insights from the official solution:

1. **Indexing with Tuples**: The solution uses a list of tuples to define the combinations of adjacent sides. Each tuple contains the indices of the sides, which simplifies the checking process.

2. **Set for Uniqueness**: By converting the selected sides into a set, the solution can easily check if all three sides are the same color. If the length of the set is 1, it indicates that all three colors are identical.

3. **Early Exit**: The use of a break statement allows the function to exit early once a valid combination is found, which can save time in cases where a match is found early in the list.

4. **Simplicity and Clarity**: The solution is concise and clear, making it easy to understand the logic behind checking the colors.

In contrast, my initial approach was more verbose and did not utilize the efficiency of sets or the clarity of indexed tuples. While my solution was correct, it could have been optimized by adopting similar strategies as the official solution. The official solution's method of using a list of tuples for combinations and checking with a set is a more elegant and efficient way to solve the problem.
