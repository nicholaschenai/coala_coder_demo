The first candidate distributes apples evenly, while the second candidate may create uneven distributions depending on the values of N (total apples) and K (number of boxes). The main insight is that if K equals N, the second candidate can also achieve an even distribution, leading to different possible outcomes. If K is less than N, the distributions will always be the same.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases and checking the relationship between N and K. The implementation was straightforward, using a simple conditional check to determine the output for each test case.\n\n    The final code effectively handled the input and output requirements, ensuring that the results were printed correctly based on the conditions established. The solution was efficient and adhered to the constraints provided, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's requirements. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            if K == N:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        test_cases.append((N, K))\n\n    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of analyzing the problem's conditions and understanding how different scenarios can affect the outcome.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
