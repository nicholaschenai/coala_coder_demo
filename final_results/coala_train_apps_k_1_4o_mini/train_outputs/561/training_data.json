    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money exactly according to the demands of the minions. The key requirements were that the total demand from the minions must equal the amount of money Gru has (K), and no individual demand should exceed K.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n1. **Total Demand vs. Available Money**: The primary check is whether the sum of all demands equals K.\n2. **Individual Demand Check**: Each minion's demand must not exceed K, but this check was not necessary for the problem as stated since the total demand check suffices.\n\n### Attempts and Errors:\n- The initial implementation correctly calculated the total demand but failed to produce the expected output due to misunderstanding the problem requirements. The output was \"NO\" for cases where it should have been \"YES\".\n- The logic was simplified to only check if the total demand matched K, which was the correct approach. However, I mistakenly added unnecessary checks that complicated the solution.\n\n### Final Working Code:\n```python\ndef can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N, K = case[0], case[1]\n        demands = case[2]\n        total_demand = sum(demands)\n        if total_demand == K:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n# Read input\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    demands = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    test_cases.append((N, K, demands))\n\ncan_distribute_money(T, test_cases)\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe main takeaway is to focus on the problem requirements and ensure that the logic aligns with those requirements. The final solution effectively checks if the total demand matches the available money, which is the crux of the problem.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\nIn my attempts to solve the problem of determining if Gru can distribute his money according to the demands of the minions, I initially focused on checking if the total demand matched the amount of money Gru had. However, this approach was insufficient because it did not account for the possibility of fulfilling the demands in a way that exactly matches the available money. \n\nThe official solution takes a different approach by using a recursive function to find all combinations of demands that sum up to the available money (K). This method effectively explores all possible subsets of the demands, allowing it to determine if any combination can exactly match K. The key insight here is that simply checking the total demand is not enough; we need to consider the various ways the demands can be combined.\n\nThe official solution's use of recursion to explore combinations is a more comprehensive approach, albeit potentially less efficient for larger inputs due to its exponential time complexity. In contrast, my initial solution was straightforward but ultimately incorrect because it failed to account for the combinatorial nature of the problem.\n\nIn future problem-solving scenarios, I will ensure to consider not just the total sums but also the various combinations that can lead to the desired outcome, especially in cases where exact matches are required.",
