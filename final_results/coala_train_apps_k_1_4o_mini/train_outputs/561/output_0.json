    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The problem involves a group of minions who each want money to decorate their houses. Gru has a limited amount of money to distribute among them. The goal is to determine if Gru can distribute all of his money exactly according to the demands of the minions. If he can distribute all of his money without any leftover, we should output \"YES\"; otherwise, we output \"NO\".\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   For each test case, we need to:\n   - Read the number of minions and the total amount of money Gru has.\n   - Read the list of money demands from each minion.\n   - Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions.\n   - Compare this total with the amount of money Gru has. If they are equal, output \"YES\". If not, output \"NO\".\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read N and K from test_case\n           read demands list A from test_case\n           total_demand = sum of elements in A\n           if total_demand == K:\n               print \"YES\"\n           else:\n               print \"NO\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n    # Iterate through each test case\n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Read the number of minions (N) and the amount of money Gru has (K)\n        N, K = case[0], case[1]\n        # Read the demands of each minion\n        demands = case[2]\n        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions\n        total_demand = sum(demands)\n        # Check if the total demand matches the money Gru has\n        if total_demand == K:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n# Read input\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    # Read N and K\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    # Read the demands\n    demands = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    # Store the test case\n    test_cases.append((N, K, demands))\n\n# Call the function with the number of test cases and the list of test cases\ncan_distribute_money(T, test_cases)\n```",
