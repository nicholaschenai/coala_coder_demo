    "raw_msg": "Based on the insights and corrections needed from the previous attempts, here is the revised solution for the problem of determining if Gru can distribute his money exactly according to the demands of the minions. The key is to ensure that the total demand matches the amount of money Gru has.\n\nHere\u2019s the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n    # Iterate through each test case\n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Read the number of minions (N) and the amount of money Gru has (K)\n        N, K = case[0], case[1]\n        # Read the demands of each minion\n        demands = case[2]\n        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions\n        total_demand = sum(demands)\n        # Check if the total demand matches the money Gru has\n        if total_demand == K:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n# Read input\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    # Read N and K\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    # Read the demands\n    demands = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    # Store the test case as a tuple\n    test_cases.append((N, K, demands))\n\n# Call the function with the number of test cases and the list of test cases\ncan_distribute_money(T, test_cases)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `can_distribute_money` takes the number of test cases and a list of test cases.\n2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it extracts the number of minions (N) and the amount of money Gru has (K).\n3. **Calculate Total Demand**: It sums up the demands of the minions.\n4. **Comparison**: It checks if the total demand equals the amount of money Gru has. If they are equal, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n5. **Input Handling**: The input is read in a structured way, ensuring that each test case is stored correctly.\n\nThis code should now correctly handle the input and output the expected results for each test case.",
