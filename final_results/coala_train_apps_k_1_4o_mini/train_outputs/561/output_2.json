    "raw_msg": "Based on the insights gained from the previous attempts and the memories provided, I will now correct the solution to the problem of determining if Gru can distribute his money exactly according to the demands of the minions. \n\nThe key points to consider are:\n1. Gru can only distribute money if the total demand from the minions matches the amount of money he has (K).\n2. Each individual demand must not exceed the amount of money Gru has (K).\n\nHere\u2019s the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n    # Iterate through each test case\n    for case in test_cases:\n        # Read the number of minions (N) and the amount of money Gru has (K)\n        N, K = case[0], case[1]\n        # Read the demands of each minion\n        demands = case[2]\n        # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by all minions\n        total_demand = sum(demands)\n        # Check if the total demand matches the money Gru has\n        if total_demand == K:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n# Read input\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    # Read N and K\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    # Read the demands\n    demands = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    # Store the test case as a tuple\n    test_cases.append((N, K, demands))\n\n# Call the function with the number of test cases and the list of test cases\ncan_distribute_money(T, test_cases)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `can_distribute_money` processes each test case.\n2. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of minions (N) and the total money Gru has (K), along with the demands from the minions.\n3. **Total Demand Calculation**: It calculates the total demand from the minions.\n4. **Comparison Logic**: It checks if the total demand equals K. If it does, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis code should now correctly handle the input and output the expected results for each test case, ensuring that Gru can distribute his money according to the demands of the minions.",
