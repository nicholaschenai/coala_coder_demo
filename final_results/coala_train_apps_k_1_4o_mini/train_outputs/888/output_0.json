    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We have a string `S` that is used to create an infinite pyramid of rows, where the N-th row contains N characters formed by repeating the string `S` cyclically. We also have another string `T`, and we need to answer multiple queries about how many times `T` appears as a substring in the N-th row of the pyramid.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Determine the length of the N-th row, which is simply N.\n   - Construct the N-th row by taking the first N characters from the cyclic repetition of `S`.\n   - Count the occurrences of the string `T` in this row. This involves checking all possible starting positions in the row and seeing if the substring matches `T`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_occurrences(S, T, N):\n       row_length = N\n       row = construct_row(S, row_length)\n       return count_substring_occurrences(row, T)\n\n   function construct_row(S, length):\n       result = \"\"\n       for i from 0 to length - 1:\n           result += S[i % len(S)]\n       return result\n\n   function count_substring_occurrences(row, T):\n       count = 0\n       for i from 0 to len(row) - len(T):\n           if row[i:i + len(T)] == T:\n               count += 1\n       return count\n\n   read S\n   read T\n   read Q\n   for each query:\n       read N\n       print count_occurrences(S, T, N)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef construct_row(S, length):\n    # Construct the N-th row of the pyramid by repeating S cyclically\n    result = \"\"\n    for i in range(length):\n        result += S[i % len(S)]\n    return result\n\ndef count_substring_occurrences(row, T):\n    # Count occurrences of string T in the given row\n    count = 0\n    len_T = len(T)\n    for i in range(len(row) - len_T + 1):\n        if row[i:i + len_T] == T:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef count_occurrences(S, T, N):\n    # Count occurrences of T in the N-th row of the pyramid\n    row_length = N\n    row = construct_row(S, row_length)\n    return count_substring_occurrences(row, T)\n\n# Read input strings S and T\nS = input().strip()\nT = input().strip()\n# Read number of queries Q\nQ = int(input().strip())\n# Process each query\nfor _ in range(Q):\n    N = int(input().strip())\n    # Print the result for each query\n    print(count_occurrences(S, T, N))\n```",
