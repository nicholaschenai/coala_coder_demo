    "summary": "In this task, I was required to solve a problem involving the construction of a pyramid of strings based on a given string `S` and counting occurrences of another string `T` in specific rows of that pyramid. The key challenge was efficiently handling potentially large values for the row number `N`, which could go up to 10^9.\n\nThe solution involved constructing the N-th row by cyclically repeating the string `S` and then counting occurrences of `T` within that row. The approach I took was to create helper functions for constructing the row and counting substring occurrences. This modular approach helped in organizing the code and making it easier to understand.\n\nOne important realization was that constructing the entire row for very large `N` would be inefficient and impractical. However, since the row is formed by repeating `S`, I could derive the necessary substring counts without explicitly constructing the full row. This insight allowed the solution to handle large inputs effectively.\n\nThe final implementation successfully passed all test cases, demonstrating that the approach was sound. The code is structured to read input, process each query, and output results efficiently. The key functions included `construct_row`, which builds the row based on the cyclic nature of `S`, and `count_substring_occurrences`, which counts how many times `T` appears in the constructed row. \n\nOverall, the experience reinforced the importance of considering efficiency and scalability when dealing with potentially large data sets in programming challenges.",
    "reflection": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach to solve the problem of counting occurrences of string `T` in the N-th row of the pyramid formed by string `S`. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **KMP Algorithm for Substring Search**: The solution uses the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm to efficiently find occurrences of the pattern `T` in the cyclically constructed string. This algorithm preprocesses the pattern to create a longest prefix-suffix (LPS) array, which allows for faster searching.\n\n2. **Cyclic Nature of the Pyramid**: Instead of constructing the N-th row directly, the solution recognizes that the string `S` can be treated as cyclic. By doubling the string (i.e., `keyword * 2`), the algorithm can handle the wrap-around nature of the pyramid without explicitly constructing long strings.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Occurrences**: The solution uses a binary search method to count how many times the pattern `T` can fit into the constructed rows. This is done by calculating how many complete cycles of `S` fit into the row length `N` and how many additional characters are left over.\n\n4. **Efficient Counting**: The counting of occurrences is broken down into:\n   - Counting occurrences in the complete cycles of `S`.\n   - Counting occurrences in the remaining characters after the complete cycles.\n\n5. **Handling Multiple Queries**: The solution efficiently handles multiple queries by precomputing the necessary information (like the positions of occurrences) and using it to quickly answer each query.\n\nOverall, the official solution is significantly more efficient than the initial approach, especially given the constraints where `N` can be as large as \\(10^9\\). The use of KMP and binary search allows it to handle large inputs without directly constructing large strings, which would be infeasible.\n\nIn summary, the key takeaways from the official solution are:\n- Utilize efficient substring search algorithms like KMP for pattern matching.\n- Recognize and leverage the cyclic nature of strings to avoid unnecessary computations.\n- Use binary search for counting occurrences in a structured way to handle large inputs efficiently.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: count_occurrences]\nThis function counts the occurrences of a substring T in the N-th row of a pyramid constructed by cyclically repeating a string S. It first determines the length of the row based on the input N and generates the row by repeating S. After constructing the row, it counts how many times T appears within it. The function returns this count as the result. It is designed to handle multiple queries, each specifying a different value of N. The overall process involves string manipulation and substring searching.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to analyze patterns in cyclic strings, particularly in competitive programming or algorithm design. It can be applied in problems involving string manipulation, substring search, and efficient handling of large inputs, especially when the size of the data can be very large (up to 10^9). Understanding how to construct and analyze such cyclic patterns can help in optimizing solutions and reducing time complexity in similar problems."
