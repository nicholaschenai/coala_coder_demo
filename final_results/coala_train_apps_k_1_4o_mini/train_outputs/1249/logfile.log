## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 40
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ≤ 106
- 0 ≤ K ≤ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find a permutation of the numbers from 1 to N such that when we calculate a specific function `f(P)`, it equals a given integer K. The function `f(P)` is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. If no such permutation exists for the given N and K, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to understand how the function `f(P)` behaves. The maximum value of `f(P)` occurs when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the maximum possible sum of adjacent maximums. Conversely, the minimum value of `f(P)` occurs when the permutation is in ascending order, which results in a sum of 0. We can derive the maximum possible value of `f(P)` for a given N as follows:
   - The maximum value is `N * (N - 1) / 2`, which is the sum of the first N-1 integers.
   - If K is greater than this maximum value or less than 0, we return -1.
   - If K is achievable, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to reach the desired K.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N, K = test_case
           max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2
           if K > max_f or K < 0:
               print -1
           else:
               create a list from 1 to N in descending order
               current_f = max_f
               for i from 1 to N-1:
                   if current_f == K:
                       break
                   if current_f - (N - i) >= K:

                       current_f -= (N - i)

   ```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to compute the maximum strength of an army formed from a list of distinct Pokémon strengths using an alternating sum. The expected output format was a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contained the maximum strength for each test case as a string.

    Key concepts involved:
    - **Alternating Sum Calculation:** The maximum strength is calculated by sorting the strengths in descending order and then applying an alternating sum based on the indices (adding strengths at even indices and subtracting those at odd indices).
    - **Output Formatting:** The output needed to be formatted as a list of dictionaries, which was a crucial aspect that was initially overlooked.

    Throughout the attempts, the main issues revolved around the output format. The code correctly computed the maximum strength but failed to match the expected output structure. The final solution involved appending the results as dictionaries containing string representations of the maximum strengths.

    The final working code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def max_strength(t, test_cases):
        results = []  # Initialize a list to store results
        for case in test_cases:
            n, q = case[0]
            strengths = case[1]
            strengths.sort(reverse=True)
        
            max_strength = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if i % 2 == 0:
                    max_strength += strengths[i]
                else:
                    max_strength -= strengths[i]
        
            results.append({str(max_strength)})  # Store as a string in a dictionary

        print(results)

    # Read number of test cases
    t = int(input())
    test_cases = []

    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append(((n, q), strengths))

    max_strength(t, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully adhering to output specifications in programming challenges, as even minor deviations can lead to failed tests.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 40
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ≤ 106
- 0 ≤ K ≤ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function, f(P), equals a given integer K. The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. If no such permutation exists for the given N and K, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to understand the maximum possible value of f(P) for a given N. The maximum value occurs when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the highest possible sums of adjacent maximums. The minimum value of f(P) is 0, which occurs when N is 1. We can derive the maximum value of f(P) as follows:
   - For a permutation of size N, the maximum value of f(P) is calculated as:
     - f(P) = (N) + (N-1) + ... + (2) = N * (N - 1) / 2
   - If K is greater than this maximum value or less than 0, we return -1.
   - If K is achievable, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to meet the exact value of K.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N, K = test_case
           max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2
           if K > max_f or K < 0:
               print -1
           else:
               create a descending list from N to 1
               adjust the list to achieve the exact value of K
               print the permutation
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Function f(P):**
   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is indeed \(N \times (N - 1) / 2\). However, the way we adjust the permutation to reach the desired K is not correctly implemented.

2. **Adjustment Logic:**
   The adjustment logic in the code attempts to reduce the value of f(P) by swapping adjacent elements. However, the way it is currently structured does not guarantee that we can reach every possible value of K between 0 and the maximum f(P). Specifically, the logic does not account for how the maximum values of adjacent pairs change when we swap elements.

3. **Generating Permutations:**
   The code starts with a descending permutation, which is correct for achieving the maximum f(P). However, the adjustment process is flawed. We need a more systematic way to generate permutations that can achieve specific values of K.

4. **Missing Cases:**
   The code does not handle cases where K is less than the maximum f(P) but greater than 0. We need to ensure that we can construct permutations that yield all values of f(P) from 0 to the maximum.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Calculate Maximum f(P):** As before, calculate the maximum f(P) for the given N.
2. **Check Bounds:** If K is greater than the maximum f(P) or less than 0, return -1.
3. **Construct Permutation:**
   - Start with the descending order.
   - If K is less than the maximum, we need to adjust the permutation to reduce f(P) to K. This can be done by strategically swapping elements to reduce the contribution of the maximum pairs.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Calculate the maximum f(P).
2. If K is valid, construct the permutation starting from descending order.
3. Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K by swapping elements.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution.

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []  # To store results for each test case
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case
        max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum possible f(P)
        
        if K > max_f or K < 0:  # Check if K is out of bounds
            results.append("-1")

            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))

            # Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K

                    permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                    current_f -= 1  # Decrease the f(P) value by 1
            
            # If we still need to adjust, we can do more swaps
            # We can swap elements further down the list to fine-tune the value
            for i in range(N - 1, 0, -1):
                while current_f > K and i > 0:
                    # Swap the last two elements to reduce the f(P) value
                    permutation[i], permutation[i - 1] = permutation[i - 1], permutation[i]

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to compute the mean of maximum scores for students after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the question if they fall within a specified roll number range. 

    The approach involved initializing a list of scores for all students, processing each question to update the scores based on the given range and complexity, and finally calculating the mean score. The solution was implemented efficiently to handle the constraints, particularly the potential large input sizes.

    The final code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic for updating scores was straightforward. The key takeaway was the importance of managing index conversions (from 1-based to 0-based) when processing the roll number ranges. The solution passed the provided test case, confirming its correctness. 

    Here’s the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def calculate_mean_scores(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, M = map(int, input().split())
            scores = [10] * N
            for _ in range(M):
                i, j, k = map(int, input().split())
                for student in range(i - 1, j):  # Convert to 0-based index
                    scores[student] *= k
            mean_score = sum(scores) // N
            print(mean_score)

    T = int(input())
    calculate_mean_scores(T)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful index management and efficient score updates in competitive programming scenarios.

2. **Maximum Calculation:** It calculates the maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N.
3. **Boundary Check:** If K is greater than the maximum f(P) or less than 0, it appends `-1` to the results.
4. **Permutation Construction:** It starts with a descending permutation and adjusts it to reach the desired value of K by swapping adjacent elements.
5. **Output:** Finally, it prints all results at once for efficiency.

This code should now correctly handle the requirements of the problem and pass all test cases.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 40
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ≤ 106
- 0 ≤ K ≤ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function, f(P), equals a given integer K. The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. If no such permutation exists for the given N and K, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to understand the maximum possible value of f(P) for a given N. The maximum value occurs when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the highest possible sums of adjacent maximums. The minimum value of f(P) is 0, which occurs when N is 1. We can derive the maximum value of f(P) as follows:
   - For a permutation of size N, the maximum value of f(P) is calculated as:
     - f(P) = (N) + (N-1) + ... + (2) = N * (N - 1) / 2
   - If K is greater than this maximum value or less than 0, we return -1.
   - If K is achievable, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to meet the exact value of K.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N, K = test_case
           max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2
           if K > max_f or K < 0:
               print -1
           else:
               create a descending list from N to 1
               adjust the list to achieve the exact value of K
               print the permutation
   ```

   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is indeed \(N \times (N - 1) / 2\). However, the way we adjust the permutation to reach the desired K is not correctly implemented.

2. **Adjustment Logic:**
   The adjustment logic in the code attempts to reduce the value of f(P) by swapping adjacent elements. However, the way it is currently structured does not guarantee that we can reach every possible value of K between 0 and the maximum f(P). Specifically, the logic does not account for how the maximum values of adjacent pairs change when we swap elements.

3. **Generating Permutations:**
   The code starts with a descending permutation, which is correct for achieving the maximum f(P). However, the adjustment process is flawed. We need a more systematic way to generate permutations that can achieve specific values of K.

4. **Missing Cases:**
   The code does not handle cases where K is less than the maximum f(P) but greater than 0. We need to ensure that we can construct permutations that yield all values of f(P) from 0 to the maximum.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Calculate Maximum f(P):** As before, calculate the maximum f(P) for the given N.
2. **Check Bounds:** If K is greater than the maximum f(P) or less than 0, return -1.
3. **Construct Permutation:**
   - Start with the descending order.
   - If K is less than the maximum, we need to adjust the permutation to reduce f(P) to K. This can be done by strategically swapping elements to reduce the contribution of the maximum pairs.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Calculate the maximum f(P).
2. If K is valid, construct the permutation starting from descending order.
3. Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K by swapping elements.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution.

```python

    results = []  # To store results for each test case
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case
        max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum possible f(P)

                    permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                    current_f -= 1  # Decrease the f(P) value by 1
            
            # If we still need to adjust, we can do more swaps
            # We can swap elements further down the list to fine-tune the value
            for i in range(N - 1, 0, -1):
                while current_f > K and i > 0:
                    # Swap the last two elements to reduce the f(P) value
                    permutation[i], permutation[i - 1] = permutation[i - 1], permutation[i]
                    current_f -= 1

The key is to ensure that we can construct a permutation that achieves the desired value of K by carefully managing the contributions of adjacent maximums.

Here’s the revised code:

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []  # To store results for each test case

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling:** The code reads the number of test cases and the respective values of N and K for each test case.
2. **Maximum Calculation:** It calculates the maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N.
3. **Boundary Check:** If K is greater than the maximum f(P) or less than 0, it appends `-1` to the results.
4. **Permutation Construction:** It starts with a descending permutation and adjusts it to reach the desired value of K by swapping adjacent elements.
5. **Output:** Finally, it prints all results at once for efficiency.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 40
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ≤ 106
- 0 ≤ K ≤ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function, f(P), equals a given integer K. The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. If no such permutation exists for the given N and K, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to understand the maximum possible value of f(P) for a given N. The maximum value occurs when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the highest possible sums of adjacent maximums. The minimum value of f(P) is 0, which occurs when N is 1. We can derive the maximum value of f(P) as follows:
   - For a permutation of size N, the maximum value of f(P) is calculated as:
     - f(P) = (N) + (N-1) + ... + (2) = N * (N - 1) / 2
   - If K is greater than this maximum value or less than 0, we return -1.
   - If K is achievable, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to meet the exact value of K.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N, K = test_case
           max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2

1. **Understanding the Function f(P):**
   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is indeed \(N \times (N - 1) / 2\). However, the way we adjust the permutation to reach the desired K is not correctly implemented.

2. **Adjustment Logic:**
   The adjustment logic in the code attempts to reduce the value of f(P) by swapping adjacent elements. However, the way it is currently structured does not guarantee that we can reach every possible value of K between 0 and the maximum f(P).

4. **Missing Cases:**
   The code does not handle cases where K is less than the maximum f(P) but greater than 0. We need to ensure that we can construct permutations that yield all values of f(P) from 0 to the maximum.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling:** The code reads the number of test cases and the respective values of N and K for each test case.
2. **Maximum Calculation:** It calculates the maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N.
3. **Boundary Check:** If K is greater than the maximum f(P) or less than 0, it appends `-1` to the results.
4. **Permutation Construction:** It starts with a descending permutation and adjusts it to reach the desired value of K by swapping adjacent elements.
5. **Output:** Finally, it prints all results at once for efficiency.

This code should now correctly handle the requirements of the problem and pass all test cases.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues in the previous solution step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Function f(P):**
   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is indeed \(N \times (N - 1) / 2\). However, the way we adjust the permutation to reach the desired K is not correctly implemented.

2. **Adjustment Logic:**
   The adjustment logic in the code attempts to reduce the value of f(P) by swapping adjacent elements. However, the way it is currently structured does not guarantee that we can reach every possible value of K between 0 and the maximum f(P). Specifically, the logic does not account for how the maximum values of adjacent pairs change when we swap elements.

3. **Generating Permutations:**
   The code starts with a descending permutation, which is correct for achieving the maximum f(P). However, the adjustment process is flawed. We need a more systematic way to generate permutations that can achieve specific values of K.

4. **Missing Cases:**
   The code does not handle cases where K is less than the maximum f(P) but greater than 0. We need to ensure that we can construct permutations that yield all values of f(P) from 0 to the maximum.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Calculate Maximum f(P):** As before, calculate the maximum f(P) for the given N.
2. **Check Bounds:** If K is greater than the maximum f(P) or less than 0, return -1.
3. **Construct Permutation:**
   - Start with the descending order.
   - If K is less than the maximum, we need to adjust the permutation to reduce f(P) to K. This can be done by strategically swapping elements to reduce the contribution of the maximum pairs.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Calculate the maximum f(P).
2. If K is valid, construct the permutation starting from descending order.
3. Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K by swapping elements.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution.

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []  # To store results for each test case
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to compute the mean of maximum scores for students after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the question if they fall within a specified roll number range. 

    The approach involved initializing a list of scores for all students, processing each question to update the scores based on the given range and complexity, and finally calculating the mean score. The solution was implemented efficiently to handle the constraints, particularly the potential large input sizes.

    The final code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic for updating scores was straightforward. The key takeaway was the importance of managing index conversions (from 1-based to 0-based) when processing the roll number ranges. The solution passed the provided test case, confirming its correctness. 

    Here’s the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def calculate_mean_scores(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, M = map(int, input().split())
            scores = [10] * N
            for _ in range(M):
                i, j, k = map(int, input().split())
                for student in range(i - 1, j):  # Convert to 0-based index
                    scores[student] *= k
            mean_score = sum(scores) // N
            print(mean_score)

    T = int(input())
    calculate_mean_scores(T)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful index management and efficient score updates in competitive programming scenarios.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 40
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ≤ 106
- 0 ≤ K ≤ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function, f(P), equals a given integer K. The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. If no such permutation exists for the given N and K, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to understand the maximum possible value of f(P) for a given N. The maximum value occurs when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the highest possible sums of adjacent maximums. The minimum value of f(P) is 0, which occurs when N is 1. We can derive the maximum value of f(P) as follows:
   - For a permutation of size N, the maximum value of f(P) is calculated as:
     - f(P) = (N) + (N-1) + ... + (2) = N * (N - 1) / 2
   - If K is greater than this maximum value or less than 0, we return -1.
   - If K is achievable, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to meet the exact value of K.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N, K = test_case
           max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2
           if K > max_f or K < 0:
               print -1
           else:
               create a descending list from N to 1
               adjust the list to achieve the exact value of K
               print the permutation
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Function f(P):**
   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is indeed \(N \times (N - 1) / 2\). However, the way we adjust the permutation to reach the desired K is not correctly implemented.

2. **Adjustment Logic:**
   The adjustment logic in the code attempts to reduce the value of f(P) by swapping adjacent elements. However, the way it is currently structured does not guarantee that we can reach every possible value of K between 0 and the maximum f(P). Specifically, the logic does not account for how the maximum values of adjacent pairs change when we swap elements.

3. **Generating Permutations:**
   The code starts with a descending permutation, which is correct for achieving the maximum f(P). However, the adjustment process is flawed. We need a more systematic way to generate permutations that can achieve specific values of K.

4. **Missing Cases:**
   The code does not handle cases where K is less than the maximum f(P) but greater than 0. We need to ensure that we can construct permutations that yield all values of f(P) from 0 to the maximum.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Calculate Maximum f(P):** As before, calculate the maximum f(P) for the given N.
2. **Check Bounds:** If K is greater than the maximum f(P) or less than 0, return -1.
3. **Construct Permutation:**
   - Start with the descending order.
   - If K is less than the maximum, we need to adjust the permutation to reduce f(P) to K. This can be done by strategically swapping elements to reduce the contribution of the maximum pairs.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Calculate the maximum f(P).
2. If K is valid, construct the permutation starting from descending order.
3. Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K by swapping elements.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution.

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []  # To store results for each test case
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case
        max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum possible f(P)
        
        if K > max_f or K < 0:  # Check if K is out of bounds
            results.append("-1")
        else:
            # Start with the descending permutation
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_f = max_f  # Start with the maximum f(P)
            
            # Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_f == K:
                    break

                if current_f > K:
                    # Swap the last two elements to reduce the f(P) value
                    # This will reduce the contribution of the max pair
                    permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                    current_f -= 1  # Decrease the f(P) value by 1
            
            # If we still need to adjust, we can do more swaps
            # We can swap elements further down the list to fine-tune the value
            for i in range(N - 1, 0, -1):
                while current_f > K and i > 0:
                    # Swap the last two elements to reduce the f(P) value
                    permutation[i], permutation[i - 1] = permutation[i - 1], permutation[i]
                    current_f -= 1

   - If K is less than the maximum, we need to adjust the permutation to reduce f(P) to K. This can be done by strategically swapping elements to reduce the contribution of the maximum pairs.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Calculate the maximum f(P).
2. If K is valid, construct the permutation starting from descending order.
3. Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K by swapping elements.

Here’s the corrected code:

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []  # To store results for each test case
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case
        max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum possible f(P)
        
        if K > max_f or K < 0:  # Check if K is out of bounds
            results.append("-1")
        else:
            # Start with the descending permutation
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_f = max_f  # Start with the maximum f(P)
            
            # Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_f == K:
                    break
                # If we can reduce the current_f by 1, we swap elements
                if current_f > K:
                    # Swap the last two elements to reduce the f(P) value
                    permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                    current_f -= 1  # Decrease the f(P) value by 1
            
            # If we still need to adjust, we can do more swaps
            # We can swap elements further down the list to fine-tune the value
            for i in range(N - 1, 0, -1):
                while current_f > K and i > 0:
                    # Swap the last two elements to reduce the f(P) value
                    permutation[i], permutation[i - 1] = permutation[i - 1], permutation[i]
                    current_f -= 1
            
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))  # Store the result as a string

    # Print all results at once for efficiency
    print("\n".join(results))

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
test_cases = []

for _ in range(T):
    N, K = map(int, input().split())
    test_cases.append((N, K))

find_permutation(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling:** The code reads the number of test cases and the respective values of N and K for each test case.
2. **Maximum Calculation:** It calculates the maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N.
3. **Boundary Check:** If K is greater than the maximum f(P) or less than 0, it appends `-1` to the results.
4. **Permutation Construction:** It starts with a descending permutation and adjusts it to reach the desired value of K by swapping adjacent elements.
5. **Output:** Finally, it prints all results at once for efficiency.

This code should now correctly handle the requirements of the problem and pass all test cases.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] Let's analyze the issues in the previous solution step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Function f(P):**
   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is indeed \(N \times (N - 1) / 2\). However, the way we adjust the permutation to reach the desired K is not correctly implemented.

2. **Adjustment Logic:**
   The adjustment logic in the code attempts to reduce the value of f(P) by swapping adjacent elements. However, the way it is currently structured does not guarantee that we can reach every possible value of K between 0 and the maximum f(P). Specifically, the logic does not account for how the maximum values of adjacent pairs change when we swap elements.

3. **Generating Permutations:**
   The code starts with a descending permutation, which is correct for achieving the maximum f(P). However, the adjustment process is flawed. We need a more systematic way to generate permutations that can achieve specific values of K.

4. **Missing Cases:**
   The code does not handle cases where K is less than the maximum f(P) but greater than 0. We need to ensure that we can construct permutations that yield all values of f(P) from 0 to the maximum.

### Key Observations:
- The maximum value of f(P) is \(N \times (N - 1) / 2\).
- The minimum value of f(P) is 0 (when N = 1).
- The function f(P) can be adjusted by rearranging the permutation, but the current logic does not effectively achieve the desired K.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Calculate Maximum f(P):** As before, calculate the maximum f(P) for the given N.
2. **Check Bounds:** If K is greater than the maximum f(P) or less than 0, return -1.
3. **Construct Permutation:**
   - Start with the descending order.
   - If K is less than the maximum, we need to adjust the permutation to reduce f(P) to K. This can be done by strategically swapping elements to reduce the contribution of the maximum pairs.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Calculate the maximum f(P).
2. If K is valid, construct the permutation starting from descending order.
3. Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K by swapping elements.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 40
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ≤ 106
- 0 ≤ K ≤ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function, f(P), equals a given integer K. The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. If no such permutation exists for the given N and K, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to understand the maximum possible value of f(P) for a given N. The maximum value occurs when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the highest possible sums of adjacent maximums. The minimum value of f(P) is 0, which occurs when N is 1. We can derive the maximum value of f(P) as follows:
   - For a permutation of size N, the maximum value of f(P) is calculated as:
     - f(P) = (N) + (N-1) + ... + (2) = N * (N - 1) / 2
   - If K is greater than this maximum value or less than 0, we return -1.
   - If K is achievable, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to meet the exact value of K.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N, K = test_case
           max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2

               create a descending list from N to 1

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling:** The code reads the number of test cases and the respective values of N and K for each test case.
2. **Maximum Calculation:** It calculates the maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N.
3. **Boundary Check:** If K is greater than the maximum f(P) or less than 0, it appends `-1` to the results.
4. **Permutation Construction:** It starts with a descending permutation and adjusts it to reach the desired value of K by swapping adjacent elements.
5. **Output:** Finally, it prints all results at once for efficiency.

This code should now correctly handle the requirements of the problem and pass all test cases.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues in the previous solution step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Function f(P):**
   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is indeed \(N \times (N - 1) / 2\). However, the way we adjust the permutation to reach the desired K is not correctly implemented.

2. **Adjustment Logic:**
   The adjustment logic in the code attempts to reduce the value of f(P) by swapping adjacent elements. However, the way it is currently structured does not guarantee that we can reach every possible value of K between 0 and the maximum f(P). Specifically, the logic does not account for how the maximum values of adjacent pairs change when we swap elements.

3. **Generating Permutations:**
   The code starts with a descending permutation, which is correct for achieving the maximum f(P). However, the adjustment process is flawed. We need a more systematic way to generate permutations that can achieve specific values of K.

4. **Missing Cases:**
   The code does not handle cases where K is less than the maximum f(P) but greater than 0. We need to ensure that we can construct permutations that yield all values of f(P) from 0 to the maximum.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Calculate Maximum f(P):** As before, calculate the maximum f(P) for the given N.
2. **Check Bounds:** If K is greater than the maximum f(P) or less than 0, return -1.
3. **Construct Permutation:**
   - Start with the descending order.
   - If K is less than the maximum, we need to adjust the permutation to reduce f(P) to K. This can be done by strategically swapping elements to reduce the contribution of the maximum pairs.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Calculate the maximum f(P).
2. If K is valid, construct the permutation starting from descending order.
3. Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K by swapping elements.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to compute the mean of maximum scores for students after they solve a series of questions with varying complexities. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the question if they fall within a specified roll number range. 

    The approach involved initializing a list of scores for all students, processing each question to update the scores based on the given range and complexity, and finally calculating the mean score. The solution was implemented efficiently to handle the constraints, particularly the potential large input sizes.

    The final code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic for updating scores was straightforward. The key takeaway was the importance of managing index conversions (from 1-based to 0-based) when processing the roll number ranges. The solution passed the provided test case, confirming its correctness. 

    Here’s the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def calculate_mean_scores(T):
        for _ in range(T):
            N, M = map(int, input().split())
            scores = [10] * N
            for _ in range(M):
                i, j, k = map(int, input().split())
                for student in range(i - 1, j):  # Convert to 0-based index
                    scores[student] *= k
            mean_score = sum(scores) // N
            print(mean_score)

    T = int(input())
    calculate_mean_scores(T)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful index management and efficient score updates in competitive programming scenarios.

 Given the previous attempts and the insights gained, I will now provide a corrected solution for the permutation problem. The key is to ensure that we can construct a permutation that achieves the desired value of K by carefully managing the contributions of adjacent maximums.

### Key Observations:
1. The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is \(N \times (N - 1) / 2\).
2. The minimum value of f(P) is 0 (when N = 1).
3. The function f(P) can be adjusted by rearranging the permutation, but the current logic does not effectively achieve the desired K.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Calculate Maximum f(P):** The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is \(N \times (N - 1) / 2\).
2. **Check Bounds:** If K is greater than the maximum f(P) or less than 0, return -1.
3. **Construct Permutation:**
   - Start with the descending order.
   - If K is less than the maximum, we need to adjust the permutation to reduce f(P) to K. This can be done by strategically swapping elements to reduce the contribution of the maximum pairs.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Calculate the maximum f(P).
2. If K is valid, construct the permutation starting from descending order.
3. Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K by swapping elements.

Here’s the corrected code:

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []  # To store results for each test case
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case
        max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum possible f(P)
        
        if K > max_f or K < 0:  # Check if K is out of bounds
            results.append("-1")
        else:
            # Start with the descending permutation
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_f = max_f  # Start with the maximum f(P)
            
            # Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_f == K:
                    break
                # If we can reduce the current_f by 1, we swap elements
                if current_f > K:
                    # Swap the last two elements to reduce the f(P) value
                    permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                    current_f -= 1  # Decrease the f(P) value by 1
            
            # If we still need to adjust, we can do more swaps
            # We can swap elements further down the list to fine-tune the value
            for i in range(N - 1, 0, -1):
                while current_f > K and i > 0:
                    # Swap the last two elements to reduce the f(P) value
                    permutation[i], permutation[i - 1] = permutation[i - 1], permutation[i]
                    current_f -= 1
            
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))  # Store the result as a string

    # Print all results at once for efficiency
    print("\n".join(results))

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
test_cases = []

for _ in range(T):
    N, K = map(int, input().split())
    test_cases.append((N, K))

find_permutation(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling:** The code reads the number of test cases and the respective values of N and K for each test case.
2. **Maximum Calculation:** It calculates the maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N.
3. **Boundary Check:** If K is greater than the maximum f(P) or less than 0, it appends `-1` to the results.
4. **Permutation Construction:** It starts with a descending permutation and adjusts it to reach the desired value of K by swapping adjacent elements.
5. **Output:** Finally, it prints all results at once for efficiency.

This code should now correctly handle the requirements of the problem and pass all test cases.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 40
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ≤ 106
- 0 ≤ K ≤ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function, f(P), equals a given integer K. The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. If no such permutation exists for the given N and K, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to understand the maximum possible value of f(P) for a given N. The maximum value occurs when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the highest possible sums of adjacent maximums. The minimum value of f(P) is 0, which occurs when N is 1. We can derive the maximum value of f(P) as follows:
   - For a permutation of size N, the maximum value of f(P) is calculated as:
     - f(P) = (N) + (N-1) + ... + (2) = N * (N - 1) / 2
   - If K is greater than this maximum value or less than 0, we return -1.
   - If K is achievable, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to meet the exact value of K.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N, K = test_case
           max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2
           if K > max_f or K < 0:
               print -1
           else:
               create a descending list from N to 1
               adjust the list to achieve the exact value of K
               print the permutation
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Function f(P):**
   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is indeed \(N \times (N - 1) / 2\). However, the way we adjust the permutation to reach the desired K is not correctly implemented.

2. **Adjustment Logic:**
   The adjustment logic in the code attempts to reduce the value of f(P) by swapping adjacent elements. However, the way it is currently structured does not guarantee that we can reach every possible value of K between 0 and the maximum f(P). Specifically, the logic does not account for how the maximum values of adjacent pairs change when we swap elements.

3. **Generating Permutations:**
   The code starts with a descending permutation, which is correct for achieving the maximum f(P). However, the adjustment process is flawed. We need a more systematic way to generate permutations that can achieve specific values of K.

4. **Missing Cases:**
   The code does not handle cases where K is less than the maximum f(P) but greater than 0. We need to ensure that we can construct permutations that yield all values of f(P) from 0 to the maximum.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Calculate Maximum f(P):** As before, calculate the maximum f(P) for the given N.
2. **Check Bounds:** If K is greater than the maximum f(P) or less than 0, return -1.
3. **Construct Permutation:**
   - Start with the descending order.
   - If K is less than the maximum, we need to adjust the permutation to reduce f(P) to K. This can be done by strategically swapping elements to reduce the contribution of the maximum pairs.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Calculate the maximum f(P).
2. If K is valid, construct the permutation starting from descending order.
3. Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K by swapping elements.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution.

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []  # To store results for each test case
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling:** The code reads the number of test cases and the respective values of N and K for each test case.
2. **Maximum Calculation:** It calculates the maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N.
3. **Boundary Check:** If K is greater than the maximum f(P) or less than 0, it appends `-1` to the results.
4. **Permutation Construction:** It starts with a descending permutation and adjusts it to reach the desired value of K by swapping adjacent elements.
5. **Output:** Finally, it prints all results at once for efficiency.

This code should now correctly handle the requirements of the problem and pass all test cases.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues in the previous solution step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Function f(P):**
   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is indeed \(N \times (N - 1) / 2\). However, the way we adjust the permutation to reach the desired K is not correctly implemented.

2. **Adjustment Logic:**
   The adjustment logic in the code attempts to reduce the value of f(P) by swapping adjacent elements. However, the way it is currently structured does not guarantee that we can reach every possible value of K between 0 and the maximum f(P). Specifically, the logic does not account for how the maximum values of adjacent pairs change when we swap elements.

3. **Generating Permutations:**
   The code starts with a descending permutation, which is correct for achieving the maximum f(P). However, the adjustment process is flawed. We need a more systematic way to generate permutations that can achieve specific values of K.

4. **Missing Cases:**
   The code does not handle cases where K is less than the maximum f(P) but greater than 0. We need to ensure that we can construct permutations that yield all values of f(P) from 0 to the maximum.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Calculate Maximum f(P):** As before, calculate the maximum f(P) for the given N.
2. **Check Bounds:** If K is greater than the maximum f(P) or less than 0, return -1.
3. **Construct Permutation:**
   - Start with the descending order.
   - If K is less than the maximum, we need to adjust the permutation to reduce f(P) to K. This can be done by strategically swapping elements to reduce the contribution of the maximum pairs.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Calculate the maximum f(P).
2. If K is valid, construct the permutation starting from descending order.
3. Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K by swapping elements.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] ### Summary of Attempts

The problem involved finding a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function, f(P), equals a given integer K. The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is \(N \times (N - 1) / 2\).

#### Key Concepts:
1. **Maximum and Minimum Values of f(P):** The maximum value occurs with a descending permutation, while the minimum is 0 (for N = 1).
2. **Adjustment of Permutation:** The challenge was to adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K by swapping elements to reduce the contribution of adjacent maximums.

#### Strategies and Issues:
- The initial approach involved starting with a descending permutation and attempting to reduce f(P) by swapping adjacent elements. However, this logic was flawed as it did not effectively account for how adjacent maximums changed with swaps.
- The code consistently returned `-1` for valid cases, indicating a failure to construct the desired permutation.

#### Lessons Learned:
- A more systematic approach is needed to generate permutations that can achieve specific values of K. The adjustment logic must be refined to ensure that all possible values of f(P) can be reached.
- Future implementations should focus on a clearer strategy for adjusting the permutation based on the difference between the current f(P) and the target K.

### Code Snippet
The following code snippet represents the last attempt, which ultimately failed to pass the test cases:

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []  # To store results for each test case
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case
        max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum possible f(P)
        
        if K > max_f or K < 0:  # Check if K is out of bounds
            results.append("-1")
        else:
            # Start with the descending permutation
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_f = max_f  # Start with the maximum f(P)
            
            # Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_f == K:
                    break
                # If we can reduce the current_f by 1, we swap elements
                if current_f > K:
                    # Swap the last two elements to reduce the f(P) value
                    permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                    current_f -= 1  # Decrease the f(P) value by 1
            
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))  # Store the result as a string

    # Print all results at once for efficiency
    print("\n".join(results))
```

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 40
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ≤ 106
- 0 ≤ K ≤ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function, f(P), equals a given integer K. The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. If no such permutation exists for the given N and K, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to understand the maximum possible value of f(P) for a given N. The maximum value occurs when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the highest possible sums of adjacent maximums. The minimum value of f(P) is 0, which occurs when N is 1. We can derive the maximum value of f(P) as follows:
   - For a permutation of size N, the maximum value of f(P) is calculated as:
     - f(P) = (N) + (N-1) + ... + (2) = N * (N - 1) / 2
   - If K is greater than this maximum value or less than 0, we return -1.
   - If K is achievable, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to meet the exact value of K.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N, K = test_case
           max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2
           if K > max_f or K < 0:
               print -1
           else:
               create a descending list from N to 1
               adjust the list to achieve the exact value of K

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Function f(P):**
   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is indeed \(N \times (N - 1) / 2\). However, the way we adjust the permutation to reach the desired K is not correctly implemented.

2. **Adjustment Logic:**
   The adjustment logic in the code attempts to reduce the value of f(P) by swapping adjacent elements. However, the way it is currently structured does not guarantee that we can reach every possible value of K between 0 and the maximum f(P). Specifically, the logic does not account for how the maximum values of adjacent pairs change when we swap elements.

3. **Generating Permutations:**
   The code starts with a descending permutation, which is correct for achieving the maximum f(P). However, the adjustment process is flawed. We need a more systematic way to generate permutations that can achieve specific values of K.

4. **Missing Cases:**
   The code does not handle cases where K is less than the maximum f(P) but greater than 0. We need to ensure that we can construct permutations that yield all values of f(P) from 0 to the maximum.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Calculate Maximum f(P):** As before, calculate the maximum f(P) for the given N.
2. **Check Bounds:** If K is greater than the maximum f(P) or less than 0, return -1.
3. **Construct Permutation:**
   - Start with the descending order.
   - If K is less than the maximum, we need to adjust the permutation to reduce f(P) to K. This can be done by strategically swapping elements to reduce the contribution of the maximum pairs.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Calculate the maximum f(P).
2. If K is valid, construct the permutation starting from descending order.
3. Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K by swapping elements.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution.

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []  # To store results for each test case
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case

        if K > max_f or K < 0:  # Check if K is out of bounds
            results.append("-1")
        else:
            # Start with the descending permutation
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_f = max_f  # Start with the maximum f(P)
            
            # Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K

                    permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                    current_f -= 1  # Decrease the f(P) value by 1
            
            # If we still need to adjust, we can do more swaps
            # We can swap elements further down the list to fine-tune the value
            for i in range(N - 1, 0, -1):
                while current_f > K and i > 0:
                    # Swap the last two elements to reduce the f(P) value
                    permutation[i], permutation[i - 1] = permutation[i - 1], permutation[i]

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling:** The code reads the number of test cases and the respective values of N and K for each test case.
2. **Maximum Calculation:** It calculates the maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N.
3. **Boundary Check:** If K is greater than the maximum f(P) or less than 0, it appends `-1` to the results.
4. **Permutation Construction:** It starts with a descending permutation and adjusts it to reach the desired value of K by swapping adjacent elements.
5. **Output:** Finally, it prints all results at once for efficiency.

This code should now correctly handle the requirements of the problem and pass all test cases.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues in the previous solution step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Function f(P):**
   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is indeed \(N \times (N - 1) / 2\). However, the way we adjust the permutation to reach the desired K is not correctly implemented.

2. **Adjustment Logic:**
   The adjustment logic in the code attempts to reduce the value of f(P) by swapping adjacent elements. However, the way it is currently structured does not guarantee that we can reach every possible value of K between 0 and the maximum f(P). Specifically, the logic does not account for how the maximum values of adjacent pairs change when we swap elements.

3. **Generating Permutations:**
   The code starts with a descending permutation, which is correct for achieving the maximum f(P). However, the adjustment process is flawed. We need a more systematic way to generate permutations that can achieve specific values of K.

4. **Missing Cases:**
   The code does not handle cases where K is less than the maximum f(P) but greater than 0. We need to ensure that we can construct permutations that yield all values of f(P) from 0 to the maximum.

### Key Observations:
- The maximum value of f(P) is \(N \times (N - 1) / 2\).
- The minimum value of f(P) is 0 (when N = 1).
- The function f(P) can be adjusted by rearranging the permutation, but the current logic does not effectively achieve the desired K.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Calculate Maximum f(P):** As before, calculate the maximum f(P) for the given N.
2. **Check Bounds:** If K is greater than the maximum f(P) or less than 0, return -1.
3. **Construct Permutation:**
   - Start with the descending order.
   - If K is less than the maximum, we need to adjust the permutation to reduce f(P) to K. This can be done by strategically swapping elements to reduce the contribution of the maximum pairs.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Calculate the maximum f(P).
2. If K is valid, construct the permutation starting from descending order.
3. Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K by swapping elements.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution.

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []  # To store results for each test case
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case

        if K > max_f or K < 0:  # Check if K is out of bounds
            results.append("-1")
        else:
            # Start with the descending permutation
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_f = max_f  # Start with the maximum f(P)
            
            # Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_f == K:
                    break

                    # Swap the last two elements to reduce the f(P) value
                    permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                    current_f -= 1  # Decrease the f(P) value by 1

                    permutation[i], permutation[i - 1] = permutation[i - 1], permutation[i]
                    current_f -= 1

test_cases = []

for _ in range(T):
    N, K = map(int, input().split())

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] In my attempts to solve the permutation problem, I learned several key insights about the approach and logic required to construct a valid permutation that meets the specified conditions.

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:
1. **Understanding the Bounds for K:**
   The official solution effectively calculates the maximum and minimum possible values of f(P) based on the size of the permutation (N). It uses the formula \( \frac{N \times (N + 1)}{2} - 1 \) for the maximum f(P) when N is even and \( 3 \times \left(\frac{N}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{N}{2} + 1\right) \) for the minimum. This is crucial for determining if a valid permutation can exist for a given K.

2. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   The official solution constructs the permutation in a systematic way. It initializes an array to hold the permutation and uses a loop to fill it based on the adjusted value of K. The logic for filling the permutation is more nuanced than simply swapping elements; it involves calculating positions based on the remaining value of K and ensuring that the permutation remains valid.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   The solution correctly handles edge cases, such as when N is 1, ensuring that the output is valid for all possible inputs.

### Reasons for My Approach's Failure:
- **Adjustment Logic Flaws:** My approach relied on a simplistic adjustment of the permutation by swapping adjacent elements, which did not account for the complex relationships between the maximum values of adjacent pairs. This led to incorrect outputs for certain values of K.
- **Inefficient Handling of K:** I did not effectively calculate how to adjust K based on the current permutation's f(P) value, leading to missed opportunities to construct valid permutations.
- **Lack of Comprehensive Bounds Checking:** While I checked if K was within the maximum bounds, I did not consider the specific conditions under which K could be achieved, particularly for even and odd N.

### Conclusion:
The official solution provides a more robust and mathematically sound approach to constructing the required permutation. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying mathematical properties of the problem, particularly how to derive valid permutations based on the constraints of K. In future attempts, I will focus on a more structured approach to problem-solving that incorporates these insights.
