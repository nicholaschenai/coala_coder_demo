## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Golomb sequence $G_1, G_2, \ldots$ is a non-decreasing integer sequence such that for each positive integer $n$, $G_n$ is the number of occurrences of $n$ in this sequence. The first few elements of $G$ are $[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, \ldots]$. Do you know the recurrence relation for the Golomb sequence? It is $G_1 = 1$ and $G_{n+1} = 1+G_{n+1-G_{G_n}}$ for each $n \ge 1$. A self-describing sequence, isn't it?
Mr. Strange wants to learn CP, so he asked Chef, who is one of the best competitive programmers in the world, to teach him. Chef decided to test his ability by giving him the following task.
Find the sum of squares of the $L$-th through $R$-th term of the Golomb sequence, i.e. $S = \sum_{i=L}^R G_i^2$. Since the sum can be quite large, compute it modulo $10^9+7$.
Can you help Mr. Strange carry out this task given to him by his teacher?

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer $S$ modulo $10^9+7$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le L \le R \le 10^{10}$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (50 points):
- $T \le 10^2$
- $R \le 10^9$
Subtask #2 (50 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----
3
1 5
2 4
100 100

-----Example Output-----
27

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: $1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 = 27$
Example case 2: $2^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 17$
Example case 3: $21^2 = 441$

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

INFO - [Task id] 911 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to compute the sum of the squares of specific terms in the Golomb sequence for multiple test cases. The Golomb sequence is defined such that each term counts how many times its index appears in the sequence. Given two indices L and R for each test case, we need to find the sum of the squares of the terms from the L-th to the R-th term in the sequence, and return this sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to efficiently compute the Golomb sequence values for very large indices (up to \(10^{10}\)). Instead of generating the entire sequence up to R, we can use the recurrence relation of the Golomb sequence to compute the values on-the-fly. We will also need to keep track of the sum of squares as we compute the terms. Given the constraints, we should aim for a solution that avoids excessive computation and memory usage.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function golomb(n):
       if n is in memo:
           return memo[n]
       if n == 1:
           return 1
       else:
           result = 1 + golomb(n - golomb(golomb(n - 1)))
           memo[n] = result

       for i from L to R:
           g_i = golomb(i)

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series defined as 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, etc. Initially, I misidentified the formula for generating the series, which led to incorrect outputs. The series is generated by the sum of the first (N-1) perfect squares, which can be calculated using the formula:

    \[ T(N) = \frac{(N-1) \cdot N \cdot (2(N-1) + 1)}{6} \]

    This formula derives from the known formula for the sum of the first k squares.

    The initial approach incorrectly used a different formula, resulting in outputs that did not match the expected results. After analyzing the series and identifying the correct pattern, I revised the code to implement the correct formula, which successfully passed all test cases.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def find_nth_number(N):
        if N == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            return ((N - 1) * N * (2 * (N - 1) + 1)) // 6

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        result = find_nth_number(N)
        print(result)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and ensuring the correct mathematical formulas are applied.

INFO - [Task id] 911 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to compute the sum of the squares of specific terms in the Golomb sequence for multiple test cases. The Golomb sequence is defined such that each term counts how many times its index appears in the sequence. Given two indices L and R, we need to find the sum of the squares of the terms from the L-th to the R-th term in the sequence, and return this sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to efficiently compute the Golomb sequence values for very large indices (up to \(10^{10}\)). Instead of generating the entire sequence up to R, we can use the recurrence relation of the Golomb sequence to compute the required terms on-the-fly. We will also need to keep track of the sum of squares as we compute these terms. Given the constraints, we should ensure our solution is efficient enough to handle up to \(10^5\) test cases.

INFO - [Task id] 911 [generation text] In this task, I was required to compute the sum of squares of specific terms in the Golomb sequence for multiple test cases. The Golomb sequence is defined recursively, which posed a challenge due to the potential size of the indices (up to \(10^{10}\)). The key insight was to use memoization to efficiently compute the Golomb values without recalculating them multiple times.

The approach involved defining a `golomb` function that uses a dictionary to store previously computed values, thus avoiding redundant calculations. The `sum_of_squares` function iterated through the specified range, calculating the Golomb values and their squares, while maintaining a running total modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow.

The final implementation successfully handled the provided test cases, demonstrating that memoization effectively optimized the recursive computation of the Golomb sequence. However, the solution may still struggle with the upper limits of the constraints due to the inherent inefficiency of calculating each term individually for very large ranges. Future improvements could involve a more direct mathematical approach to derive the sum of squares over ranges without explicit iteration. 

Hereâ€™s the core code snippet for reference:

```python
memo = {}

def golomb(n):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        result = 1 + golomb(n - golomb(golomb(n - 1)))
        memo[n] = result
        return result

def sum_of_squares(L, R):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(L, R + 1):
        g_i = golomb(i)
        sum += g_i * g_i
        sum = sum % (10**9 + 7)
    return sum
``` 

This experience reinforced the importance of memoization in recursive problems and highlighted the need for efficiency when dealing with large input sizes.

INFO - [Task id] 911 [generation text] The official solution employs a more efficient approach to compute the sum of squares of the Golomb sequence over a range, leveraging precomputation and binary search techniques. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Precomputation of the Golomb Sequence:**
   - The solution precomputes the Golomb sequence values up to a certain limit (in this case, \(10^6 + 100\)). This allows for quick access to the values without recalculating them for each query.
   - It uses a dynamic programming array `dp` to store the Golomb values, where `dp[i]` is computed using the recurrence relation.

2. **Prefix Sums for Efficient Querying:**
   - The solution maintains a `prefix_storer` array that stores cumulative sums of the squares of the Golomb values. This allows for quick calculation of the sum of squares over any range [L, R] by simply subtracting two prefix sums.
   - The `bin_storer` array is used to keep track of the cumulative counts of the Golomb values, which aids in determining the upper bounds for binary search.

3. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Queries:**
   - The `find_upper_bound` function implements a binary search to find the appropriate index in the `bin_storer` array for a given value. This is crucial for efficiently determining how many terms fall within a certain range.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - The `fire_query` function computes the result for each query by leveraging the precomputed prefix sums and the binary search results, ensuring that the solution runs efficiently even for large inputs.

Overall, the official solution is significantly more efficient than the initial approach, which attempted to compute the Golomb sequence values on-the-fly for each query. The use of precomputation and binary search allows it to handle the constraints of the problem effectively, making it suitable for the upper limits of the input sizes. 

In future implementations, focusing on precomputation and efficient data structures for range queries can greatly enhance performance, especially in competitive programming scenarios.
