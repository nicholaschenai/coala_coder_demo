    "summary": "In this task, I was required to compute the sum of squares of specific terms in the Golomb sequence for multiple test cases. The Golomb sequence is defined recursively, which posed a challenge due to the potential size of the indices (up to \\(10^{10}\\)). The key insight was to use memoization to efficiently compute the Golomb values without recalculating them multiple times.\n\nThe approach involved defining a `golomb` function that uses a dictionary to store previously computed values, thus avoiding redundant calculations. The `sum_of_squares` function iterated through the specified range, calculating the Golomb values and their squares, while maintaining a running total modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to prevent overflow.\n\nThe final implementation successfully handled the provided test cases, demonstrating that memoization effectively optimized the recursive computation of the Golomb sequence. However, the solution may still struggle with the upper limits of the constraints due to the inherent inefficiency of calculating each term individually for very large ranges. Future improvements could involve a more direct mathematical approach to derive the sum of squares over ranges without explicit iteration. \n\nHere\u2019s the core code snippet for reference:\n\n```python\nmemo = {}\n\ndef golomb(n):\n    if n in memo:\n        return memo[n]\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        result = 1 + golomb(n - golomb(golomb(n - 1)))\n        memo[n] = result\n        return result\n\ndef sum_of_squares(L, R):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(L, R + 1):\n        g_i = golomb(i)\n        sum += g_i * g_i\n        sum = sum % (10**9 + 7)\n    return sum\n``` \n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of memoization in recursive problems and highlighted the need for efficiency when dealing with large input sizes.",
    "reflection": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach to compute the sum of squares of the Golomb sequence over a range, leveraging precomputation and binary search techniques. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Precomputation of the Golomb Sequence:**\n   - The solution precomputes the Golomb sequence values up to a certain limit (in this case, \\(10^6 + 100\\)). This allows for quick access to the values without recalculating them for each query.\n   - It uses a dynamic programming array `dp` to store the Golomb values, where `dp[i]` is computed using the recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Prefix Sums for Efficient Querying:**\n   - The solution maintains a `prefix_storer` array that stores cumulative sums of the squares of the Golomb values. This allows for quick calculation of the sum of squares over any range [L, R] by simply subtracting two prefix sums.\n   - The `bin_storer` array is used to keep track of the cumulative counts of the Golomb values, which aids in determining the upper bounds for binary search.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Queries:**\n   - The `find_upper_bound` function implements a binary search to find the appropriate index in the `bin_storer` array for a given value. This is crucial for efficiently determining how many terms fall within a certain range.\n\n4. **Query Handling:**\n   - The `fire_query` function computes the result for each query by leveraging the precomputed prefix sums and the binary search results, ensuring that the solution runs efficiently even for large inputs.\n\nOverall, the official solution is significantly more efficient than the initial approach, which attempted to compute the Golomb sequence values on-the-fly for each query. The use of precomputation and binary search allows it to handle the constraints of the problem effectively, making it suitable for the upper limits of the input sizes. \n\nIn future implementations, focusing on precomputation and efficient data structures for range queries can greatly enhance performance, especially in competitive programming scenarios.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: sum_of_squares]\nThis function calculates the sum of the squares of the Golomb sequence values for a given range from L to R. It initializes a sum variable to zero and iterates through each integer in the specified range. For each integer, it computes the corresponding Golomb sequence value and adds its square to the sum. To prevent overflow, the sum is taken modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) at each step. Finally, it returns the computed sum.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios involving competitive programming, particularly when dealing with sequences and mathematical computations. Understanding the Golomb sequence and its properties can help in solving problems that require efficient calculations of sequence values over large ranges, especially when the constraints are high, such as in this problem where L and R can go up to 10^10. It also highlights the importance of memoization in optimizing recursive functions to handle large inputs effectively. Additionally, this knowledge can be applied in algorithm design, particularly in dynamic programming and combinatorial problems."
