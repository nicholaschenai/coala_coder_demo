The first few elements of $G$ are $[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, \\ldots]$. Do you know the recurrence relation for the Golomb sequence? It is $G_1 = 1$ and $G_{n+1} = 1+G_{n+1-G_{G_n}}$ for each $n \\ge 1$. A self-describing sequence, isn't it?\nMr. Strange wants to learn CP, so he asked Chef, who is one of the best competitive programmers in the world, to teach him. Chef decided to test his ability by giving him the following task.\nFind the sum of squares of the $L$-th through $R$-th term of the Golomb sequence, i.e. $S = \\sum_{i=L}^R G_i^2$. Since the sum can be quite large, compute it modulo $10^9+7$.\nCan you help Mr. Strange carry out this task given to him by his teacher?\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.

The Golomb sequence is defined recursively, which posed a challenge due to the potential size of the indices (up to \\(10^{10}\\)). The key insight was to use memoization to efficiently compute the Golomb values without recalculating them multiple times.\n\nThe approach involved defining a `golomb` function that uses a dictionary to store previously computed values, thus avoiding redundant calculations. The `sum_of_squares` function iterated through the specified range, calculating the Golomb values and their squares, while maintaining a running total modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to prevent overflow.\n\nThe final implementation successfully handled the provided test cases, demonstrating that memoization effectively optimized the recursive computation of the Golomb sequence.

        "content": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach to compute the sum of squares of the Golomb sequence over a range, leveraging precomputation and binary search techniques. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Precomputation of the Golomb Sequence:**\n   - The solution precomputes the Golomb sequence values up to a certain limit (in this case, \\(10^6 + 100\\)). This allows for quick access to the values without recalculating them for each query.\n   - It uses a dynamic programming array `dp` to store the Golomb values, where `dp[i]` is computed using the recurrence relation.\n\n2. **Prefix Sums for Efficient Querying:**\n   - The solution maintains a `prefix_storer` array that stores cumulative sums of the squares of the Golomb values. This allows for quick calculation of the sum of squares over any range [L, R] by simply subtracting two prefix sums.\n   - The `bin_storer` array is used to keep track of the cumulative counts of the Golomb values, which aids in determining the upper bounds for binary search.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Queries:**\n   - The `find_upper_bound` function implements a binary search to find the appropriate index in the `bin_storer` array for a given value. This is crucial for efficiently determining how many terms fall within a certain range.\n\n4. **Query Handling:**\n   - The `fire_query` function computes the result for each query by leveraging the precomputed prefix sums and the binary search results, ensuring that the solution runs efficiently even for large inputs.\n\nOverall, the official solution is significantly more efficient than the initial approach, which attempted to compute the Golomb sequence values on-the-fly for each query. The use of precomputation and binary search allows it to handle the constraints of the problem effectively, making it suitable for the upper limits of the input sizes. \n\nIn future implementations, focusing on precomputation and efficient data structures for range queries can greatly enhance performance, especially in competitive programming scenarios."
