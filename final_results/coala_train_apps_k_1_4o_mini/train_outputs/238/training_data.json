    "summary": "In this task, I was required to find the maximum profit from stock prices given over a series of days, allowing for at most two transactions. The core concept involved using a dynamic programming approach to track profits after each transaction while maintaining the minimum prices for buying.\n\nThe solution involved initializing variables to keep track of the minimum prices for the first and second transactions and the corresponding maximum profits. As I iterated through the prices, I updated these variables based on the current price, ensuring that I calculated the potential profits correctly.\n\nThe final implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases. The key takeaway was the importance of maintaining state across multiple transactions and efficiently updating the minimum prices and maximum profits in a single pass through the data. This approach proved effective and optimal for the problem at hand.\n\nHere is the final code snippet for reference:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maxProfit(self, prices: list[int]) -> int:\n        first_buy = float('inf')\n        first_profit = 0\n        second_buy = float('inf')\n        second_profit = 0\n        \n        for price in prices:\n            first_buy = min(first_buy, price)\n            first_profit = max(first_profit, price - first_buy)\n            second_buy = min(second_buy, price - first_profit)\n            second_profit = max(second_profit, price - second_buy)\n        \n        return second_profit\n``` \n\nThis solution effectively captures the necessary logic to solve the problem while adhering to the constraints provided.",
    "reflection": "The official solution employs a two-pass approach to efficiently calculate the maximum profit from at most two transactions. The key insights from this solution are as follows:\n\n1. **Reverse Pass for Right Maximum Profits**: The first loop iterates backward through the prices to calculate the maximum profit that can be achieved from selling on any given day. It maintains an array `rmax_profits` where each entry at index `i` represents the maximum profit obtainable from day `i` to the end of the list. This is done by keeping track of the maximum price seen so far (`rmax`) and updating the potential profit for each day.\n\n2. **Forward Pass for Left Maximum Profits**: The second loop iterates forward through the prices to calculate the maximum profit that can be achieved from buying on any given day. It keeps track of the minimum price seen so far (`lmin`) and the maximum profit from the first transaction (`lmax_profit`). For each day, it combines the profit from the first transaction with the precomputed profits from the second transaction (using `rmax_profits`).\n\n3. **Combining Profits**: The total profit is calculated by adding the profits from the first and second transactions. The solution ensures that it only considers valid transactions and updates the maximum total profit (`tmax_profit`) accordingly.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: The solution also handles edge cases where no profit can be made by returning 0 if the maximum profit is negative.\n\nOverall, the official solution is efficient in both time and space complexity, leveraging dynamic programming principles to break down the problem into manageable parts. My initial approach was similar in concept but could have been optimized further by explicitly separating the two transaction calculations and ensuring clarity in the profit accumulation process. The official solution's use of two separate passes (one backward and one forward) provides a clearer structure and avoids potential pitfalls in tracking multiple states simultaneously.",
    "desc": "\n[description]\nThis function calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved from at most two transactions of buying and selling stocks, given a list of stock prices. It initializes variables to track the minimum prices for the first and second buys, as well as the maximum profits after each transaction. As it iterates through the list of prices, it updates these variables based on the current price. The first buy price is updated to the lowest price encountered, while the first profit is calculated based on the difference between the current price and the first buy price. Similarly, it updates the second buy price and the second profit based on the profits from the first transaction. Finally, it returns the maximum profit achievable after the second transaction.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where investors want to maximize their profits from stock trading with limited transactions. It can be applied in algorithmic trading, financial analysis, and investment strategy development. Understanding how to optimize profits with constraints on the number of transactions can help traders make informed decisions in volatile markets. Additionally, this algorithm can be adapted for similar problems in other domains, such as maximizing profits in sales with limited resources or managing inventory with constraints."
