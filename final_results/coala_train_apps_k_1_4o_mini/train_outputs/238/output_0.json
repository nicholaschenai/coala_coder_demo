    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to determine the maximum profit that can be made from buying and selling a stock, given the prices of the stock over a series of days. You are allowed to make at most two transactions, meaning you can buy and sell the stock twice, but you must sell the stock before you can buy it again.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will keep track of the maximum profit that can be achieved with up to two transactions. We can maintain two arrays (or variables) to store the maximum profit after the first and second transactions. For each day, we will calculate the maximum profit we can achieve by either not trading or by selling on that day after having bought on a previous day.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Initialize two variables to track the maximum profit after the first and second transactions\n   Initialize two variables to track the minimum price seen so far for the first and second transactions\n   For each price in the prices array:\n       Update the first transaction profit based on the current price and the minimum price seen so far\n       Update the second transaction profit based on the current price and the profit from the first transaction\n       Update the minimum prices for the first and second transactions\n   Return the maximum profit from the second transaction\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maxProfit(self, prices: list[int]) -> int:\n        # Initialize variables to track the maximum profit for two transactions\n        first_buy = float('inf')  # Minimum price for the first buy\n        first_profit = 0           # Maximum profit after the first transaction\n        second_buy = float('inf')  # Minimum price for the second buy\n        second_profit = 0          # Maximum profit after the second transaction\n        \n        # Iterate through each price in the prices list\n        for price in prices:\n            # Update the minimum price for the first buy\n            first_buy = min(first_buy, price)\n            # Update the maximum profit after the first transaction\n            first_profit = max(first_profit, price - first_buy)\n            # Update the minimum price for the second buy\n            second_buy = min(second_buy, price - first_profit)\n            # Update the maximum profit after the second transaction\n            second_profit = max(second_profit, price - second_buy)\n        \n        # Return the maximum profit after the second transaction\n        return second_profit\n```",
