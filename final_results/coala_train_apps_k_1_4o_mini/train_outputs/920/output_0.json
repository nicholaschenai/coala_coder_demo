    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We have a line of students represented by a string where 'b' stands for boys and 'g' stands for girls. We want to rearrange the students in such a way that the \"awkwardness\" (which is defined as the sum of distances between each boy and girl) is minimized. The goal is to find the minimum awkwardness possible after rearranging the students.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To minimize awkwardness, we should group all boys together and all girls together. This is because the distance between boys and girls will be minimized when they are adjacent to each other. The awkwardness can be calculated by counting the number of boys and girls and using their positions in the line. The formula for awkwardness can be derived from the number of boys and girls and their respective positions.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s):\n       count_b = count of 'b' in s\n       count_g = count of 'g' in s\n       total_awkwardness = 0\n       \n       # Calculate the awkwardness based on the positions\n       for i from 0 to count_b - 1:\n           total_awkwardness += count_g * (i + 1)\n       \n       for j from 0 to count_g - 1:\n           total_awkwardness += count_b * (j + 1)\n       \n       return total_awkwardness\n\n   function main():\n       read T\n       for each test case:\n           read s\n           result = calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s)\n           print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s):\n    # Count the number of boys and girls\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_g = s.count('g')\n    total_awkwardness = 0\n    \n    # Calculate the awkwardness based on the positions of boys\n    for i in range(count_b):\n        total_awkwardness += count_g * (i + 1)\n    \n    # Calculate the awkwardness based on the positions of girls\n    for j in range(count_g):\n        total_awkwardness += count_b * (j + 1)\n    \n    return total_awkwardness\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        # Read the string for each test case\n        s = input().strip()\n        # Calculate the minimum awkwardness\n        result = calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s)\n        # Print the result\n        print(result)\n\nmain()\n```",
