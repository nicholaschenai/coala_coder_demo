## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The chef was playing with numbers and he found that natural number N can be obtained by sum various unique natural numbers, For challenging himself chef wrote one problem statement, which he decided to solve in future.
Problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
After that Cheffina came and read what chef wrote in the problem statement, for having some fun Cheffina made some changes in the problem statement as.
New problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of unique +ve integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
But, the chef is now confused, how to solve a new problem statement, help the chef to solve this new problem statement.

-----Input:-----

- Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers $N, K$. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line answer to the problem statement.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$

-----EXPLANATION:-----
For 1) 4 can be obtained by as [ 4^1 ], [1^1, 3^1], [2^1, 2^1]. (here ^ stands for power)
But here [2^1, 2^1] is not the valid way because it is not made up of unique +ve integers. 
For 2) 38 can be obtained in the way which is [2^2, 3^2, 5^2] = 4 + 9 + 25

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem requires us to find the number of unique ways to express a natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of \( K \). Each test case provides values for \( N \) and \( K \), and we need to compute the number of valid combinations for each case.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with backtracking. We will:
   - Generate all possible unique integers whose \( K \)-th powers do not exceed \( N \).
   - Use a recursive function to explore combinations of these integers, checking if their \( K \)-th powers can sum up to \( N \).
   - Keep track of the current sum and the integers used to ensure they are unique.
   - Count the valid combinations that sum to \( N \).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function countWays(N, K):
       initialize a list to store unique integers whose K-th power is <= N
       for i from 1 to the maximum integer such that i^K <= N:
           add i to the list
       
       define a recursive function backtrack(current_sum, start_index):
           if current_sum == N:
               return 1  // found a valid combination
           if current_sum > N:
               return 0  // exceeded the target
           
           count = 0
           for i from start_index to the length of the list:
               count += backtrack(current_sum + list[i]^K, i + 1)  // move to the next integer
           return count
       
       return backtrack(0, 0)  // start with sum 0 and first index

   read T
   for each test case:
       read N, K
       print countWays(N, K)
   ```

def countWays(N, K):
    # Generate a list of unique integers whose K-th power is <= N
    unique_numbers = []
    i = 1
    while i ** K <= N:

        i += 1

    # Recursive function to count the ways to sum to N using unique integers

        -----Explanation:-----
        For N=3

        total subsets are:

        {1}

        {2}

        {3}

        {1,2}

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
           We need to find the number of subsets from the set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} such that a specific number I appears at the K-th position in the sorted order of the subset. The output should be the count of such subsets for multiple queries, and since the result can be large, we need to return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
           To solve this problem, we need to consider how subsets are formed and how to determine the position of a specific number within those subsets. The key steps are:
           - For a number I to be at position K in a subset, there must be exactly K-1 numbers less than I in the subset.
           - The remaining numbers can be any of the numbers greater than I.
           - We can use combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of ways to choose K-1 numbers from the numbers less than I and any number of numbers from those greater than I.
           - We will precompute factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently calculate combinations.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
           ```
           function calculate_subsets(N, queries):
               MOD = 10**9 + 7
               precompute factorials and inverses up to N
       
               for each query (I, K):
                   if K > I or K < 1:
                       output 0
                   else:
                       count_less_than_I = I - 1
                       count_greater_than_I = N - I
                       ways_to_choose = comb(count_less_than_I, K - 1)
                       total_subsets = 2 ** count_greater_than_I

   We need to find the number of ways to express a natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of \( K \). Each way of expressing \( N \) must use different integers, and we need to count all such unique combinations.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with memoization (or dynamic programming). The idea is to explore all combinations of unique integers whose \( K \)-th powers can sum up to \( N \). We will:
   - Start from the largest integer whose \( K \)-th power is less than or equal to \( N \).
   - For each integer, decide whether to include it in the sum or not.
   - If included, subtract its \( K \)-th power from \( N \) and continue the process with the next smaller integer.
   - Use memoization to store results for specific \( N \) and the current integer to avoid redundant calculations.

Problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
After that Cheffina came and read what chef wrote in the problem statement, for having some fun Cheffina made some changes in the problem statement as.
New problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of unique +ve integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?

- $1 \leq K \leq 6$

-----Sample Input:-----

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] The problem involved finding the number of ways to express a natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of \( K \). The solution required a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently explore all combinations of integers.

Key concepts included:
- **Recursive Backtracking**: The solution recursively included or excluded integers while checking if their \( K \)-th powers could sum to \( N \).
- **Memoization**: To avoid redundant calculations, results for specific combinations of \( N \) and the current integer were stored.

The implementation involved defining a recursive function `countWays` that handled the logic of including or excluding integers, and a `solve` function to determine the maximum integer to consider based on \( N \) and \( K \).

The final code snippet effectively solved the problem and passed the provided test cases. The approach was efficient given the constraints, and no unexpected errors were encountered during implementation. 

Here’s the core code for future reference:

```python
def countWays(N, K, current, memo):
    if (N, current) in memo:
        return memo[(N, current)]
    
    if N == 0:
        return 1
    if N < 0 or current <= 0:
        return 0

    include_current = countWays(N - current**K, K, current - 1, memo)
    exclude_current = countWays(N, K, current - 1, memo)

    memo[(N, current)] = include_current + exclude_current
    return memo[(N, current)]

def solve(N, K):
    current = 1
    while current**K <= N:
        current += 1
    current -= 1

    memo = {}
    return countWays(N, K, current, memo)

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    N, K = map(int, input().split())
    result = solve(N, K)
    print(result)
``` 

This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process and the strategies employed, which can be useful for similar future problems involving combinations and recursive solutions.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions

- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:

    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution

    x,n = map(int,input().split())
    reach = [0]*(x+1)
    reach[0] = 1
    i=1
    while i**n<=x:
        j = 1
        while j+i**n<=x:
            j+=1
        j-=1
        while j>=0:
            if reach[j]>0:
                reach[j+i**n]+=reach[j]
            j-=1
        i+=1
    #print(reach)
    print(reach[-1])

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] The official solution employs a dynamic programming approach to efficiently count the number of ways to express a number \( N \) as the sum of unique integers raised to the power \( K \). Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The solution uses an array `reach` where `reach[i]` represents the number of ways to sum up to \( i \) using unique integers raised to the power \( n \). This is initialized with `reach[0] = 1`, indicating that there is one way to achieve a sum of zero (by using no numbers).

2. **Iterating Over Powers**: The outer loop iterates over integers \( i \) starting from 1, calculating \( i^n \) until it exceeds \( x \). This ensures that only valid powers are considered.

3. **Updating the Reach Array**: For each valid power \( i^n \), the inner loop updates the `reach` array in reverse order. This prevents overwriting values that are still needed for the current iteration. The inner loop checks all sums that can be formed by adding \( i^n \) to previously computed sums.

4. **Final Output**: After processing all integers, the final result is found in `reach[x]`, which gives the total number of ways to express \( x \) as the sum of unique integers raised to the power \( n \).

### Key Takeaways:
- The use of a dynamic programming array allows for efficient counting of combinations without redundant calculations.
- The reverse iteration when updating the `reach` array is crucial to maintain the integrity of the counts for each unique integer.
- This approach is more efficient than a recursive solution with memoization, especially for larger values of \( N \) and \( K \), as it avoids the overhead of recursive calls.

In summary, the official solution effectively combines dynamic programming principles with careful iteration to solve the problem efficiently, which is a valuable technique to remember for similar combinatorial problems in the future.

[Problem]
    The chef was playing with numbers and he found that natural number N can be obtained by sum various unique natural numbers, For challenging himself chef wrote one problem statement, which he decided to solve in future.
    Problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
    After that Cheffina came and read what chef wrote in the problem statement, for having some fun Cheffina made some changes in the problem statement as.
    New problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of unique +ve integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
    But, the chef is now confused, how to solve a new problem statement, help the chef to solve this new problem statement.

    -----Input:-----
    - First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
    - Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers $N, K$. 

    -----Output:-----
    For each test case, output in a single line answer to the problem statement.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 10$
    - $1 \leq N \leq 1000$
    - $1 \leq K \leq 6$

    -----Sample Input:-----
    2
    4 1
    38 2

    -----Sample Output:-----
    2
    1

    -----EXPLANATION:-----
    For 1) 4 can be obtained by as [ 4^1 ], [1^1, 3^1], [2^1, 2^1]. (here ^ stands for power)
    But here [2^1, 2^1] is not the valid way because it is not made up of unique +ve integers. 
    For 2) 38 can be obtained in the way which is [2^2, 3^2, 5^2] = 4 + 9 + 25

    def countWays(N, K, current, memo):
        # Check if the result is already computed
        if (N, current) in memo:
            return memo[(N, current)]
    
        if N == 0:
            return 1  # Found a valid combination
        if N < 0 or current <= 0:
            return 0  # Invalid combination

        # Count ways including the current number and excluding it
        include_current = countWays(N - current**K, K, current - 1, memo)
        exclude_current = countWays(N, K, current - 1, memo)

        # Store the result in memo
        memo[(N, current)] = include_current + exclude_current
        return memo[(N, current)]

    def solve(N, K):
        # Find the largest integer such that current^K <= N
        current = 1
        while current**K <= N:
            current += 1
        current -= 1  # Step back to the last valid integer

        memo = {}
        return countWays(N, K, current, memo)

    # Read number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        result = solve(N, K)
        print(result)
