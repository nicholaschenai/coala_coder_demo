    "summary": "The problem involved finding the number of ways to express a natural number \\( N \\) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of \\( K \\). The solution required a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently explore all combinations of integers.\n\nKey concepts included:\n- **Recursive Backtracking**: The solution recursively included or excluded integers while checking if their \\( K \\)-th powers could sum to \\( N \\).\n- **Memoization**: To avoid redundant calculations, results for specific combinations of \\( N \\) and the current integer were stored.\n\nThe implementation involved defining a recursive function `countWays` that handled the logic of including or excluding integers, and a `solve` function to determine the maximum integer to consider based on \\( N \\) and \\( K \\).\n\nThe final code snippet effectively solved the problem and passed the provided test cases. The approach was efficient given the constraints, and no unexpected errors were encountered during implementation. \n\nHere\u2019s the core code for future reference:\n\n```python\ndef countWays(N, K, current, memo):\n    if (N, current) in memo:\n        return memo[(N, current)]\n    \n    if N == 0:\n        return 1\n    if N < 0 or current <= 0:\n        return 0\n\n    include_current = countWays(N - current**K, K, current - 1, memo)\n    exclude_current = countWays(N, K, current - 1, memo)\n\n    memo[(N, current)] = include_current + exclude_current\n    return memo[(N, current)]\n\ndef solve(N, K):\n    current = 1\n    while current**K <= N:\n        current += 1\n    current -= 1\n\n    memo = {}\n    return countWays(N, K, current, memo)\n\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    result = solve(N, K)\n    print(result)\n``` \n\nThis summary encapsulates the problem-solving process and the strategies employed, which can be useful for similar future problems involving combinations and recursive solutions.",
    "reflection": "The official solution employs a dynamic programming approach to efficiently count the number of ways to express a number \\( N \\) as the sum of unique integers raised to the power \\( K \\). Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The solution uses an array `reach` where `reach[i]` represents the number of ways to sum up to \\( i \\) using unique integers raised to the power \\( n \\). This is initialized with `reach[0] = 1`, indicating that there is one way to achieve a sum of zero (by using no numbers).\n\n2. **Iterating Over Powers**: The outer loop iterates over integers \\( i \\) starting from 1, calculating \\( i^n \\) until it exceeds \\( x \\). This ensures that only valid powers are considered.\n\n3. **Updating the Reach Array**: For each valid power \\( i^n \\), the inner loop updates the `reach` array in reverse order. This prevents overwriting values that are still needed for the current iteration. The inner loop checks all sums that can be formed by adding \\( i^n \\) to previously computed sums.\n\n4. **Final Output**: After processing all integers, the final result is found in `reach[x]`, which gives the total number of ways to express \\( x \\) as the sum of unique integers raised to the power \\( n \\).\n\n### Key Takeaways:\n- The use of a dynamic programming array allows for efficient counting of combinations without redundant calculations.\n- The reverse iteration when updating the `reach` array is crucial to maintain the integrity of the counts for each unique integer.\n- This approach is more efficient than a recursive solution with memoization, especially for larger values of \\( N \\) and \\( K \\), as it avoids the overhead of recursive calls.\n\nIn summary, the official solution effectively combines dynamic programming principles with careful iteration to solve the problem efficiently, which is a valuable technique to remember for similar combinatorial problems in the future.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: solve]\nThis function calculates the number of ways to express a given integer \\( N \\) as the sum of unique integers raised to the power of \\( K \\). It first determines the largest integer whose \\( K \\)-th power is less than or equal to \\( N \\). Then, it initializes a memoization dictionary to store previously computed results for efficiency. Finally, it invokes a recursive counting process to find all valid combinations of integers that satisfy the condition, returning the total count. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases by reading input values for \\( N \\) and \\( K \\). The result is printed for each test case.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to find combinations of unique integers that sum up to a specific number, particularly when the integers are raised to a certain power. This can be applied in combinatorial mathematics, algorithm design, and optimization problems where constraints on uniqueness and powers are present. It can also be relevant in programming contests or interviews where such problems are common, as well as in fields like cryptography or number theory where the properties of numbers are explored."
