The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is \\(N \\times (N - 1) / 2\\).\n\n    #### Key Concepts:\n    1. **Maximum and Minimum Values of f(P):** The maximum value occurs with a descending permutation, while the minimum is 0 (for N = 1).\n    2. **Adjustment of Permutation:** The challenge was to adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K by swapping elements to reduce the contribution of adjacent maximums.\n\n    #### Strategies and Issues:\n    - The initial approach involved starting with a descending permutation and attempting to reduce f(P) by swapping adjacent elements. However, this logic was flawed as it did not effectively account for how adjacent maximums changed with swaps.\n    - The code consistently returned `-1` for valid cases, indicating a failure to construct the desired permutation.\n\n    #### Lessons Learned:\n    - A more systematic approach is needed to generate permutations that can achieve specific values of K. The adjustment logic must be refined to ensure that all possible values of f(P) can be reached.\n    - Future implementations should focus on a clearer strategy for adjusting the permutation based on the difference between the current f(P) and the target K.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n    The following code snippet represents the last attempt, which ultimately failed to pass the test cases:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n        results = []  # To store results for each test case\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum possible f(P)\n        \n            if K > max_f or K < 0:  # Check if K is out of bounds\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n            else:\n                # Start with the descending permutation\n                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                current_f = max_f  # Start with the maximum f(P)\n            \n                # Adjust the permutation to achieve the exact value of K\n                for i in range(N - 1):\n                    if current_f == K:\n                        break\n                    # If we can reduce the current_f by 1, we swap elements\n                    if current_f > K:\n                        # Swap the last two elements to reduce the f(P) value\n                        permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]\n                        current_f -= 1  # Decrease the f(P) value by 1\n            \n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))  # Store the result as a string\n\n        # Print all results at once for efficiency\n        print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n    ```\n\n    This summary encapsulates the core concepts, strategies attempted, and the lessons learned from the problem-solving process.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

However, I overlooked the need to separately account for positive and negative elements in the sequence. The official solution effectively breaks down the problem by categorizing the elements into positive and negative sums, which allows for a clearer assessment of whether the sequence can be made \"good.\"\n\nThe official solution uses two variables, `p` and `q`, to track the sum of positive and negative elements, respectively. This approach is more intuitive because it directly addresses the core requirement: to see if the total positive sum can offset the total negative sum. If the sum of positive elements (`p`) is greater than or equal to the absolute value of the sum of negative elements (`q`), then it is possible to make the sequence good.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n1. **Categorization of Elements:** By separating positive and negative elements, the solution simplifies the logic needed to determine if the sequence can be adjusted to sum to zero.\n2. **Direct Comparison:** The condition `if p >= abs(q)` provides a straightforward check to determine if the sequence can be made good, avoiding unnecessary calculations of total sums and maximum reductions.\n\nThis experience highlights the importance of breaking down problems into manageable parts and considering different perspectives on the data, which can lead to more efficient and effective solutions."

For each test case, it calculates the total sum of the sequence and the maximum possible reduction based on the sequence's length. If the total sum is already zero, it outputs \"YES\". If the total sum is positive but within the allowable reduction limit, it also outputs \"YES\". Otherwise, it outputs \"NO\", indicating that it's not possible to achieve a sum of zero. The function effectively checks the feasibility of transforming the sequence into a \"good\" state based on these conditions.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to determine if a sequence of integers can be manipulated to achieve a specific sum, particularly in competitive programming or algorithm design. It can be applied in problems involving constraints on operations that can be performed on elements of a sequence, such as reducing values based on their indices. Understanding this can help in optimizing solutions for similar problems where the goal is to reach a target sum through allowed operations."
