[BEGIN PROBLEM]
We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.
Each turn, we choose any two rocksÂ and smash them together.Â  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.Â  The result of this smash is:

INFO - [Task id] 495 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a collection of rocks, each with a positive weight. When we smash two rocks together, if they have the same weight, they both get destroyed. If they have different weights, the lighter one gets destroyed, and the heavier one loses weight equal to the lighter one. Our goal is to determine the smallest possible weight of the remaining rock after performing a series of these smash operations.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can think of it as a variation of the "subset sum" problem. We want to find a way to partition the rocks into two groups such that the difference in their total weights is minimized. The smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock will be half of the total weight of all rocks minus the weight of the closest subset we can form to that half. This can be approached using dynamic programming to keep track of possible weights we can achieve with the given rocks.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   1. Calculate the total weight of all rocks.
   2. Initialize a boolean array dp of size (total_weight // 2 + 1) to keep track of achievable weights.
   3. Set dp[0] to True (0 weight is always achievable).
   4. For each rock in the list:
      a. Update the dp array from back to front (to avoid using the same rock multiple times).
   5. Find the largest weight that can be achieved which is less than or equal to total_weight // 2.
   6. The result will be total_weight - 2 * closest_weight.
   ```

    Chapter: Dynamic programming
    Section: Coin problem
    Part: 1/2
    \chapter{Dynamic programming}

    \index{dynamic programming}

    \key{Dynamic programming}
    is a technique that combines the correctness
    of complete search and the efficiency
    of greedy algorithms.
    Dynamic programming can be applied if the
    problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems
    that can be solved independently.

    There are two uses for dynamic programming:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    \key{Finding an optimal solution}:
    We want to find a solution that is
    as large as possible or as small as possible.
    \item
    \key{Counting the number of solutions}:
    We want to calculate the total number of
    possible solutions.
    \end{itemize}

    We will first see how dynamic programming can
    be used to find an optimal solution,
    and then we will use the same idea for
    counting the solutions.

    Understanding dynamic programming is a milestone
    in every competitive programmer's career.
    While the basic idea is simple,
    the challenge is how to apply
    dynamic programming to different problems.
    This chapter introduces a set of classic problems
    that are a good starting point.

    \section{Coin problem}

    We first focus on a problem that we
    have already seen in Chapter 6:
    Given a set of coin values $\texttt{coins} = \{c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_k\}$
    and a target sum of money $n$, our task is to
    form the sum $n$ using as few coins as possible.

    In Chapter 6, we solved the problem using a
    greedy algorithm that always chooses the largest
    possible coin.
    The greedy algorithm works, for example,
    when the coins are the euro coins,
    but in the general case the greedy algorithm
    does not necessarily produce an optimal solution.

    Now is time to solve the problem efficiently
    using dynamic programming, so that the algorithm
    works for any coin set.
    The dynamic programming
    algorithm is based on a recursive function
    that goes through all possibilities how to
    form the sum, like a brute force algorithm.
    However, the dynamic programming
    algorithm is efficient because
    it uses \emph{memoization} and
    calculates the answer to each subproblem only once.

    \subsubsection{Recursive formulation}

    The idea in dynamic programming is to
    formulate the problem recursively so
    that the solution to the problem can be
    calculated from solutions to smaller
    subproblems.
    In the coin problem, a natural recursive
    problem is as follows:
    what is the smallest number of coins
    required to form a sum $x$?

    Let $\texttt{solve}(x)$
    denote the minimum
    number of coins required for a sum $x$.
    The values of the function depend on the
    values of the coins.
    For example, if $\texttt{coins} = \{1,3,4\}$,
    the first values of the function are as follows:

    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    \texttt{solve}(0) & = & 0 \\
    \texttt{solve}(1) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{solve}(2) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(3) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{solve}(4) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{solve}(5) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(6) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(7) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(8) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(9) & = & 3 \\
    \texttt{solve}(10) & = & 3 \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    For example, $\texttt{solve}(10)=3$,
    because at least 3 coins are needed
    to form the sum 10.
    The optimal solution is $3+3+4=10$.

    The essential property of $\texttt{solve}$ is
    that its values can be
    recursively calculated from its smaller values.
    The idea is to focus on the \emph{first}
    coin that we choose for the sum.
    For example, in the above scenario,
    the first coin can be either 1, 3 or 4.
    If we first choose coin 1,
    the remaining task is to form the sum 9
    using the minimum number of coins,
    which is a subproblem of the original problem.
    Of course, the same applies to coins 3 and 4.
    Thus, we can use the following recursive formula
    to calculate the minimum number of coins:
    \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
    \texttt{solve}(x) = \min( & \texttt{solve}(x-1)+1, \\
                               & \texttt{solve}(x-3)+1, \\
                               & \texttt{solve}(x-4)+1).
    \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    The base case of the recursion is $\texttt{solve}(0)=0$,
    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.
    For example,
    \[ \texttt{solve}(10) = \texttt{solve}(7)+1 = \texttt{solve}(4)+2 = \texttt{solve}(0)+3 = 3.\]

    Now we are ready to give a general recursive function
    that calculates the minimum number of
    coins needed to form a sum $x$:
    \begin{equation*}
        \texttt{solve}(x) = \begin{cases}
                   \infty               & x < 0\\
                   0               & x = 0\\
                   \min_{c \in \texttt{coins}} \texttt{solve}(x-c)+1 & x > 0 \\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    First, if $x<0$, the value is $\infty$,
    because it is impossible to form a negative
    sum of money.
    Then, if $x=0$, the value is $0$,
    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.
    Finally, if $x>0$, the variable $c$ goes through
    all possibilities how to choose the first coin
    of the sum.

    Once a recursive function that solves the problem
    has been found,
    we can directly implement a solution in C++
    (the constant \texttt{INF} denotes infinity):

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int solve(int x) {
        if (x < 0) return INF;
        if (x == 0) return 0;
        int best = INF;
        for (auto c : coins) {
            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);
        }
        return best;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Still, this function is not efficient,
    because there may be an exponential number of ways
    to construct the sum.
    However, next we will see how to make the
    function efficient using a technique called memoization.

    \subsubsection{Using memoization}

    \index{memoization}

    The idea of dynamic programming is to use
    \key{memoization} to efficiently calculate
    values of a recursive function.
    This means that the values of the function
    are stored in an array after calculating them.
    For each parameter, the value of the function
    is calculated recursively only once, and after this,
    the value can be directly retrieved from the array.

    In this problem, we use arrays
    \begin{lstlisting}
    bool ready[N];
    int value[N];
    \end{lstlisting}

    where $\texttt{ready}[x]$ indicates
    whether the value of $\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been calculated,
    and if it is, $\texttt{value}[x]$
    contains this value.
    The constant $N$ has been chosen so
    that all required values fit in the arrays.

    Now the function can be efficiently
    implemented as follows:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int solve(int x) {
        if (x < 0) return INF;
        if (x == 0) return 0;
        if (ready[x]) return value[x];
        int best = INF;
        for (auto c : coins) {
            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);
        }
        value[x] = best;
        ready[x] = true;
        return best;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The function handles the base cases
    $x<0$ and $x=0$ as previously.
    Then the function checks from
    $\texttt{ready}[x]$ if
    $\texttt{solve}(x)$ has already been stored
    in $\texttt{value}[x]$,
    and if it is, the function directly returns it.
    Otherwise the function calculates the value
    of $\texttt{solve}(x)$
    recursively and stores it in $\texttt{value}[x]$.

    This function works efficiently,
    because the answer for each parameter $x$
    is calculated recursively only once.
    After a value of $\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been stored in $\texttt{value}[x]$,
    it can be efficiently retrieved whenever the
    function will be called again with the parameter $x$.
    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(nk)$,
    where $n$ is the target sum and $k$ is the number of coins.

    Note that we can also \emph{iteratively}
    construct the array \texttt{value} using
    a loop that simply calculates all the values
    of $\texttt{solve}$ for parameters $0 \ldots n

INFO - [Task id] 495 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We have a collection of rocks, each with a positive integer weight. When we smash two rocks together, if they have the same weight, they both get destroyed. If they have different weights, the lighter rock is destroyed, and the heavier rock's weight is reduced by the weight of the lighter rock. The goal is to determine the smallest possible weight of the remaining rock after performing all possible smash operations.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   The problem can be approached by considering the weights of the rocks as a set of integers. The key insight is that the final weight of the remaining rock can be thought of as a variation of the "subset sum" problem. We can use dynamic programming to explore all possible combinations of weights that can be formed by smashing the rocks together. The idea is to find the minimum possible weight that can be achieved after all possible operations.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Calculate the total weight of all rocks.
   - Use dynamic programming to find the closest weight to half of the total weight that can be formed using the rocks.
   - The result will be the total weight minus twice the closest weight found, which gives the smallest possible weight of the remaining rock.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   function lastStoneWeightII(stones):

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.
Each turn, we choose any two rocksÂ and smash them together.Â  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.Â  The result of this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;

INFO - [Task id] 495 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We have a collection of rocks, each with a positive integer weight. When we smash two rocks together, if they have the same weight, they both get destroyed. If they have different weights, the lighter rock is destroyed, and the heavier rock's weight is reduced by the weight of the lighter rock. The goal is to determine the smallest possible weight of the remaining rock after performing all possible smash operations.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   The problem can be approached by considering the weights of the rocks as a set of integers. The key insight is that the final weight of the remaining rock can be thought of as a variation of the "subset sum" problem. We can use dynamic programming to explore all possible combinations of weights that can be formed by smashing the rocks together. The idea is to find the minimum possible weight that can be achieved after all possible operations.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Calculate the total weight of all rocks.
   - Use dynamic programming to find the closest weight to half of the total weight that can be formed using the rocks.
   - The result will be the total weight minus twice the closest weight found, which gives the smallest possible weight of the remaining rock.

   Pseudocode:
   ```
   function lastStoneWeightII(stones):
       total_weight = sum(stones)
       target = total_weight // 2
       dp = array of size (target + 1) initialized to False
       dp[0] = True

INFO - [Task id] 495 [generation text] In this task, I was required to solve a problem involving the combination of rocks with positive integer weights, where the goal was to determine the smallest possible weight of the remaining rock after performing a series of smash operations. The problem can be conceptualized as a variation of the subset sum problem, where the objective is to find the closest weight to half of the total weight of the rocks.

The solution involved using dynamic programming to track achievable weights. I created a DP array to represent whether a certain weight could be formed using the available rocks. The approach was to iterate through each rock and update the DP array accordingly. Finally, I searched for the largest achievable weight close to half of the total weight, which allowed me to compute the minimum possible weight of the last remaining rock.

The final implementation was successful, passing all test cases, including the provided example. The key takeaway from this experience is the effectiveness of dynamic programming in solving subset-related problems, particularly when dealing with combinations and weights. The solution was efficient and straightforward, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's requirements and constraints. 

Here is the final code snippet for reference:

```python

    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = {0}
        total = sum(stones)
        for stone in stones:
            dp |= {_sum + stone for _sum in dp}
        return min(abs(total - _sum - _sum) for _sum in dp)

INFO - [Task id] 495 [generation text] The official solution employs a set-based dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of minimizing the weight of the last remaining rock. The key insight is to track all possible sums that can be formed using the weights of the rocks. This is done by iterating through each stone and updating a set of achievable sums. The final result is derived by calculating the minimum difference between the total weight and twice each achievable sum, which effectively gives the smallest possible weight of the last rock.

### Key Steps in the Official Solution:
1. **Initialization**: Start with a set `dp` containing only the sum of 0, representing the achievable weight of 0.
2. **Iterate through Stones**: For each stone, update the set `dp` by adding the current stone's weight to each of the existing sums in `dp`. This is done using set comprehension to ensure all combinations are considered.
3. **Calculate Minimum Weight**: Finally, compute the minimum of the absolute differences between the total weight and twice each sum in `dp`. This gives the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock.

### Insights:
- The use of a set allows for efficient tracking of unique sums without needing to manage an array, which can simplify the implementation.
- The final calculation leverages the relationship between the total weight and the achievable sums to derive the result in a straightforward manner.
- This approach is efficient in both time and space, as it avoids the need for a large DP array and directly computes the result from the set of sums.

Overall, the official solution is effective and concise, demonstrating a clever use of set operations to solve the problem efficiently.
