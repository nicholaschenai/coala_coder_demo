    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We have a collection of rocks, each with a positive integer weight. When we smash two rocks together, if they have the same weight, they both get destroyed. If they have different weights, the lighter rock is destroyed, and the heavier rock's weight is reduced by the weight of the lighter rock. The goal is to determine the smallest possible weight of the remaining rock after performing all possible smash operations.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   The problem can be approached by considering the weights of the rocks as a set of integers. The key insight is that the final weight of the remaining rock can be thought of as a variation of the \"subset sum\" problem. We can use dynamic programming to explore all possible combinations of weights that can be formed by smashing the rocks together. The idea is to find the minimum possible weight that can be achieved after all possible operations.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Calculate the total weight of all rocks.\n   - Use dynamic programming to find the closest weight to half of the total weight that can be formed using the rocks.\n   - The result will be the total weight minus twice the closest weight found, which gives the smallest possible weight of the remaining rock.\n\n   Pseudocode:\n   ```\n   function lastStoneWeightII(stones):\n       total_weight = sum(stones)\n       target = total_weight // 2\n       dp = array of size (target + 1) initialized to False\n       dp[0] = True\n       \n       for each stone in stones:\n           for j from target down to stone:\n               dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]\n       \n       for j from target down to 0:\n           if dp[j] is True:\n               return total_weight - 2 * j\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Calculate the total weight of all stones\n        total_weight = sum(stones)\n        # The target is half of the total weight\n        target = total_weight // 2\n        # Create a DP array to track achievable weights\n        dp = [False] * (target + 1)\n        dp[0] = True  # We can always achieve a weight of 0\n        \n        # Iterate through each stone\n        for stone in stones:\n            # Update the DP array from back to front\n            for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):\n                dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]\n        \n        # Find the largest achievable weight close to target\n        for j in range(target, -1, -1):\n            if dp[j]:\n                # The minimum possible weight of the last stone\n                return total_weight - 2 * j\n```",
