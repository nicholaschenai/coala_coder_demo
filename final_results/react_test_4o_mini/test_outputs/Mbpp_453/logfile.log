You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/453 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of all even factors of a given number. For example, if the input is 18, the even factors are 2, 6, and 18, and their sum is 26.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the sum of even factors of a number, we can:
   - Loop through all numbers from 1 to the given number.
   - For each number, check if it is a factor of the given number (i.e., if the given number is divisible by this number).
   - If it is a factor and it is even, add it to a running total.
   - Finally, return the total sum of the even factors.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function sumofFactors(n):
       initialize sum to 0
       for i from 1 to n:
           if n is divisible by i:
               if i is even:
                   add i to sum
       return sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def sumofFactors(n):
    # Initialize the sum of even factors to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Loop through all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Check if i is a factor of n
        if n % i == 0:
            # Check if the factor is even
            if i % 2 == 0:
                # Add the even factor to the total sum
                total_sum += i
                
    # Return the total sum of even factors
    return total_sum
```
