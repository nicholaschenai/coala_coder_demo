    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of all even factors of a given number. For example, if the input is 18, the even factors are 2, 6, and 18, and their sum is 26.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the sum of even factors of a number, we can:\n   - Loop through all numbers from 1 to the given number.\n   - For each number, check if it is a factor of the given number (i.e., if the given number is divisible by this number).\n   - If it is a factor and it is even, add it to a running total.\n   - Finally, return the total sum of the even factors.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function sumofFactors(n):\n       initialize sum to 0\n       for i from 1 to n:\n           if n is divisible by i:\n               if i is even:\n                   add i to sum\n       return sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef sumofFactors(n):\n    # Initialize the sum of even factors to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Loop through all numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Check if i is a factor of n\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # Check if the factor is even\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                # Add the even factor to the total sum\n                total_sum += i\n                \n    # Return the total sum of even factors\n    return total_sum\n```",
