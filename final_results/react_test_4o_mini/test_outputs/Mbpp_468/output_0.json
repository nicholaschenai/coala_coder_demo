    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and finds the maximum product that can be obtained by multiplying the numbers in an increasing subsequence of that list. An increasing subsequence means that each number in the subsequence must be greater than the one before it.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will maintain an array where each element at index `i` represents the maximum product of an increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. We will iterate through the list, and for each element, we will check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we will update the maximum product for the current element. Finally, we will return the maximum value from our array of products.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function max_product(arr):\n       if arr is empty:\n           return 0\n       \n       create a list 'max_products' of the same length as arr, initialized with 1\n       \n       for i from 0 to length of arr - 1:\n           for j from 0 to i - 1:\n               if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                   max_products[i] = max(max_products[i], max_products[j] * arr[i])\n       \n       return the maximum value in max_products\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef max_product(arr):\n    # If the array is empty, return 0\n    if not arr:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Create a list to store the maximum products for increasing subsequences\n    max_products = [1] * len(arr)\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the array\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        # Check all previous elements to find increasing subsequences\n        for j in range(i):\n            if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                # Update the maximum product for the current element\n                max_products[i] = max(max_products[i], max_products[j] * arr[i])\n    \n    # Return the maximum value found in max_products\n    return max(max_products)\n```",
