INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/731 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cone given its radius (r) and height (h). The function should return the calculated area as a floating-point number.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the lateral surface area of a cone, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Lateral Surface Area} = \pi r l
   \]
   where \( l \) is the slant height of the cone. The slant height can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   l = \sqrt{r^2 + h^2}
   \]
   After calculating the slant height, we can substitute it back into the lateral surface area formula to get the final result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   FUNCTION lateralsurface_cone(r, h):
       CALCULATE slant_height = sqrt(r^2 + h^2)
       CALCULATE lateral_surface_area = pi * r * slant_height
       RETURN lateral_surface_area
   ```

# Function to calculate the lateral surface area of a cone
def lateralsurface_cone(r: float, h: float) -> float:

    slant_height = math.sqrt(r**2 + h**2)
    # Calculate the lateral surface area using the formula
    lateral_surface_area = math.pi * r * slant_height
    # Return the calculated lateral surface area
