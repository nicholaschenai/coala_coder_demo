    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name and a score. The function should calculate the total score for each unique name and return the name with the highest total score along with that score.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - We will create a dictionary to keep track of the total scores for each name.\n   - We will iterate through the list of tuples, adding each score to the corresponding name in the dictionary.\n   - After processing all tuples, we will find the name with the maximum score in the dictionary.\n   - Finally, we will return that name along with its total score.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function max_aggregate(tuples):\n       create an empty dictionary called score_dict\n       for each tuple in tuples:\n           extract name and score from the tuple\n           if name is not in score_dict:\n               add name to score_dict with initial score\n           else:\n               add score to the existing score for that name\n       initialize max_name and max_score\n       for each name, score in score_dict:\n           if score is greater than max_score:\n               update max_name and max_score\n       return (max_name, max_score)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef max_aggregate(tuples):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store total scores for each name\n    score_dict = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the list\n    for name, score in tuples:\n        # If the name is not in the dictionary, add it with the score\n        if name not in score_dict:\n            score_dict[name] = score\n        else:\n            # If the name is already in the dictionary, add the score to the existing total\n            score_dict[name] += score\n    \n    # Initialize variables to track the maximum score and corresponding name\n    max_name = None\n    max_score = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the dictionary to find the name with the maximum score\n    for name, score in score_dict.items():\n        if score > max_score:\n            max_name = name\n            max_score = score\n    \n    # Return the name with the maximum score and the score itself\n    return (max_name, max_score)\n```",
