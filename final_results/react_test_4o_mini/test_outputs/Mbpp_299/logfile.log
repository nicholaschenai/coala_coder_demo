You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/299 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name and a score. The function should calculate the total score for each unique name and return the name with the highest total score along with that score.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will create a dictionary to keep track of the total scores for each name.
   - We will iterate through the list of tuples, adding each score to the corresponding name in the dictionary.
   - After processing all tuples, we will find the name with the maximum score in the dictionary.
   - Finally, we will return that name along with its total score.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_aggregate(tuples):
       create an empty dictionary called score_dict
       for each tuple in tuples:
           extract name and score from the tuple
           if name is not in score_dict:
               add name to score_dict with initial score
           else:
               add score to the existing score for that name
       initialize max_name and max_score
       for each name, score in score_dict:
           if score is greater than max_score:
               update max_name and max_score
       return (max_name, max_score)
   ```
