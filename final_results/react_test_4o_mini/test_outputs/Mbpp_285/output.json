    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that checks if a given string contains the character 'a' followed by either two or three 'b' characters. If the string meets this condition, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and look for the character 'a'. Once we find 'a', we will check the next characters to see if they are 'b'. We need to ensure that there are exactly two or three 'b' characters following 'a'. If we find such a pattern, we return `True`. If we reach the end of the string without finding this pattern, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function text_match_two_three(s: str) -> bool:\n       for i from 0 to length of s - 1:\n           if s[i] is 'a':\n               if (i + 2 < length of s and s[i + 1] is 'b' and s[i + 2] is 'b'):\n                   return True\n               if (i + 3 < length of s and s[i + 1] is 'b' and s[i + 2] is 'b' and s[i + 3] is 'b'):\n                   return True\n       return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef text_match_two_three(s: str) -> bool:\n    # Iterate through each character in the string\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # Check if the current character is 'a'\n        if s[i] == 'a':\n            # Check for two 'b's following 'a'\n            if i + 2 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == 'b' and s[i + 2] == 'b':\n                return True\n            # Check for three 'b's following 'a'\n            if i + 3 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == 'b' and s[i + 2] == 'b' and s[i + 3] == 'b':\n                return True\n    # Return False if the pattern is not found\n    return False\n```",
