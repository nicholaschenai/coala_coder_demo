You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/285 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given string contains the character 'a' followed by either two or three 'b' characters. If the string meets this condition, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and look for the character 'a'. Once we find 'a', we will check the next characters to see if they are 'b'. We need to ensure that there are exactly two or three 'b' characters following 'a'. If we find such a pattern, we return `True`. If we reach the end of the string without finding this pattern, we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function text_match_two_three(s: str) -> bool:
       for i from 0 to length of s - 1:
           if s[i] is 'a':
               if (i + 2 < length of s and s[i + 1] is 'b' and s[i + 2] is 'b'):
                   return True
               if (i + 3 < length of s and s[i + 1] is 'b' and s[i + 2] is 'b' and s[i + 3] is 'b'):
                   return True
       return False
   ```

def text_match_two_three(s: str) -> bool:
