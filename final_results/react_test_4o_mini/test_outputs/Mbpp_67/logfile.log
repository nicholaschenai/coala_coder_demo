You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/67 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that calculates the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers. Specifically, for the input `2`, the function should return `2`, which indicates that there are two ways to partition a set of size `2`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   Bell numbers represent the number of ways to partition a set. The Bell number for a given integer `n` can be computed using a recursive relationship or through a dynamic programming approach. The Bell number can be calculated using the formula:
   - B(n+1) = Î£ (C(n, k) * B(k)) for k from 0 to n, where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient.
   We will start with the base case B(0) = 1 and build up to B(n) using this relationship.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function bell_number(n):
       if n == 0:
           return 1
       create a 2D array bell of size (n+1) x (n+1)
       initialize bell[0][0] = 1
       for i from 1 to n:
           bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1]
           for j from 1 to i:
               bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]
       return bell[n][0]
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:

def bell_number(n: int) -> int:
