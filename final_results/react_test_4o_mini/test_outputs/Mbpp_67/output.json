    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that calculates the number of ways to partition a set of Bell numbers. Specifically, for the input `2`, the function should return `2`, which indicates that there are two ways to partition a set of size `2`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   Bell numbers represent the number of ways to partition a set. The Bell number for a given integer `n` can be computed using a recursive relationship or through a dynamic programming approach. The Bell number can be calculated using the formula:\n   - B(n+1) = \u03a3 (C(n, k) * B(k)) for k from 0 to n, where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient.\n   We will start with the base case B(0) = 1 and build up to B(n) using this relationship.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function bell_number(n):\n       if n == 0:\n           return 1\n       create a 2D array bell of size (n+1) x (n+1)\n       initialize bell[0][0] = 1\n       for i from 1 to n:\n           bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1]\n           for j from 1 to i:\n               bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]\n       return bell[n][0]\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef bell_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Base case: the Bell number for 0 is 1\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Create a 2D array to store Bell numbers\n    bell = [[0 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    \n    # The first Bell number is 1\n    bell[0][0] = 1\n    \n    # Fill the Bell triangle\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # The first value in each row is the last value of the previous row\n        bell[i][0] = bell[i - 1][i - 1]\n        \n        # Fill the rest of the row\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            bell[i][j] = bell[i - 1][j - 1] + bell[i][j - 1]\n    \n    # The Bell number for n is in the first column of the nth row\n    return bell[n][0]\n```",
