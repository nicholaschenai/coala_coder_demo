However, the output includes a space character when the input string contains spaces. \n   - The expected output in the assertion does not include any spaces, which indicates that the function should only include non-space characters in the resulting tuple.\n\n2. **Step-by-step analysis of where I went wrong in my latest solution**:\n   - I used the `tuple()` function directly on the string, which includes all characters, including spaces. \n   - I did not account for the requirement to exclude spaces from the output tuple. The function needs to filter out spaces before converting the string into a tuple.\n\nTo correct this, I will modify the function to iterate through the string and only include characters that are not spaces in the tuple. I will implement this change in the final solution. \n\nHere\u2019s the updated code:\n\n```python\ndef string_to_tuple(s: str) -> tuple:\n    # Create a list of characters excluding spaces\n    filtered_chars = [char for char in s if char != ' ']\n    # Convert the list to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(filtered_chars)\n\n```"
