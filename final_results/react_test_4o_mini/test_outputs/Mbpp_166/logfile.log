You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/166 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that counts how many pairs of integers in a given list can be combined using the XOR operation to produce an even number.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To determine if the XOR of two integers is even, we can use the property that the XOR of two integers is even if both integers are either even or both are odd. Therefore, we can count the number of even integers and the number of odd integers in the list. The number of valid pairs can then be calculated using combinations:
   - The number of ways to choose 2 even integers from the count of even integers.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 odd integers from the count of odd integers.
   Finally, we sum these two counts to get the total number of pairs that XOR to an even number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_even_pair(lst):
       initialize even_count to 0
       initialize odd_count to 0
       
       for each number in lst:
           if number is even:
               increment even_count
           else:
               increment odd_count
       
       even_pairs = (even_count * (even_count - 1)) / 2
       odd_pairs = (odd_count * (odd_count - 1)) / 2
       
       return even_pairs + odd_pairs
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def find_even_pair(lst):
    # Initialize counters for even and odd numbers
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    # Count the number of even and odd integers in the list
    for number in lst:
        if number % 2 == 0:  # Check if the number is even
            even_count += 1
