You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/311 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes an integer as input and sets the leftmost bit that is currently unset (0) to 1. The output should be the new integer value after this modification.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Convert the integer to its binary representation.
   - Identify the leftmost bit that is 0.
   - Change that bit to 1.
   - Convert the modified binary representation back to an integer and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function set_left_most_unset_bit(n):
       # Convert n to binary string
       binary_str = convert n to binary
       
       # Find the leftmost '0' in the binary string
       for each bit in binary_str from left to right:
           if bit is '0':
               # Change this bit to '1'
               set this bit to '1'
               break
       
       # Convert the modified binary string back to an integer
       new_integer = convert modified binary string back to integer
       return new_integer
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def set_left_most_unset_bit(n: int) -> int:
    # Convert the number to binary and remove the '0b' prefix
    binary_str = bin(n)[2:]
    
    # Find the leftmost '0' and replace it with '1'
    modified_binary_str = ''
    found_zero = False
    
    for bit in binary_str:
        if bit == '0' and not found_zero:
            modified_binary_str += '1'  # Set the leftmost unset bit
            found_zero = True
        else:
            modified_binary_str += bit  # Keep the rest the same
    
    # If no zero was found, we need to add a '1' at the end
    if not found_zero:
        modified_binary_str += '1'
    
    # Convert the modified binary string back to an integer
    new_integer = int(modified_binary_str, 2)
    return new_integer
