If the string is empty or contains any non-digit characters (excluding the sign), it should return `False`. If it meets the criteria, it should return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function check_integer(s: string) -> bool:\n       if s is empty:\n           return False\n       if s starts with '+' or '-' and length of s is greater than 1:\n           check the rest of the string (from index 1) to see if all characters are digits\n       else:\n           check if all characters in s are digits\n       return True if all characters are digits, otherwise return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef check_integer(s: str) -> bool:\n    # Check if the string is empty\n    if len(s) == 0:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check for a sign at the beginning\n    if s[0] in ['+', '-']:\n        # If there's a sign, ensure the rest of the string is not empty and consists of digits\n        return len(s) > 1 and s[1:].isdigit()\n    \n    # Check if the entire string consists of digits\n    return s.isdigit()\n```"
