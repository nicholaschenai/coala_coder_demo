You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/113 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given string can be interpreted as an integer. If the string represents an integer, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if a string represents an integer, we can check if the string consists only of digits, optionally allowing for a leading '+' or '-' sign. If the string is empty or contains any non-digit characters (excluding the sign), it should return `False`. If it meets the criteria, it should return `True`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function check_integer(s: string) -> bool:
       if s is empty:
           return False
       if s starts with '+' or '-' and length of s is greater than 1:
           check the rest of the string (from index 1) to see if all characters are digits
       else:
           check if all characters in s are digits
       return True if all characters are digits, otherwise return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def check_integer(s: str) -> bool:
    # Check if the string is empty
    if len(s) == 0:
        return False
    
    # Check for a sign at the beginning
    if s[0] in ['+', '-']:
        # If there's a sign, ensure the rest of the string is not empty and consists of digits
        return len(s) > 1 and s[1:].isdigit()
    
    # Check if the entire string consists of digits
    return s.isdigit()
