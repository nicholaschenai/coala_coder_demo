INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/394 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/394 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given tuple contains any duplicate elements. If there are duplicates, the function should return `False`; if all elements are unique, it should return `True`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if a tuple has duplicates, we can use a set to keep track of the elements we have seen so far. As we iterate through the tuple, we will check if each element is already in the set. If it is, we have found a duplicate and can return `False`. If we finish checking all elements without finding duplicates, we return `True`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function check_distinct(tup):
       create an empty set called seen
       for each element in tup:
           if element is in seen:
               return False
           add element to seen
       return True
   ```

def check_distinct(tup):
    # Create an empty set to keep track of seen elements
    seen = set()
    
    # Iterate through each element in the tuple

        # If the element is already in the seen set, return False
        if element in seen:
            return False
        # Add the element to the seen set
        seen.add(element)
    
    # If no duplicates were found, return True
