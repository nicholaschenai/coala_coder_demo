    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that checks if a given tuple contains any duplicate elements. If there are duplicates, the function should return `False`; if all elements are unique, it should return `True`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if a tuple has duplicates, we can use a set to keep track of the elements we have seen so far. As we iterate through the tuple, we will check if each element is already in the set. If it is, we have found a duplicate and can return `False`. If we finish checking all elements without finding duplicates, we return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function check_distinct(tup):\n       create an empty set called seen\n       for each element in tup:\n           if element is in seen:\n               return False\n           add element to seen\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef check_distinct(tup):\n    # Create an empty set to keep track of seen elements\n    seen = set()\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the tuple\n    for element in tup:\n        # If the element is already in the seen set, return False\n        if element in seen:\n            return False\n        # Add the element to the seen set\n        seen.add(element)\n    \n    # If no duplicates were found, return True\n    return True\n```",
