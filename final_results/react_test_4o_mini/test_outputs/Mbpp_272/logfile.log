You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

Write a function that takes in a list of tuples and returns a list containing the rear element of each tuple.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/272 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples as input. Each tuple contains multiple elements, and we want to extract the last element from each tuple and return these last elements as a new list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each tuple in the provided list. For each tuple, we will access the last element (which can be done using negative indexing) and collect these last elements into a new list. Finally, we will return this new list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function rear_extract(tuples_list):
       create an empty list called result
       for each tuple in tuples_list:
           get the last element of the tuple
           append the last element to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def rear_extract(tuples_list):
    # Create an empty list to store the last elements
    result = []
    # Iterate through each tuple in the input list
    for tup in tuples_list:
        # Get the last element of the tuple using negative indexing
        last_element = tup[-1]
        # Append the last element to the result list
        result.append(last_element)
    # Return the list containing the last elements of each tuple
    return result
