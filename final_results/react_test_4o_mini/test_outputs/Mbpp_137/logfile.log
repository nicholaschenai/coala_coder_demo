You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/137 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that calculates the ratio of zeroes to non-zero integers in a given list of integers. The output should be a floating-point number representing this ratio.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Count the number of zeroes in the list.
   - Count the number of non-zero integers in the list.
   - Calculate the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes by dividing the count of zeroes by the count of non-zeroes.
   - If there are no non-zero integers, we should handle this case to avoid division by zero.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function zero_count(arr):
       initialize zero_count to 0
       initialize non_zero_count to 0
       
       for each number in arr:
           if number is 0:
               increment zero_count
           else:
               increment non_zero_count
       
       if non_zero_count is 0:
           return 0.0  // or handle as needed
       
       return zero_count / non_zero_count
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def zero_count(arr):
    # Initialize counters for zeroes and non-zeroes
    zero_count = 0
    non_zero_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each number in the array
    for number in arr:
        if number == 0:
            # Increment zero count if the number is zero
            zero_count += 1
        else:
            # Increment non-zero count if the number is not zero
            non_zero_count += 1
    
    # If there are no non-zero numbers, return 0.0 to avoid division by zero
    if non_zero_count == 0:
        return 0.0
