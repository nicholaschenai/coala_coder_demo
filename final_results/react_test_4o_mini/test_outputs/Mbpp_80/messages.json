A tetrahedral number represents a pyramid with a triangular base and three sides (a tetrahedron). The nth tetrahedral number can be calculated using a specific formula.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   The nth tetrahedral number can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   T(n) = \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}\n   \\]\n   This formula derives from the fact that the nth tetrahedral number is the sum of the first n triangular numbers. We will implement this formula in a function that takes an integer n as input and returns the corresponding tetrahedral number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION tetrahedral_number(n):\n       IF n is less than 1:\n           RETURN 0\n       ENDIF\n       tetrahedral_number = (n * (n + 1) * (n + 2)) / 6\n       RETURN tetrahedral_number\n   END FUNCTION\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the nth tetrahedral number\ndef tetrahedral_number(n):\n    # Check if n is less than 1, return 0 (though not specified, it's a safe guard)\n    if n < 1:\n        return 0\n    # Calculate the nth tetrahedral number using the formula\n    return (n * (n + 1) * (n + 2)) // 6  # Use integer division\n\n```"
