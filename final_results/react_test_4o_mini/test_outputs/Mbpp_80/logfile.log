You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/80 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the nth tetrahedral number. A tetrahedral number represents a pyramid with a triangular base and three sides (a tetrahedron). The nth tetrahedral number can be calculated using a specific formula.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   The nth tetrahedral number can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   T(n) = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}
   \]
   This formula derives from the fact that the nth tetrahedral number is the sum of the first n triangular numbers. We will implement this formula in a function that takes an integer n as input and returns the corresponding tetrahedral number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION tetrahedral_number(n):
       IF n is less than 1:
           RETURN 0
       ENDIF
       tetrahedral_number = (n * (n + 1) * (n + 2)) / 6
       RETURN tetrahedral_number
   END FUNCTION
   ```

# Define a function to calculate the nth tetrahedral number
def tetrahedral_number(n):

    if n < 1:
        return 0
    # Calculate the nth tetrahedral number using the formula
    return (n * (n + 1) * (n + 2)) // 6  # Use integer division
