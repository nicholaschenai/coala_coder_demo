You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/726 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple. The new tuple should contain products of adjacent elements from the input tuple. Specifically, for each element in the input tuple (except the last one), we will multiply it by the next element.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through the input tuple, taking each element and multiplying it by the next element.
   - We will store these products in a new tuple.
   - Finally, we will return the new tuple containing the products.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function multiply_elements(input_tuple):
       create an empty list to store products
       for i from 0 to length of input_tuple - 2:
           product = input_tuple[i] * input_tuple[i + 1]
           append product to the list
       convert the list to a tuple
       return the tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def multiply_elements(input_tuple):
    # Create an empty list to store products
    products = []
    
    # Iterate through the input tuple up to the second last element
    for i in range(len(input_tuple) - 1):
        # Calculate the product of the current element and the next element
        product = input_tuple[i] * input_tuple[i + 1]
        # Append the product to the list
        products.append(product)
    
    # Convert the list of products to a tuple
    return tuple(products)
