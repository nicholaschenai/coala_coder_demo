    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple. The new tuple should contain products of adjacent elements from the input tuple. Specifically, for each element in the input tuple (except the last one), we will multiply it by the next element.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate through the input tuple, taking each element and multiplying it by the next element.\n   - We will store these products in a new tuple.\n   - Finally, we will return the new tuple containing the products.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function multiply_elements(input_tuple):\n       create an empty list to store products\n       for i from 0 to length of input_tuple - 2:\n           product = input_tuple[i] * input_tuple[i + 1]\n           append product to the list\n       convert the list to a tuple\n       return the tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef multiply_elements(input_tuple):\n    # Create an empty list to store products\n    products = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the input tuple up to the second last element\n    for i in range(len(input_tuple) - 1):\n        # Calculate the product of the current element and the next element\n        product = input_tuple[i] * input_tuple[i + 1]\n        # Append the product to the list\n        products.append(product)\n    \n    # Convert the list of products to a tuple\n    return tuple(products)\n```",
