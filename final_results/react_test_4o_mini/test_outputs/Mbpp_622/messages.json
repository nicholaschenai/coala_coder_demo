Since both lists are of the same size, the median will be the average of the two middle elements in the merged list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `get_median` that takes two lists and their size as parameters.\n   - Initialize an empty list to hold the merged elements.\n   - Use two pointers to traverse both lists and merge them into the new list in sorted order.\n   - Once merged, calculate the median:\n     - If the size is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n     - If the size is odd, the median is the middle element.\n   - Return the median.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2, size):\n    merged = []\n    i, j = 0, 0\n    \n    # Merge the two sorted lists\n    while i < size and j < size:\n        if list1[i] < list2[j]:\n            merged.append(list1[i])\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            merged.append(list2[j])\n            j += 1\n    \n    # If there are remaining elements in list1\n    while i < size:\n        merged.append(list1[i])\n        i += 1\n    \n    # If there are remaining elements in list2\n    while j < size:\n        merged.append(list2[j])\n        j += 1\n    \n    return merged\n\ndef get_median(list1, list2, size):\n    # Merge the two sorted lists\n    merged = merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2, size)\n    \n    # Calculate the median\n    mid_index = size // 2\n    if size % 2 == 0:\n        # If even, average the two middle elements\n        median = (merged[mid_index - 1] + merged[mid_index]) / 2\n    else:\n        # If odd, take the middle element\n        median = merged[mid_index]\n    \n    return median\n```"

        "content": "Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.\n\n1. **Understanding the Median Calculation:**\n   The median of two sorted lists of the same size should be calculated from the combined sorted list. The median is defined as:\n   - If the total number of elements is odd, the median is the middle element.\n   - If the total number of elements is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n\n2. **Identifying the Issue:**\n   In the provided code, the merging process is correct, but the calculation of the median is not properly handling the case when the size is odd or even. The median should be calculated based on the merged list's length, which is `2 * size` (since both lists are of the same size).\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong:**\n   - The merging logic is correct, but the median calculation logic does not account for the fact that the merged list will have `2 * size` elements.\n   - The median calculation should always consider the two middle elements of the merged list, regardless of whether the size is odd or even.\n\n4. **Correcting the Code:**\n   I need to adjust the median calculation to always take the average of the two middle elements from the merged list, since the total number of elements will always be even (2 * size).\n\nNow, let's implement the corrected solution.\n\n```python\ndef merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2, size):\n    merged = []\n    i, j = 0, 0\n    \n    # Merge the two sorted lists\n    while i < size and j < size:\n        if list1[i] < list2[j]:\n            merged.append(list1[i])\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            merged.append(list2[j])\n            j += 1\n    \n    # If there are remaining elements in list1\n    while i < size:\n        merged.append(list1[i])\n        i += 1\n    \n    # If there are remaining elements in list2\n    while j < size:\n        merged.append(list2[j])\n        j += 1\n    \n    return merged\n\ndef get_median(list1, list2, size):\n    # Merge the two sorted lists\n    merged = merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2, size)\n    \n    # Calculate the median\n    mid_index = size  # Since merged list has 2 * size elements\n    median = (merged[mid_index - 1] + merged[mid_index]) / 2\n    \n    return median\n```"
