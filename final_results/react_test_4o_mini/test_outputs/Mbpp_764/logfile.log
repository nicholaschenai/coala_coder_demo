You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/764 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and counts how many digits (0-9) are present in that string. The function should return this count.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the input string. For each character, we will check if it is a digit. If it is, we will increment a counter. At the end of the iteration, we will return the counter which represents the total number of digits found in the string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function number_ctr(input_string):
       initialize a counter to 0
       for each character in input_string:
           if character is a digit:
               increment the counter
       return the counter
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def is_digit(char):
    # Check if the character is a digit
    return '0' <= char <= '9'

def number_ctr(input_string: str) -> int:
    # Initialize a counter to count digits
    count = 0
    # Iterate through each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # If the character is a digit, increment the counter
        if is_digit(char):
            count += 1
    # Return the total count of digits
    return count
```
