You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/806 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns the length of the longest consecutive sequence of uppercase letters found in that string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string while keeping track of the current count of consecutive uppercase letters. If we encounter an uppercase letter, we increment our current count. If we encounter a lowercase letter or a non-letter character, we compare the current count with the maximum count found so far and reset the current count to zero. At the end of the iteration, we need to check one last time to ensure we account for any uppercase sequence that might end at the last character of the string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_run_uppercase(s):
       initialize max_count to 0
       initialize current_count to 0
       
       for each character in s:
           if character is uppercase:
               increment current_count
           else:
               if current_count > max_count:
                   update max_count
               reset current_count to 0
       
       if current_count > max_count:
           update max_count
       
       return max_count
   ```
