    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns the length of the longest consecutive sequence of uppercase letters found in that string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string while keeping track of the current count of consecutive uppercase letters. If we encounter an uppercase letter, we increment our current count. If we encounter a lowercase letter or a non-letter character, we compare the current count with the maximum count found so far and reset the current count to zero. At the end of the iteration, we need to check one last time to ensure we account for any uppercase sequence that might end at the last character of the string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function max_run_uppercase(s):\n       initialize max_count to 0\n       initialize current_count to 0\n       \n       for each character in s:\n           if character is uppercase:\n               increment current_count\n           else:\n               if current_count > max_count:\n                   update max_count\n               reset current_count to 0\n       \n       if current_count > max_count:\n           update max_count\n       \n       return max_count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef max_run_uppercase(s: str) -> int:\n    # Initialize the maximum count of uppercase letters found\n    max_count = 0\n    # Initialize the current count of consecutive uppercase letters\n    current_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the string\n    for char in s:\n        # Check if the character is uppercase\n        if char.isupper():\n            # Increment the current count\n            current_count += 1\n        else:\n            # If we encounter a lowercase letter, check if the current count is greater than max_count\n            if current_count > max_count:\n                max_count = current_count\n            # Reset the current count to 0\n            current_count = 0\n    \n    # Final check to update max_count in case the string ends with uppercase letters\n    if current_count > max_count:\n        max_count = current_count\n    \n    # Return the maximum count of consecutive uppercase letters found\n    return max_count\n```",
