This includes combinations of different lengths, starting from an empty combination to combinations that include all elements of the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To find all combinations, we can use a recursive approach. We can start with an empty combination and then iteratively add each element from the list to the current combination. For each element, we can either include it in the combination or exclude it, and we will continue this process until we have considered all elements. We will store each valid combination in a result list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function combinations_list(elements):\n       result = []\n       define a recursive function to generate combinations(current_combination, start_index):\n           add current_combination to result\n           for i from start_index to length of elements:\n               add elements[i] to current_combination\n               call recursive function with updated current_combination and i + 1\n               remove last element from current_combination (backtrack)\n       call recursive function with empty current_combination and start_index 0\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef combinations_list(elements):\n    result = []  # This will hold all the combinations\n\n    def generate_combinations(current_combination, start_index):\n        result.append(current_combination[:])  # Add a copy of the current combination to the result\n        for i in range(start_index, len(elements)):\n            current_combination.append(elements[i])  # Include the current element\n            generate_combinations(current_combination, i + 1)  # Recur with the next index\n            current_combination.pop()  # Backtrack to explore other combinations\n\n    generate_combinations([], 0)  # Start the recursion with an empty combination\n    return result  # Return the list of all combinations\n```"
