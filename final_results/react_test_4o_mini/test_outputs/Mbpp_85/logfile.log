You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/85 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the surface area of a sphere given its radius. The function should return the surface area as a floating-point number.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   The formula for the surface area of a sphere is given by the equation \( A = 4 \pi r^2 \), where \( A \) is the surface area and \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. We will use this formula in our function. We will also need to use the value of \( \pi \), which can be approximated as 3.141592653589793.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function named `surfacearea_sphere` that takes one parameter, `radius`.
   - Calculate the surface area using the formula \( A = 4 \times \pi \times (radius^2) \).
   - Return the calculated surface area.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:

# Define the function to calculate the surface area of a sphere

    pi = 3.141592653589793
    # Calculate the surface area using the formula A = 4 * pi * r^2
    surface_area = 4 * pi * (radius ** 2)
    # Return the calculated surface area
    return surface_area
