    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the surface area of a sphere given its radius. The function should return the surface area as a floating-point number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   The formula for the surface area of a sphere is given by the equation \\( A = 4 \\pi r^2 \\), where \\( A \\) is the surface area and \\( r \\) is the radius of the sphere. We will use this formula in our function. We will also need to use the value of \\( \\pi \\), which can be approximated as 3.141592653589793.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function named `surfacearea_sphere` that takes one parameter, `radius`.\n   - Calculate the surface area using the formula \\( A = 4 \\times \\pi \\times (radius^2) \\).\n   - Return the calculated surface area.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define the function to calculate the surface area of a sphere\ndef surfacearea_sphere(radius: float) -> float:\n    # Define the value of pi\n    pi = 3.141592653589793\n    # Calculate the surface area using the formula A = 4 * pi * r^2\n    surface_area = 4 * pi * (radius ** 2)\n    # Return the calculated surface area\n    return surface_area\n```",
