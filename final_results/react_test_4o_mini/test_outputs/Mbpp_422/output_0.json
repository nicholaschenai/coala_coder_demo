    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, we will calculate the cubes of 1 and 2, find their average, and return that value.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers, we can follow these steps:\n   - Initialize a variable to hold the sum of the cubes.\n   - Loop through the numbers from 1 to `n`, calculate the cube of each number, and add it to the sum.\n   - After the loop, divide the total sum by `n` to get the average.\n   - Return the average.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_Average_Of_Cube(n):\n       sum_of_cubes = 0\n       for i from 1 to n:\n           sum_of_cubes += i^3\n       average = sum_of_cubes / n\n       return average\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_Average_Of_Cube(n):\n    # Initialize a variable to hold the sum of cubes\n    sum_of_cubes = 0\n    \n    # Loop through the first n natural numbers\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the cube of the current number and add it to the sum\n        sum_of_cubes += i ** 3\n    \n    # Calculate the average by dividing the sum of cubes by n\n    average = sum_of_cubes / n\n    \n    # Return the calculated average\n    return average\n```",
