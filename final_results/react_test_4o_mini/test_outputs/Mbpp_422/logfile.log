You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/422 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, we will calculate the cubes of 1 and 2, find their average, and return that value.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers, we can follow these steps:
   - Initialize a variable to hold the sum of the cubes.
   - Loop through the numbers from 1 to `n`, calculate the cube of each number, and add it to the sum.
   - After the loop, divide the total sum by `n` to get the average.
   - Return the average.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_Average_Of_Cube(n):
       sum_of_cubes = 0
       for i from 1 to n:
           sum_of_cubes += i^3
       average = sum_of_cubes / n
       return average
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def find_Average_Of_Cube(n):
    # Initialize a variable to hold the sum of cubes
    sum_of_cubes = 0
    
    # Loop through the first n natural numbers
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Calculate the cube of the current number and add it to the sum
        sum_of_cubes += i ** 3
    
    # Calculate the average by dividing the sum of cubes by n
    average = sum_of_cubes / n
    
    # Return the calculated average
    return average
```
