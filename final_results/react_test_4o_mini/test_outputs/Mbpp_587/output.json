    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list as input and converts it into a tuple. The output should be a tuple containing the same elements as the input list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to define a function that accepts a list. Inside the function, we will use Python's built-in `tuple()` function to convert the list into a tuple. Finally, we will return the resulting tuple.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Define a function named list_tuple that takes one parameter (a list)\n       Convert the list to a tuple using the tuple() function\n       Return the tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function named list_tuple that takes a list as input\ndef list_tuple(lst):\n    # Convert the list to a tuple using the built-in tuple() function\n    result = tuple(lst)\n    # Return the resulting tuple\n    return result\n```",
