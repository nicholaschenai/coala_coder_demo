You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/587 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that takes a list as input and converts it into a tuple. The output should be a tuple containing the same elements as the input list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we need to define a function that accepts a list. Inside the function, we will use Python's built-in `tuple()` function to convert the list into a tuple. Finally, we will return the resulting tuple.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Define a function named list_tuple that takes one parameter (a list)
       Convert the list to a tuple using the tuple() function
       Return the tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function named list_tuple that takes a list as input
def list_tuple(lst):
    # Convert the list to a tuple using the built-in tuple() function
    result = tuple(lst)
    # Return the resulting tuple
    return result
```
