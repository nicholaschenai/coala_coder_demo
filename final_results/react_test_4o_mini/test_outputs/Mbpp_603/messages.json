A lucid number is defined as a positive integer that is not divisible by any prime number greater than itself.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To find all lucid numbers up to a given integer, we can iterate through each number from 1 to the specified integer. For each number, we will check if it is divisible by any prime number that is less than itself. If it is not divisible by any such prime, we will consider it a lucid number and add it to our result list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function get_ludic(n):\n       create an empty list called lucid_numbers\n       for each number i from 1 to n:\n           is_lucid = true\n           for each prime p less than i:\n               if i is divisible by p:\n                   is_lucid = false\n                   break\n           if is_lucid:\n               add i to lucid_numbers\n       return lucid_numbers\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef is_prime(num):\n    if num < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_primes_up_to(n):\n    primes = []\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        if is_prime(i):\n            primes.append(i)\n    return primes\n\ndef get_ludic(n):\n    # Create a list to hold the lucid numbers\n    lucid_numbers = []\n    \n    # Get all primes up to n\n    primes = get_primes_up_to(n)\n    \n    # Iterate through each number from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        is_lucid = True\n        \n        # Check divisibility by each prime less than i\n        for p in primes:\n            if p >= i:\n                break\n            if i % p == 0:\n                is_lucid = False\n                break\n        \n        # If the number is lucid, add it to the list\n        if is_lucid:\n            lucid_numbers.append(i)\n    \n    return lucid_numbers\n```"
