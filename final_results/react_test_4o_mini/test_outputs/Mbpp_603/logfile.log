You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/603 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that returns a list of all "lucid numbers" that are less than or equal to a specified integer. A lucid number is defined as a positive integer that is not divisible by any prime number greater than itself.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find all lucid numbers up to a given integer, we can iterate through each number from 1 to the specified integer. For each number, we will check if it is divisible by any prime number that is less than itself. If it is not divisible by any such prime, we will consider it a lucid number and add it to our result list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function get_ludic(n):
       create an empty list called lucid_numbers
       for each number i from 1 to n:
           is_lucid = true
           for each prime p less than i:
               if i is divisible by p:
                   is_lucid = false
                   break
           if is_lucid:
               add i to lucid_numbers
       return lucid_numbers
   ```
