You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list.
assert add_tuple([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/750 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list and a tuple as inputs and returns a new list that combines the original list with the elements of the tuple.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will define a function that accepts a list and a tuple. We will then convert the tuple into a list and concatenate it with the original list. Finally, we will return the new combined list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION add_tuple(list, tuple):
       CONVERT tuple to a list
       COMBINE the original list with the new list from the tuple
       RETURN the combined list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def add_tuple(lst, tpl):
    # Convert the tuple to a list
    tpl_as_list = list(tpl)
    # Combine the original list with the new list from the tuple
    combined_list = lst + tpl_as_list
    # Return the combined list
    return combined_list
