    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of items, where each item is represented as a dictionary containing a name and a price. The function should return the top 'n' most expensive items from this list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - Sort the list of items based on their price in descending order.\n   - Select the first 'n' items from the sorted list, as these will be the most expensive.\n   - Return this selection as the output.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function expensive_items(items, n):\n       sort items by price in descending order\n       select the first n items from the sorted list\n       return the selected items\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef expensive_items(items, n):\n    # Sort the items based on the price in descending order\n    sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda x: x['price'], reverse=True)\n    # Select the first n items from the sorted list\n    most_expensive = sorted_items[:n]\n    # Return the selected items\n    return most_expensive\n```",
