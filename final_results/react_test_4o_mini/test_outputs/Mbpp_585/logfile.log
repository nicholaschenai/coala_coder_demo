INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/585 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/585 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of items, where each item is represented as a dictionary containing a name and a price. The function should return the top 'n' most expensive items from this list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Sort the list of items based on their price in descending order.
   - Select the first 'n' items from the sorted list, as these will be the most expensive.
   - Return this selection as the output.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function expensive_items(items, n):
       sort items by price in descending order
       select the first n items from the sorted list
       return the selected items
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def expensive_items(items, n):
    # Sort the items based on the price in descending order
    sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda x: x['price'], reverse=True)
    # Select the first n items from the sorted list
    most_expensive = sorted_items[:n]
    # Return the selected items
    return most_expensive
