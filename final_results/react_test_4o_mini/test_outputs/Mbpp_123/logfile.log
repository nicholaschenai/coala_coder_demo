You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/123 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of all amicable numbers from 1 up to a given number (in this case, 999). Amicable numbers are two different numbers where each number is the sum of the proper divisors of the other.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Define a function to find the sum of proper divisors of a number.
   - Iterate through all numbers from 1 to the specified limit.
   - For each number, check if it forms an amicable pair with another number.
   - If it does, add both numbers to a set to avoid duplicates.
   - Finally, return the sum of all unique amicable numbers found.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sum_of_proper_divisors(n):
       sum = 0
       for i from 1 to n/2:
           if n is divisible by i:
               sum += i
       return sum

   function amicable_numbers_sum(limit):
       amicable_numbers = set()
       for num from 1 to limit:
           partner = sum_of_proper_divisors(num)
           if partner != num and sum_of_proper_divisors(partner) == num:
               amicable_numbers.add(num)
               amicable_numbers.add(partner)
       return sum(amicable_numbers)
   ```
