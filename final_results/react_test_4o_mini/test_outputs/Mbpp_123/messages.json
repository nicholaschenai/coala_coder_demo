Amicable numbers are two different numbers where each number is the sum of the proper divisors of the other.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Define a function to find the sum of proper divisors of a number.\n   - Iterate through all numbers from 1 to the specified limit.\n   - For each number, check if it forms an amicable pair with another number.\n   - If it does, add both numbers to a set to avoid duplicates.\n   - Finally, return the sum of all unique amicable numbers found.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function sum_of_proper_divisors(n):\n       sum = 0\n       for i from 1 to n/2:\n           if n is divisible by i:\n               sum += i\n       return sum\n\n   function amicable_numbers_sum(limit):\n       amicable_numbers = set()\n       for num from 1 to limit:\n           partner = sum_of_proper_divisors(num)\n           if partner != num and sum_of_proper_divisors(partner) == num:\n               amicable_numbers.add(num)\n               amicable_numbers.add(partner)\n       return sum(amicable_numbers)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef sum_of_proper_divisors(n):\n    # This function calculates the sum of proper divisors of n\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            total += i\n    return total\n\ndef amicable_numbers_sum(limit):\n    # This function finds all amicable numbers up to the specified limit and returns their sum\n    amicable_numbers = set()  # Use a set to avoid duplicates\n    for num in range(1, limit + 1):\n        partner = sum_of_proper_divisors(num)  # Find the sum of proper divisors\n        # Check if the partner is different and forms an amicable pair\n        if partner != num and sum_of_proper_divisors(partner) == num:\n            amicable_numbers.add(num)  # Add the first number\n            amicable_numbers.add(partner)  # Add the partner number\n    return sum(amicable_numbers)  # Return the sum of all unique amicable numbers\n```"
