You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
assert set(similar_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10))) == set((4, 5))

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/2 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes two lists (or tuples) as input and returns a new list (or tuple) containing only the elements that are present in both input lists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the shared elements between the two lists, we can iterate through one of the lists and check if each element is present in the other list. If it is, we will add it to a new list that will hold the shared elements. Finally, we will return this new list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function similar_elements(list1, list2):
       create an empty list called shared_elements
       for each element in list1:
           if element is in list2:
               add element to shared_elements
       return shared_elements
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def similar_elements(list1, list2):
    # Create an empty list to hold the shared elements
    shared_elements = []
    
    # Iterate through each element in the first list
    for element in list1:
        # Check if the element is in the second list
        if element in list2:
            # If it is, add it to the shared_elements list
            shared_elements.append(element)
    
    # Return the list of shared elements
    return shared_elements
