If it is, we will add it to a new list that will hold the shared elements. Finally, we will return this new list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function similar_elements(list1, list2):\n       create an empty list called shared_elements\n       for each element in list1:\n           if element is in list2:\n               add element to shared_elements\n       return shared_elements\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef similar_elements(list1, list2):\n    # Create an empty list to hold the shared elements\n    shared_elements = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the first list\n    for element in list1:\n        # Check if the element is in the second list\n        if element in list2:\n            # If it is, add it to the shared_elements list\n            shared_elements.append(element)\n    \n    # Return the list of shared elements\n    return shared_elements\n```"
