You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/129 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a given square matrix (2D list) is a magic square. A magic square is a grid where the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are all the same.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To determine if a matrix is a magic square, we will:
   - First, check if the matrix is square (the number of rows should equal the number of columns).
   - Calculate the sum of the first row, which will be our target sum.
   - Check if the sum of each row matches the target sum.
   - Check if the sum of each column matches the target sum.
   - Calculate the sums of the two main diagonals and check if they match the target sum.
   - If all these conditions are satisfied, the matrix is a magic square.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function magic_square_test(matrix):
       if matrix is not square:
           return False
       target_sum = sum of the first row
       for each row in matrix:
           if sum of row != target_sum:
               return False
       for each column in matrix:
           if sum of column != target_sum:
               return False
       diagonal1_sum = sum of the main diagonal
       diagonal2_sum = sum of the other diagonal
       if diagonal1_sum != target_sum or diagonal2_sum != target_sum:
           return False
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def magic_square_test(matrix):
    # Check if the matrix is square
