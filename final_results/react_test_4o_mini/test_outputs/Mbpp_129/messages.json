A magic square is a grid where the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are all the same.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To determine if a matrix is a magic square, we will:\n   - First, check if the matrix is square (the number of rows should equal the number of columns).\n   - Calculate the sum of the first row, which will be our target sum.\n   - Check if the sum of each row matches the target sum.\n   - Check if the sum of each column matches the target sum.\n   - Calculate the sums of the two main diagonals and check if they match the target sum.\n   - If all these conditions are satisfied, the matrix is a magic square.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function magic_square_test(matrix):\n       if matrix is not square:\n           return False\n       target_sum = sum of the first row\n       for each row in matrix:\n           if sum of row != target_sum:\n               return False\n       for each column in matrix:\n           if sum of column != target_sum:\n               return False\n       diagonal1_sum = sum of the main diagonal\n       diagonal2_sum = sum of the other diagonal\n       if diagonal1_sum != target_sum or diagonal2_sum != target_sum:\n           return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef magic_square_test(matrix):\n    # Check if the matrix is square\n    n = len(matrix)\n    if any(len(row) != n for row in matrix):\n        return False\n    \n    # Calculate the target sum from the first row\n    target_sum = sum(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Check the sum of each row\n    for row in matrix:\n        if sum(row) != target_sum:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check the sum of each column\n    for col in range(n):\n        if sum(matrix[row][col] for row in range(n)) != target_sum:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check the sum of the main diagonal\n    diagonal1_sum = sum(matrix[i][i] for i in range(n))\n    # Check the sum of the other diagonal\n    diagonal2_sum = sum(matrix[i][n - 1 - i] for i in range(n))\n    \n    # Check if both diagonal sums match the target sum\n    if diagonal1_sum != target_sum or diagonal2_sum != target_sum:\n        return False\n    \n    # If all checks passed, it is a magic square\n    return True\n```"
