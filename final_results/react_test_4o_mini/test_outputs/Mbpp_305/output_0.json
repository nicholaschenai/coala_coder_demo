    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of strings (words) and returns the first two words that start with the letter 'p'. If there are fewer than two such words, we should return only those that exist.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - We will iterate through each string in the list.\n   - For each string, we will split it into individual words.\n   - We will check if each word starts with the letter 'p'.\n   - We will collect the words that start with 'p' until we have two of them.\n   - Finally, we will return the collected words as a tuple.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function start_withp(words):\n       initialize an empty list to hold words starting with 'p'\n       for each string in words:\n           split the string into individual words\n           for each word in the split words:\n               if the word starts with 'p':\n                   add the word to the list\n                   if we have collected two words, return them as a tuple\n       return the collected words as a tuple (may be less than two)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef start_withp(words):\n    # Initialize an empty list to hold words starting with 'p'\n    p_words = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each string in the input list\n    for string in words:\n        # Split the string into individual words\n        for word in string.split():\n            # Check if the word starts with 'p'\n            if word.startswith('p'):\n                # Add the word to the list\n                p_words.append(word)\n                # If we have collected two words, return them as a tuple\n                if len(p_words) == 2:\n                    return (p_words[0], p_words[1])\n    \n    # Return the collected words as a tuple (may be less than two)\n    return tuple(p_words)\n\n```",
