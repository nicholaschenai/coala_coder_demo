You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/126 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes two integers as input and calculates the sum of all the common divisors of these two numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the common divisors of two numbers, we can:
   - Identify the smaller of the two numbers, as any common divisor must be less than or equal to this smaller number.
   - Loop through all integers from 1 to the smaller number and check if each integer divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.
   - If it does, we add that integer to a running total.
   - Finally, we return the total sum of these common divisors.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function sum(a, b):
       min_value = minimum of a and b
       total_sum = 0
       for i from 1 to min_value:
           if a % i == 0 and b % i == 0:
               total_sum += i
       return total_sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    # Determine the smaller of the two numbers
    min_value = min(a, b)

    total_sum = 0
    # Loop through all numbers from 1 to the smaller number
    for i in range(1, min_value + 1):
        # Check if i is a divisor of both a and b
        if a % i == 0 and b % i == 0:
            # If it is, add it to the total sum
            total_sum += i
    # Return the total sum of common divisors
