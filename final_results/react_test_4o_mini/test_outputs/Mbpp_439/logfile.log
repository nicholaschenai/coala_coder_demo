You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/439 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and combines them into a single integer. For example, if the input is a list containing the integers 11, 33, and 50, the output should be the integer 113350, which is formed by concatenating the numbers together.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can convert each integer in the list to a string, concatenate these string representations together, and then convert the resulting string back into an integer. This will give us the desired single integer output.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function multiple_to_single(integers):
       initialize an empty string result
       for each integer in integers:
           convert integer to string and append to result
       convert result string back to integer
       return the integer
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def multiple_to_single(integers):
    # Initialize an empty string to hold the concatenated result
    result = ""
    
    # Iterate through each integer in the input list
    for integer in integers:
        # Convert the integer to a string and append it to the result
        result += str(integer)
    
    # Convert the concatenated string back to an integer
    return int(result)
```

        # Convert the integer to a string and append it to the result
