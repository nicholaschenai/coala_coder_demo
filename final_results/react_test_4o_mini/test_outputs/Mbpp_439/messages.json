For example, if the input is a list containing the integers 11, 33, and 50, the output should be the integer 113350, which is formed by concatenating the numbers together.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can convert each integer in the list to a string, concatenate these string representations together, and then convert the resulting string back into an integer. This will give us the desired single integer output.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function multiple_to_single(integers):\n       initialize an empty string result\n       for each integer in integers:\n           convert integer to string and append to result\n       convert result string back to integer\n       return the integer\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef multiple_to_single(integers):\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the concatenated result\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate through each integer in the input list\n    for integer in integers:\n        # Convert the integer to a string and append it to the result\n        result += str(integer)\n    \n    # Convert the concatenated string back to an integer\n    return int(result)\n```"
