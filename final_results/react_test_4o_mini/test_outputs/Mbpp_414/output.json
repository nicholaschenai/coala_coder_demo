    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that checks if there are any common elements between two sequences (like lists). If there are common elements, the function should return `True`, and if there are none, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through one of the sequences and check if any of its elements exist in the other sequence. If we find a match, we return `True`. If we finish checking all elements without finding a match, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function overlapping(seq1, seq2):\n       for each element in seq1:\n           if element exists in seq2:\n               return True\n       return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a helper function to check if an element exists in a sequence\ndef exists_in_sequence(element, sequence):\n    for item in sequence:\n        if item == element:\n            return True\n    return False\n\n# Main function to check for overlapping values\ndef overlapping(seq1, seq2):\n    # Iterate through each element in the first sequence\n    for element in seq1:\n        # Check if the current element exists in the second sequence\n        if exists_in_sequence(element, seq2):\n            return True  # Return True if a match is found\n    return False  # Return False if no matches are found\n```",
