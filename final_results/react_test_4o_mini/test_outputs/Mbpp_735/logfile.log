You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to toggle bits of the number except the first and the last bit.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/735 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes an integer as input and toggles (flips) all the bits of that number except for the first and the last bits. The first bit is the most significant bit (leftmost), and the last bit is the least significant bit (rightmost).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Convert the integer to its binary representation.
   - Identify the first and last bits.
   - Toggle all the bits in between the first and last bits.
   - Convert the modified binary representation back to an integer and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function toggle_middle_bits(n):
       convert n to binary string
       if length of binary string is less than 3:
           return n (no middle bits to toggle)
       get the first bit
       get the last bit
       initialize an empty string for the new binary representation
       append the first bit to the new string
       for each middle bit:
           toggle the bit (0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0)
           append the toggled bit to the new string
       append the last bit to the new string
       convert the new binary string back to an integer
       return the new integer
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def toggle_middle_bits(n: int) -> int:
    # Convert the number to its binary representation
    binary_str = bin(n)[2:]  # Skip the '0b' prefix
