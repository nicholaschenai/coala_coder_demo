The first bit is the most significant bit (leftmost), and the last bit is the least significant bit (rightmost).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - Convert the integer to its binary representation.\n   - Identify the first and last bits.\n   - Toggle all the bits in between the first and last bits.\n   - Convert the modified binary representation back to an integer and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function toggle_middle_bits(n):\n       convert n to binary string\n       if length of binary string is less than 3:\n           return n (no middle bits to toggle)\n       get the first bit\n       get the last bit\n       initialize an empty string for the new binary representation\n       append the first bit to the new string\n       for each middle bit:\n           toggle the bit (0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0)\n           append the toggled bit to the new string\n       append the last bit to the new string\n       convert the new binary string back to an integer\n       return the new integer\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef toggle_middle_bits(n: int) -> int:\n    # Convert the number to its binary representation\n    binary_str = bin(n)[2:]  # Skip the '0b' prefix\n    \n    # If the length of the binary string is less than 3, return n\n    if len(binary_str) < 3:\n        return n\n    \n    # Get the first and last bits\n    first_bit = binary_str[0]\n    last_bit = binary_str[-1]\n    \n    # Initialize a new binary string with the first bit\n    new_binary_str = first_bit\n    \n    # Toggle the middle bits\n    for bit in binary_str[1:-1]:  # Exclude the first and last bits\n        if bit == '0':\n            new_binary_str += '1'  # Toggle 0 to 1\n        else:\n            new_binary_str += '0'  # Toggle 1 to 0\n    \n    # Append the last bit\n    new_binary_str += last_bit\n    \n    # Convert the new binary string back to an integer\n    return int(new_binary_str, 2)  # Base 2 conversion\n```"
