You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find whether all the given tuples have equal length or not.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/70 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if all the tuples in a given list have the same length. If they do, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - First, check if the list of tuples is empty. If it is, we can return `True` since there are no tuples to compare.
   - Next, we can determine the length of the first tuple and store it.
   - Then, we can iterate through the rest of the tuples in the list and compare their lengths to the length of the first tuple.
   - If we find any tuple that has a different length, we return `False`. If we finish checking all tuples without finding any differences, we return `True`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function get_equal(tuples):
       if tuples is empty:
           return True
       first_length = length of the first tuple
       for each tuple in tuples:
           if length of tuple is not equal to first_length:
               return False
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:

def get_equal(tuples):
    # Check if the list of tuples is empty
