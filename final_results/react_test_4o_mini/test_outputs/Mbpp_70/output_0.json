    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that checks if all the tuples in a given list have the same length. If they do, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - First, check if the list of tuples is empty. If it is, we can return `True` since there are no tuples to compare.\n   - Next, we can determine the length of the first tuple and store it.\n   - Then, we can iterate through the rest of the tuples in the list and compare their lengths to the length of the first tuple.\n   - If we find any tuple that has a different length, we return `False`. If we finish checking all tuples without finding any differences, we return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function get_equal(tuples):\n       if tuples is empty:\n           return True\n       first_length = length of the first tuple\n       for each tuple in tuples:\n           if length of tuple is not equal to first_length:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef get_equal(tuples):\n    # Check if the list of tuples is empty\n    if not tuples:\n        return True\n    \n    # Get the length of the first tuple\n    first_length = len(tuples[0])\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the list\n    for tup in tuples:\n        # Compare the length of the current tuple with the first tuple's length\n        if len(tup) != first_length:\n            return False  # Return False if any tuple has a different length\n    \n    return True  # Return True if all tuples have the same length\n```",
