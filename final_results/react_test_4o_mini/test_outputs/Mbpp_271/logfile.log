You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/271 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of the first `n` even natural numbers, each raised to the fifth power. For example, if `n` is 2, we should find the sum of the first two even natural numbers (2 and 4) raised to the fifth power.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Initialize a variable to hold the sum.
   - Use a loop to iterate from 1 to `n` to generate the first `n` even natural numbers. The `k`-th even natural number can be calculated as `2 * k`.
   - For each even number, raise it to the fifth power and add it to the sum.
   - Finally, return the computed sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function even_Power_Sum(n):
       sum = 0
       for i from 1 to n:
           even_number = 2 * i
           sum += even_number raised to the power of 5
       return sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def even_Power_Sum(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Loop through the first n natural numbers
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Calculate the i-th even natural number
        even_number = 2 * i
        # Raise the even number to the fifth power and add to sum
        sum += even_number ** 5
    # Return the final sum
    return sum
```
