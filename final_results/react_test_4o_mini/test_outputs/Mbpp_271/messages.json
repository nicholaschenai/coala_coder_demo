        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of the first `n` even natural numbers, each raised to the fifth power. For example, if `n` is 2, we should find the sum of the first two even natural numbers (2 and 4) raised to the fifth power.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - Initialize a variable to hold the sum.\n   - Use a loop to iterate from 1 to `n` to generate the first `n` even natural numbers. The `k`-th even natural number can be calculated as `2 * k`.\n   - For each even number, raise it to the fifth power and add it to the sum.\n   - Finally, return the computed sum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function even_Power_Sum(n):\n       sum = 0\n       for i from 1 to n:\n           even_number = 2 * i\n           sum += even_number raised to the power of 5\n       return sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef even_Power_Sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    sum = 0\n    # Loop through the first n natural numbers\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the i-th even natural number\n        even_number = 2 * i\n        # Raise the even number to the fifth power and add to sum\n        sum += even_number ** 5\n    # Return the final sum\n    return sum\n```"
