INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/808 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/808 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a specific number (k) is present in a given tuple of numbers. The function should return `True` if the number is found and `False` if it is not.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the elements of the tuple and check if any of the elements match the number k. If we find a match, we return `True`. If we finish checking all elements without finding a match, we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function check_K(tup, k):
       for each element in tup:
           if element is equal to k:
               return True
       return False
   ```

        # Check if the current element is equal to k

            return True  # Return True if k is found
    return False  # Return False if k is not found after checking all elements
