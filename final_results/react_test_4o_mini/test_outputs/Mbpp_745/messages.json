        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes two numbers, a starting number and an ending number. The function should return a list of numbers within that range where each number is divisible by each of its digits. For example, the number 12 is valid because both 1 and 2 divide it evenly.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate through each number in the range from the starting number to the ending number.\n   - For each number, we will convert it to a string to access its digits.\n   - We will check if each digit is not zero (to avoid division by zero) and if the number is divisible by that digit.\n   - If a number meets the criteria of being divisible by all its digits, we will add it to a result list.\n   - Finally, we will return the result list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):\n       create an empty list result\n       for each number in range from startnum to endnum:\n           convert number to string to access digits\n           set is_valid to True\n           for each digit in the string representation of the number:\n               if digit is '0':\n                   set is_valid to False\n                   break\n               if number modulo digit is not zero:\n                   set is_valid to False\n                   break\n           if is_valid is True:\n               add number to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef divisible_by_digits(startnum: int, endnum: int) -> list:\n    # Create an empty list to store valid numbers\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the specified range\n    for number in range(startnum, endnum + 1):\n        # Convert the number to a string to access its digits\n        str_number = str(number)\n        is_valid = True  # Assume the number is valid\n        \n        # Check each digit in the string representation of the number\n        for digit in str_number:\n            if digit == '0':  # Skip if the digit is zero\n                is_valid = False\n                break\n            if number % int(digit) != 0:  # Check divisibility\n                is_valid = False\n                break\n        \n        # If the number is valid, add it to the result list\n        if is_valid:\n            result.append(number)\n    \n    # Return the list of valid numbers\n    return result\n```"
