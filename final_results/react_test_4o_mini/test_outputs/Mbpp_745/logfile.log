You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/745 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes two numbers, a starting number and an ending number. The function should return a list of numbers within that range where each number is divisible by each of its digits. For example, the number 12 is valid because both 1 and 2 divide it evenly.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each number in the range from the starting number to the ending number.
   - For each number, we will convert it to a string to access its digits.
   - We will check if each digit is not zero (to avoid division by zero) and if the number is divisible by that digit.
   - If a number meets the criteria of being divisible by all its digits, we will add it to a result list.
   - Finally, we will return the result list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):
       create an empty list result
       for each number in range from startnum to endnum:
           convert number to string to access digits
           set is_valid to True
           for each digit in the string representation of the number:
               if digit is '0':
                   set is_valid to False
                   break
               if number modulo digit is not zero:
                   set is_valid to False
                   break
           if is_valid is True:
               add number to result
       return result
   ```
