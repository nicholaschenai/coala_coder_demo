You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find the number of elements that occurs before the tuple element in the given tuple.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/278 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that counts how many elements are present in a tuple before a specific element, which is itself a tuple. The function should return this count.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - We will iterate through the elements of the input tuple.
   - We will keep a count of the elements until we encounter the first tuple.
   - Once we find the tuple, we will return the count of the elements that were encountered before it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function count_first_elements(input_tuple):
       initialize count to 0
       for each element in input_tuple:
           if element is a tuple:
               return count
           increment count by 1
       return count (in case there is no tuple)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def count_first_elements(input_tuple):
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of elements
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each element in the input tuple
    for element in input_tuple:
        # Check if the current element is a tuple
        if isinstance(element, tuple):
            # If it is a tuple, return the current count
            return count
        # Increment the count for each non-tuple element
        count += 1
    
    # If no tuple is found, return the count (though this case shouldn't happen as per the problem statement)
    return count
