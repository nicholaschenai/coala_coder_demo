    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that counts how many elements are present in a tuple before a specific element, which is itself a tuple. The function should return this count.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - We will iterate through the elements of the input tuple.\n   - We will keep a count of the elements until we encounter the first tuple.\n   - Once we find the tuple, we will return the count of the elements that were encountered before it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_first_elements(input_tuple):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for each element in input_tuple:\n           if element is a tuple:\n               return count\n           increment count by 1\n       return count (in case there is no tuple)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_first_elements(input_tuple):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of elements\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the input tuple\n    for element in input_tuple:\n        # Check if the current element is a tuple\n        if isinstance(element, tuple):\n            # If it is a tuple, return the current count\n            return count\n        # Increment the count for each non-tuple element\n        count += 1\n    \n    # If no tuple is found, return the count (though this case shouldn't happen as per the problem statement)\n    return count\n```",
