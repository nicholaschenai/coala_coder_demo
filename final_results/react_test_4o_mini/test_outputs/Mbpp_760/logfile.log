You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to check whether a list of numbers contains only one distinct element or not.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/760 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if all the numbers in a given list are the same. If they are, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can check if the list has only one unique element. One way to do this is to compare each element in the list to the first element. If all elements are the same as the first one, we return `True`. If we find any element that is different, we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function unique_Element(numbers):
       if the list is empty:
           return False
       first_element = numbers[0]
       for each element in numbers:
           if element is not equal to first_element:
               return False
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def unique_Element(numbers):
    # Check if the list is empty
    if not numbers:
        return False  # An empty list does not have a distinct element
    
    # Store the first element of the list
    first_element = numbers[0]
    
    # Iterate through each element in the list
    for element in numbers:
        # If any element is not equal to the first element, return False
        if element != first_element:
            return False
    
    # If all elements are the same, return True
    return True
