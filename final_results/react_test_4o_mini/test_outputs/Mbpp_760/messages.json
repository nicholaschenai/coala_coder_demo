One way to do this is to compare each element in the list to the first element. If all elements are the same as the first one, we return `True`. If we find any element that is different, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function unique_Element(numbers):\n       if the list is empty:\n           return False\n       first_element = numbers[0]\n       for each element in numbers:\n           if element is not equal to first_element:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef unique_Element(numbers):\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if not numbers:\n        return False  # An empty list does not have a distinct element\n    \n    # Store the first element of the list\n    first_element = numbers[0]\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the list\n    for element in numbers:\n        # If any element is not equal to the first element, return False\n        if element != first_element:\n            return False\n    \n    # If all elements are the same, return True\n    return True\n```"
