    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that counts how many times specific elements from a list appear in a tuple. The function should take a tuple and a list as inputs and return the total count of occurrences of the list elements in the tuple.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each element in the list and check how many times that element appears in the tuple. We can maintain a count that accumulates the total occurrences for all elements in the list. Finally, we will return this count.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_Occurrence(tuple, list):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for each element in list:\n           count += count of element in tuple\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef count_Occurrence(tup, lst):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of occurrences\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the list\n    for element in lst:\n        # Count how many times the element appears in the tuple and add to count\n        count += tup.count(element)\n    \n    # Return the total count of occurrences\n    return count\n```",
