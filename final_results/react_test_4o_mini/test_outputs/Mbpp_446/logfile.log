You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
assert count_Occurrence(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'),['a', 'b'] ) == 3

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/446 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that counts how many times specific elements from a list appear in a tuple. The function should take a tuple and a list as inputs and return the total count of occurrences of the list elements in the tuple.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each element in the list and check how many times that element appears in the tuple. We can maintain a count that accumulates the total occurrences for all elements in the list. Finally, we will return this count.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_Occurrence(tuple, list):
       initialize count to 0
       for each element in list:
           count += count of element in tuple
       return count
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def count_Occurrence(tup, lst):
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of occurrences
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each element in the list
    for element in lst:
        # Count how many times the element appears in the tuple and add to count
        count += tup.count(element)
    
    # Return the total count of occurrences
    return count
```
