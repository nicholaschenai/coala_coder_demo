INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/398 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/398 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and calculates the sum of the digits for each integer in that list. Finally, we will return the total sum of all these digit sums.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each number in the list. For each number, we will convert it to a string to easily access each digit. We will then convert each character back to an integer and sum them up. We will keep a running total of these sums for all numbers in the list and return that total.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function sum_of_digits(numbers):
       initialize total_sum to 0
       for each number in numbers:
           convert number to string
           initialize digit_sum to 0
           for each character in string representation of number:
               convert character to integer and add to digit_sum
           add digit_sum to total_sum
       return total_sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def sum_of_digits(numbers):
    # Initialize the total sum to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate through each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # Convert the number to a string to access each digit
        digit_sum = 0
        for digit in str(number):
            # Convert each character back to an integer and sum them
            digit_sum += int(digit)
        
        # Add the sum of the digits of the current number to the total sum
        total_sum += digit_sum
    
    # Return the total sum of all digit sums
    return total_sum
