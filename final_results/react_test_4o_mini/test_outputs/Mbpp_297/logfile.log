You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/297 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list which may contain other lists (nested lists) and returns a single list with all the elements from the nested lists combined into one flat list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To flatten the list, we can iterate through each element of the input list. If an element is a list itself, we will need to go deeper into that list and extract its elements. If an element is not a list, we will simply add it to our result list. This process will continue recursively until all elements are extracted and combined into a single list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function flatten_list(nested_list):
       create an empty list called flat_list
       for each element in nested_list:
           if element is a list:
               call flatten_list recursively on element and extend flat_list with the result
           else:
               append element to flat_list
       return flat_list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:

def flatten_list(nested_list):
    # Create an empty list to hold the flattened result
    flat_list = []

            # If it is a list, recursively flatten it and extend the flat_list with the result
            flat_list.extend(flatten_list(element))
        else:
            # If it is not a list, append the element to flat_list
            flat_list.append(element)
    
    # Return the fully flattened list
