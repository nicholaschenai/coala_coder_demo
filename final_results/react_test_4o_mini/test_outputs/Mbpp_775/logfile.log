INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/775 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/775 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if all the numbers located at odd indices in a given list are also odd numbers. An index is considered odd if it is 1, 3, 5, etc.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through the list and check the elements at odd indices. For each of these elements, we will verify if they are odd. If we find any element at an odd index that is not odd, we will return `False`. If all elements at odd indices are odd, we will return `True`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function odd_position(lst):
       for index from 1 to length of lst - 1 with step 2:
           if lst[index] is not odd:
               return False
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def odd_position(lst):
    # Iterate through the list starting from index 1 to the end, stepping by 2 to get odd indices
    for index in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        # Check if the number at the current odd index is not odd
        if lst[index] % 2 == 0:  # If the number is even
            return False  # Return False if any even number is found at an odd index
    return True  # If all checks pass, return True
