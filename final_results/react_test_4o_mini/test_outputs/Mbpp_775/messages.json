An index is considered odd if it is 1, 3, 5, etc.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through the list and check the elements at odd indices. For each of these elements, we will verify if they are odd. If we find any element at an odd index that is not odd, we will return `False`. If all elements at odd indices are odd, we will return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function odd_position(lst):\n       for index from 1 to length of lst - 1 with step 2:\n           if lst[index] is not odd:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef odd_position(lst):\n    # Iterate through the list starting from index 1 to the end, stepping by 2 to get odd indices\n    for index in range(1, len(lst), 2):\n        # Check if the number at the current odd index is not odd\n        if lst[index] % 2 == 0:  # If the number is even\n            return False  # Return False if any even number is found at an odd index\n    return True  # If all checks pass, return True\n\n```"
