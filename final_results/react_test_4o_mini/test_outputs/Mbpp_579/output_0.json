    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple containing elements that are unique to each of the input tuples. In other words, we want to find elements that are present in one tuple but not in the other.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - Convert both tuples into sets to easily find unique elements.\n   - Use set operations to find elements that are in the first tuple but not in the second, and vice versa.\n   - Combine these unique elements into a single set.\n   - Convert the resulting set back into a tuple and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function find_dissimilar(tuple1, tuple2):\n       convert tuple1 to set1\n       convert tuple2 to set2\n       find unique elements in set1 not in set2\n       find unique elements in set2 not in set1\n       combine these unique elements into a new set\n       convert the new set to a tuple\n       return the tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef find_dissimilar(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Convert the input tuples to sets for easier manipulation\n    set1 = set(tuple1)\n    set2 = set(tuple2)\n    \n    # Find elements that are in set1 but not in set2\n    unique_to_set1 = set1 - set2\n    \n    # Find elements that are in set2 but not in set1\n    unique_to_set2 = set2 - set1\n    \n    # Combine the unique elements from both sets\n    dissimilar_elements = unique_to_set1.union(unique_to_set2)\n    \n    # Convert the resulting set back to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(dissimilar_elements)\n```",
