INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/579 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple containing elements that are unique to each of the input tuples. In other words, we want to find elements that are present in one tuple but not in the other.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Convert both tuples into sets to easily find unique elements.
   - Use set operations to find elements that are in the first tuple but not in the second, and vice versa.
   - Combine these unique elements into a single set.
   - Convert the resulting set back into a tuple and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_dissimilar(tuple1, tuple2):
       convert tuple1 to set1
       convert tuple2 to set2
       find unique elements in set1 not in set2
       find unique elements in set2 not in set1

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/579 [generation text] Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Output Issue:**
   The output of the function `find_dissimilar((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10))` is `(10, 3, 6, 7)`, which is not equal to the expected output `(3, 6, 7, 10)`. The discrepancy arises from the fact that sets in Python do not maintain the order of elements. Therefore, when we convert the set back to a tuple, the order of elements may not match the expected order.

2. **Identifying the Mistake:**
   The mistake in the previous solution is that while we correctly identified the unique elements, we did not consider the order of the elements in the final output. The expected output is a tuple that maintains the order of the unique elements as they appear in the original tuples.

3. **Correcting the Approach:**
   To fix this, we need to:
   - Iterate through the original tuples and collect elements that are unique to each tuple while maintaining their order.
   - We can use a list to store the unique elements and then convert that list to a tuple before returning it.

Now, let's implement this corrected approach in the code. 

```python
def find_dissimilar(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Convert the input tuples to sets for easy lookup
    set1 = set(tuple1)
    set2 = set(tuple2)
    
    # Initialize a list to collect dissimilar elements
    dissimilar_elements = []
    
    # Iterate through the first tuple and add unique elements to the list
    for element in tuple1:
        if element not in set2:
            dissimilar_elements.append(element)
    
    # Iterate through the second tuple and add unique elements to the list
    for element in tuple2:
        if element not in set1:
            dissimilar_elements.append(element)
    
    # Convert the list of dissimilar elements to a tuple and return it
    return tuple(dissimilar_elements)
