You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/239 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that counts how many different sequences of a specified length (n) can be formed using positive integers. Each integer in the sequence must be at least double the previous integer and cannot exceed a given maximum value (m).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. Starting from the first element of the sequence, we can generate the next elements by ensuring they are at least double the previous element and do not exceed the maximum value (m). We will keep track of the current length of the sequence and count how many valid sequences we can form until we reach the desired length (n).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_sequences(current_value, current_length):
       if current_length == n:
           return 1  // Found a valid sequence
       count = 0
       next_value = 2 * current_value
       while next_value <= m:
           count += count_sequences(next_value, current_length + 1)
           next_value += 1  // Increment to check the next possible value
       return count

   function get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):
       total_count = 0
       for starting_value in range(1, m + 1):
           total_count += count_sequences(starting_value, 1)
       return total_count
   ```

def count_sequences(current_value, current_length, m, n):
