        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that counts how many different sequences of a specified length (n) can be formed using positive integers. Each integer in the sequence must be at least double the previous integer and cannot exceed a given maximum value (m).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. Starting from the first element of the sequence, we can generate the next elements by ensuring they are at least double the previous element and do not exceed the maximum value (m). We will keep track of the current length of the sequence and count how many valid sequences we can form until we reach the desired length (n).\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_sequences(current_value, current_length):\n       if current_length == n:\n           return 1  // Found a valid sequence\n       count = 0\n       next_value = 2 * current_value\n       while next_value <= m:\n           count += count_sequences(next_value, current_length + 1)\n           next_value += 1  // Increment to check the next possible value\n       return count\n\n   function get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):\n       total_count = 0\n       for starting_value in range(1, m + 1):\n           total_count += count_sequences(starting_value, 1)\n       return total_count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef count_sequences(current_value, current_length, m, n):\n    # Base case: if the current length equals n, we found a valid sequence\n    if current_length == n:\n        return 1\n    \n    count = 0\n    # Calculate the next possible value which is at least double the current value\n    next_value = 2 * current_value\n    \n    # Loop to find all valid next values that are less than or equal to m\n    while next_value <= m:\n        # Recursively count sequences starting from the next value\n        count += count_sequences(next_value, current_length + 1, m, n)\n        next_value += 1  # Increment to check the next possible value\n    \n    return count\n\ndef get_total_number_of_sequences(m: int, n: int) -> int:\n    total_count = 0\n    # Start the sequence with each possible starting value from 1 to m\n    for starting_value in range(1, m + 1):\n        total_count += count_sequences(starting_value, 1, m, n)\n    return total_count\n```"
