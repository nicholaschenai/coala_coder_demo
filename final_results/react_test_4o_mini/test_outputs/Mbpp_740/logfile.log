You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to convert the given tuple to a key-value dictionary using adjacent elements.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/740 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a tuple of numbers and converts it into a dictionary. The dictionary should use pairs of adjacent elements from the tuple as key-value pairs. The first element of the pair will be the key, and the second element will be the value.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through the tuple in steps of two. For each pair of elements, we will take the first element as the key and the second element as the value and add them to a dictionary. If the tuple has an odd number of elements, the last element will be ignored since it does not have a pair.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function tuple_to_dict(input_tuple):
       create an empty dictionary
       for i from 0 to length of input_tuple with step 2:
           if i + 1 is less than length of input_tuple:
               key = input_tuple[i]
               value = input_tuple[i + 1]
               add key-value pair to the dictionary
       return the dictionary
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def tuple_to_dict(input_tuple):
    # Create an empty dictionary to store the key-value pairs
    result_dict = {}
    
    # Iterate through the tuple in steps of 2
    for i in range(0, len(input_tuple), 2):
        # Check if there is a next element to form a key-value pair
        if i + 1 < len(input_tuple):
            key = input_tuple[i]        # First element as key
            value = input_tuple[i + 1]  # Second element as value
            result_dict[key] = value    # Add to the dictionary
    
    # Return the constructed dictionary
    return result_dict
