INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/788 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to create a new tuple from the given string and list.
assert new_tuple(["WEB", "is"], "best") == ('WEB', 'is', 'best')

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/788 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of strings and a single string as input, and returns a new tuple that combines all the elements of the list with the single string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will take the list of strings and the single string, and combine them into a tuple. A tuple is similar to a list but is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed after it is created. We will use the built-in `tuple()` function to convert the list into a tuple and then add the single string to it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Function new_tuple(input_list, input_string):
       Convert input_list to a tuple
       Create a new tuple that includes all elements of the converted tuple and input_string
       Return the new tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def new_tuple(input_list, input_string):
    # Convert the input list to a tuple
    tuple_from_list = tuple(input_list)
    # Create a new tuple that includes all elements of the converted tuple and the input string
    result_tuple = tuple_from_list + (input_string,)
    # Return the new tuple
    return result_tuple
```
