A tuple is similar to a list but is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed after it is created. We will use the built-in `tuple()` function to convert the list into a tuple and then add the single string to it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Function new_tuple(input_list, input_string):\n       Convert input_list to a tuple\n       Create a new tuple that includes all elements of the converted tuple and input_string\n       Return the new tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef new_tuple(input_list, input_string):\n    # Convert the input list to a tuple\n    tuple_from_list = tuple(input_list)\n    # Create a new tuple that includes all elements of the converted tuple and the input string\n    result_tuple = tuple_from_list + (input_string,)\n    # Return the new tuple\n    return result_tuple\n```"
