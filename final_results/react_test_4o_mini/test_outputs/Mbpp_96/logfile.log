INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/96 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/96 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes an integer as input and returns the count of its divisors. A divisor of a number is any integer that can divide that number without leaving a remainder.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the number of divisors of a given integer, we can iterate through all integers from 1 to that number. For each integer, we check if it divides the given number evenly (i.e., the remainder when dividing the number by this integer is zero). We will keep a count of how many integers satisfy this condition.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function divisor(n):
       initialize count to 0
       for i from 1 to n:
           if n mod i equals 0:
               increment count
       return count
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def divisor(n):
    # Initialize a count variable to keep track of the number of divisors
    count = 0
    # Loop through all integers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Check if i is a divisor of n
        if n % i == 0:
            # If it is, increment the count
            count += 1
    # Return the total count of divisors
    return count
