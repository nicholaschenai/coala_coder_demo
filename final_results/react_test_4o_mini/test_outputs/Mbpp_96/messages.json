A divisor of a number is any integer that can divide that number without leaving a remainder.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the number of divisors of a given integer, we can iterate through all integers from 1 to that number.

We will keep a count of how many integers satisfy this condition.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function divisor(n):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for i from 1 to n:\n           if n mod i equals 0:\n               increment count\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef divisor(n):\n    # Initialize a count variable to keep track of the number of divisors\n    count = 0\n    # Loop through all integers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Check if i is a divisor of n\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # If it is, increment the count\n            count += 1\n    # Return the total count of divisors\n    return count\n```"
