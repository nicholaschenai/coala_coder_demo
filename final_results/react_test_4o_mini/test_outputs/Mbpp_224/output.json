    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The task is to create a function that counts how many bits are set to 1 in the binary representation of a given integer.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can convert the given integer into its binary form and then count the number of '1's in that representation. We can achieve this by repeatedly checking the least significant bit of the number and shifting the number to the right until it becomes zero. Each time we find a '1', we increment a counter.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_Set_Bits(n):\n       initialize count to 0\n       while n is greater than 0:\n           if n AND 1 is equal to 1:\n               increment count\n           right shift n by 1\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef count_Set_Bits(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of set bits\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Loop until n becomes 0\n    while n > 0:\n        # Check if the least significant bit is 1\n        if n & 1 == 1:\n            count += 1  # Increment the count if it is 1\n        \n        # Right shift n by 1 to check the next bit\n        n >>= 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of set bits\n    return count\n```",
