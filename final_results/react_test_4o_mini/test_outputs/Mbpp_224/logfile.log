INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/224 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to count the number of set bits (binary digits with value 1) in a given number.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/224 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that counts how many bits are set to 1 in the binary representation of a given integer.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can convert the given integer into its binary form and then count the number of '1's in that representation. We can achieve this by repeatedly checking the least significant bit of the number and shifting the number to the right until it becomes zero. Each time we find a '1', we increment a counter.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_Set_Bits(n):
       initialize count to 0
       while n is greater than 0:
           if n AND 1 is equal to 1:
               increment count
           right shift n by 1
       return count
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def count_Set_Bits(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of set bits
    count = 0
    
    # Loop until n becomes 0
    while n > 0:
        # Check if the least significant bit is 1
        if n & 1 == 1:
            count += 1  # Increment the count if it is 1
        
        # Right shift n by 1 to check the next bit
        n >>= 1
    
    # Return the total count of set bits
    return count
```
