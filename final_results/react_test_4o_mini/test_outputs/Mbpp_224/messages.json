We can achieve this by repeatedly checking the least significant bit of the number and shifting the number to the right until it becomes zero. Each time we find a '1', we increment a counter.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_Set_Bits(n):\n       initialize count to 0\n       while n is greater than 0:\n           if n AND 1 is equal to 1:\n               increment count\n           right shift n by 1\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef count_Set_Bits(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of set bits\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Loop until n becomes 0\n    while n > 0:\n        # Check if the least significant bit is 1\n        if n & 1 == 1:\n            count += 1  # Increment the count if it is 1\n        \n        # Right shift n by 1 to check the next bit\n        n >>= 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of set bits\n    return count\n```"
