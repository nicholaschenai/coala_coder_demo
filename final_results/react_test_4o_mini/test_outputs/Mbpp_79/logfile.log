INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/79 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/79 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if the length of a given word is odd. If the length is odd, the function should return `True`, and if it is even, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Take a word as input.
   - Calculate the length of the word.
   - Check if the length is odd or even.
   - Return `True` if the length is odd and `False` if it is even.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION word_len(word):
       SET length = LENGTH of word
       IF length MOD 2 is NOT EQUAL to 0 THEN
           RETURN True
       ELSE
           RETURN False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:

# Define a function to check if the length of a word is odd
def word_len(word: str) -> bool:
    # Calculate the length of the word
    length = len(word)
    # Check if the length is odd
    if length % 2 != 0:
        return True  # Return True if the length is odd
    else:
        return False  # Return False if the length is even
