INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/124 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the angle (or argument) of a complex number. The angle should be returned in radians. The function should be able to handle complex numbers represented in Python, such as `1j` for the imaginary unit.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   The angle of a complex number can be calculated using the arctangent function. For a complex number represented as `a + bj`, where `a` is the real part and `b` is the imaginary part, the angle can be found using the formula `atan2(b, a)`. This function takes into account the signs of both parts to determine the correct quadrant of the angle.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:

   Define a function angle_complex(real: float, imag: float) -> float:
       Return the angle using atan2(imag, real)

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/124 [generation text] 1. **Step-by-step analysis of why the code is wrong**:
   - The function `angle_complex` is designed to take two parameters: `real` and `imag`. However, the test case `angle_complex(0, 1j)` is passing a complex number `1j` as the second argument instead of a real number.
   - The function is not set up to handle complex numbers directly; it expects two separate float values for the real and imaginary parts.
   - The test case is likely intended to represent the complex number `0 + 1j`, but the way it is called does not match the expected input types.

2. **Step-by-step analysis of where I went wrong**:
   - I did not account for the fact that the input could be a complex number directly. Instead, I assumed that the function would receive two separate float values.
   - The function should be modified to accept a single complex number as input and then extract its real and imaginary parts to compute the angle.

To fix the issue, I will modify the function to accept a single complex number and then calculate the angle using its real and imaginary components. 

Hereâ€™s the revised plan:
- Define the function to take a single complex number as input.
- Extract the real and imaginary parts from the complex number.
- Use `math.atan2` to compute the angle based on these parts.

Now, I will implement the corrected solution.

   - The test case is likely intended to represent the complex number `0 + 1j`, but the way it is called does not match the expected input types.

2. **Step-by-step analysis of where I went wrong**:
   - I did not account for the fact that the input could be a complex number directly. Instead, I assumed that the function would receive two separate float values.
   - The function should be modified to accept a single complex number as input and then extract its real and imaginary parts to compute the angle.

To fix the issue, I will modify the function to accept a single complex number and then calculate the angle using its real and imaginary components. 

Hereâ€™s the revised plan:
- Define the function to take a single complex number as input.
- Extract the real and imaginary parts from the complex number.
- Use `math.atan2` to compute the angle based on these parts.

Now, I will implement the corrected solution.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/124 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the angle (or argument) of a complex number. The angle should be returned in radians. The function should be able to handle complex numbers represented in Python, such as `1j` for the imaginary unit.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   The angle of a complex number can be calculated using the arctangent function. For a complex number represented as `a + bj`, where `a` is the real part and `b` is the imaginary part, the angle can be found using the formula `atan2(b, a)`. This function takes into account the signs of both parts to determine the correct quadrant of the angle.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Define a function angle_complex(real: float, imag: float) -> float:
       Return the angle using atan2(imag, real)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python

# Define a function to calculate the angle of a complex number

    # Use the atan2 function to calculate the angle in radians

INFO - program_name:
 angle_complex

INFO - dependencies:
 []

INFO - raw_msg:
 ```python
import math

# Define a function to calculate the angle of a complex number
def angle_complex(real: float, imag: float) -> float:
    # Use the atan2 function to calculate the angle in radians
    return math.atan2(imag, real)

# Since the test case is passing a complex number, we need to adjust the function to accept a complex number directly.
def angle_complex(z: complex) -> float:
    # Extract the real and imaginary parts from the complex number
    real = z.real
    imag = z.imag
    # Use the atan2 function to calculate the angle in radians
    return math.atan2(imag, real)
``` 

However, since the function name must remain the same, I will keep the first definition and remove the second one. 

Hereâ€™s the final implementation:

```python
import math

# Define a function to calculate the angle of a complex number
def angle_complex(z: complex) -> float:
    # Extract the real and imaginary parts from the complex number
    real = z.real
    imag = z.imag
    # Use the atan2 function to calculate the angle in radians
    return math.atan2(imag, real)
``` 

This will ensure that the function can handle the input correctly.
