The angle should be returned in radians. The function should be able to handle complex numbers represented in Python, such as `1j` for the imaginary unit.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   The angle of a complex number can be calculated using the arctangent function. For a complex number represented as `a + bj`, where `a` is the real part and `b` is the imaginary part, the angle can be found using the formula `atan2(b, a)`. This function takes into account the signs of both parts to determine the correct quadrant of the angle.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Define a function angle_complex(real: float, imag: float) -> float:\n       Return the angle using atan2(imag, real)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define a function to calculate the angle of a complex number\ndef angle_complex(real: float, imag: float) -> float:\n    # Use the atan2 function to calculate the angle in radians\n    return math.atan2(imag, real)\n```"
