    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes three lists as input and counts how many times the elements in the same positions of these lists are identical.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through the three lists simultaneously, comparing the elements at each index. For each index, if the elements from all three lists are the same, we will increase a counter. Finally, we will return the count of identical items.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_samepair(list1, list2, list3):\n       initialize a counter to 0\n       for each index from 0 to the length of the lists:\n           if list1[index] is equal to list2[index] and list1[index] is equal to list3[index]:\n               increment the counter\n       return the counter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef count_samepair(list1, list2, list3):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of identical items\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the indices of the lists\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        # Check if the elements at the current index are the same in all three lists\n        if list1[i] == list2[i] == list3[i]:\n            # Increment the counter if they are identical\n            count += 1\n            \n    # Return the total count of identical items\n    return count\n```",
