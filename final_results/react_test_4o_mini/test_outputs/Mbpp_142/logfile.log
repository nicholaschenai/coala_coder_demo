You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/142 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes three lists as input and counts how many times the elements in the same positions of these lists are identical.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through the three lists simultaneously, comparing the elements at each index. For each index, if the elements from all three lists are the same, we will increase a counter. Finally, we will return the count of identical items.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_samepair(list1, list2, list3):
       initialize a counter to 0
       for each index from 0 to the length of the lists:
           if list1[index] is equal to list2[index] and list1[index] is equal to list3[index]:
               increment the counter
       return the counter
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def count_samepair(list1, list2, list3):
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of identical items
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through the indices of the lists
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        # Check if the elements at the current index are the same in all three lists
        if list1[i] == list2[i] == list3[i]:
            # Increment the counter if they are identical
            count += 1
            
    # Return the total count of identical items
    return count
```
