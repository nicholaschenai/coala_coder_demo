You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/71 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function named `comb_sort` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with those numbers sorted in ascending order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To sort the list, we can use the Comb Sort algorithm, which is an improvement over the traditional Bubble Sort. The idea is to compare elements that are far apart and gradually reduce the gap between them. This helps to move larger elements towards the end of the list more quickly. The process continues until the list is sorted.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function comb_sort(arr):
       set gap to length of arr divided by 1.3
       set swapped to true
       while gap > 1 or swapped is true:
           if gap < 1:
               set gap to 1
           set swapped to false
           for i from 0 to length of arr - gap:
               if arr[i] > arr[i + gap]:
                   swap arr[i] and arr[i + gap]
                   set swapped to true
   return arr
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def comb_sort(arr):
    # Initialize the gap size
    gap = len(arr)
    # Set a flag to indicate if a swap has occurred
    swapped = True
    
    # Continue sorting until the gap is reduced to 1 and no swaps are made
    while gap > 1 or swapped:
        # Update the gap size
        gap = max(1, int(gap / 1.3))
        swapped = False
        
        # Compare elements with the current gap
        for i in range(len(arr) - gap):
            if arr[i] > arr[i + gap]:
                # Swap the elements if they are in the wrong order
                arr[i], arr[i + gap] = arr[i + gap], arr[i]
                swapped = True
