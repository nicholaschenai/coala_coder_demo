    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The task is to create a function named `comb_sort` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with those numbers sorted in ascending order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To sort the list, we can use the Comb Sort algorithm, which is an improvement over the traditional Bubble Sort. The idea is to compare elements that are far apart and gradually reduce the gap between them. This helps to move larger elements towards the end of the list more quickly. The process continues until the list is sorted.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function comb_sort(arr):\n       set gap to length of arr divided by 1.3\n       set swapped to true\n       while gap > 1 or swapped is true:\n           if gap < 1:\n               set gap to 1\n           set swapped to false\n           for i from 0 to length of arr - gap:\n               if arr[i] > arr[i + gap]:\n                   swap arr[i] and arr[i + gap]\n                   set swapped to true\n   return arr\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef comb_sort(arr):\n    # Initialize the gap size\n    gap = len(arr)\n    # Set a flag to indicate if a swap has occurred\n    swapped = True\n    \n    # Continue sorting until the gap is reduced to 1 and no swaps are made\n    while gap > 1 or swapped:\n        # Update the gap size\n        gap = max(1, int(gap / 1.3))\n        swapped = False\n        \n        # Compare elements with the current gap\n        for i in range(len(arr) - gap):\n            if arr[i] > arr[i + gap]:\n                # Swap the elements if they are in the wrong order\n                arr[i], arr[i + gap] = arr[i + gap], arr[i]\n                swapped = True\n                \n    return arr\n```",
