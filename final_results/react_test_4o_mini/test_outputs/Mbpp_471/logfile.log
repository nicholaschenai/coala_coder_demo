You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to find the product of the array multiplication modulo n.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/471 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and a number `n`, then calculates the product of all the integers in the list. Finally, we return the result of that product modulo `n`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Start with a variable to hold the product, initialized to 1 (since multiplying by 1 does not change the product).
   - Loop through each number in the input list and multiply it to the product variable.
   - After calculating the total product, take the result modulo `n` to get the final answer.
   - Return this final result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_remainder(array, n):
       product = 1
       for each number in array:
           product = product * number
       return product % n
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def find_remainder(array, n):
    # Initialize the product variable to 1
    product = 1
    
    # Loop through each number in the input array
    for number in array:
        # Multiply the current number to the product
        product *= number
    
    # Return the product modulo n
    return product % n
