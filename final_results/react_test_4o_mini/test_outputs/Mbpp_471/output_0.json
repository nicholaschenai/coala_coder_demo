    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and a number `n`, then calculates the product of all the integers in the list. Finally, we return the result of that product modulo `n`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - Start with a variable to hold the product, initialized to 1 (since multiplying by 1 does not change the product).\n   - Loop through each number in the input list and multiply it to the product variable.\n   - After calculating the total product, take the result modulo `n` to get the final answer.\n   - Return this final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function find_remainder(array, n):\n       product = 1\n       for each number in array:\n           product = product * number\n       return product % n\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef find_remainder(array, n):\n    # Initialize the product variable to 1\n    product = 1\n    \n    # Loop through each number in the input array\n    for number in array:\n        # Multiply the current number to the product\n        product *= number\n    \n    # Return the product modulo n\n    return product % n\n```",
