    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and removes all the odd numbers from it, returning a new list that only contains the even numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each number in the input list. For each number, we will check if it is even (i.e., divisible by 2). If it is even, we will add it to a new list. Finally, we will return this new list containing only the even numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function remove_odd(numbers):\n       create an empty list called even_numbers\n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is even:\n               add number to even_numbers\n       return even_numbers\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef remove_odd(numbers):\n    # Create an empty list to store even numbers\n    even_numbers = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the input list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is even\n        if number % 2 == 0:\n            # If it is even, add it to the even_numbers list\n            even_numbers.append(number)\n    \n    # Return the list of even numbers\n    return even_numbers\n```",
