You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to count the number of sublists containing a particular element.
assert count_element_in_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 11], [1, 15, 7]],1)==3

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/425 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that counts how many sublists (lists within a list) contain a specific element. For example, if we have a list of lists and we want to count how many of those lists contain the number 1, we should return that count.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each sublist in the main list. For each sublist, we will check if the specific element is present. If it is, we will increase our count by one. Finally, we will return the total count of sublists that contain the element.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function count_element_in_list(sublists, element):
       initialize count to 0
       for each sublist in sublists:
           if element is in sublist:
               increment count by 1
       return count
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def count_element_in_list(sublists, element):
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of sublists containing the element
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each sublist in the provided list of sublists
    for sublist in sublists:
        # Check if the specified element is present in the current sublist
        if element in sublist:
            # If it is, increment the count
            count += 1
            
    # Return the total count of sublists containing the element
    return count
