    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that counts how many sublists (lists within a list) contain a specific element. For example, if we have a list of lists and we want to count how many of those lists contain the number 1, we should return that count.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each sublist in the main list. For each sublist, we will check if the specific element is present. If it is, we will increase our count by one. Finally, we will return the total count of sublists that contain the element.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_element_in_list(sublists, element):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for each sublist in sublists:\n           if element is in sublist:\n               increment count by 1\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_element_in_list(sublists, element):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of sublists containing the element\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the provided list of sublists\n    for sublist in sublists:\n        # Check if the specified element is present in the current sublist\n        if element in sublist:\n            # If it is, increment the count\n            count += 1\n            \n    # Return the total count of sublists containing the element\n    return count\n```",
