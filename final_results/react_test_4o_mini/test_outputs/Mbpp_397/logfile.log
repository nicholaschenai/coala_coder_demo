You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/397 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the median of those three numbers. The median is the middle value when the numbers are sorted.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the median of three numbers, we can sort the three numbers and then select the second number from the sorted list, as it will be the median. 

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function named `median_numbers` that takes three parameters.
   - Create a list containing the three numbers.
   - Sort the list.
   - Return the second element of the sorted list (which is the median).

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def median_numbers(a: float, b: float, c: float) -> float:
    # Create a list of the three numbers
    numbers = [a, b, c]
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()
    # Return the second element, which is the median
    return numbers[1]
```
