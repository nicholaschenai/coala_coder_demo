You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to find the first repeated character in a given string.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/602 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns the first character that appears more than once in that string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string while keeping track of the characters we have already seen. We can use a set to store these characters. As we go through the string, if we encounter a character that is already in the set, we return that character as it is the first repeated one. If we finish checking all characters without finding a repeat, we can return None or an indication that there is no repeated character.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function first_repeated_char(string):
       create an empty set called seen_characters
       for each character in string:
           if character is in seen_characters:
               return character
           add character to seen_characters
       return None
   ```

def first_repeated_char(string: str) -> str:
    # Create an empty set to keep track of seen characters

        if char in seen_characters:
            return char
        # Add the character to the set of seen characters
        seen_characters.add(char)
    
    # If no repeated character is found, return None
    return None
