    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns the first character that appears more than once in that string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string while keeping track of the characters we have already seen. We can use a set to store these characters. As we go through the string, if we encounter a character that is already in the set, we return that character as it is the first repeated one. If we finish checking all characters without finding a repeat, we can return None or an indication that there is no repeated character.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function first_repeated_char(string):\n       create an empty set called seen_characters\n       for each character in string:\n           if character is in seen_characters:\n               return character\n           add character to seen_characters\n       return None\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef first_repeated_char(string: str) -> str:\n    # Create an empty set to keep track of seen characters\n    seen_characters = set()\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the input string\n    for char in string:\n        # If the character is already in the set, it is the first repeated character\n        if char in seen_characters:\n            return char\n        # Add the character to the set of seen characters\n        seen_characters.add(char)\n    \n    # If no repeated character is found, return None\n    return None\n```",
