INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/421 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to concatenate each element of tuple by the delimiter.
assert concatenate_tuple(("ID", "is", 4, "UTS") ) == 'ID-is-4-UTS'

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/421 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a tuple containing various elements (strings and integers) and concatenates them into a single string, with each element separated by a hyphen ("-").

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - We will define a function that accepts a tuple as an argument.
   - We will convert each element of the tuple to a string (since the tuple can contain integers).
   - We will then join these string elements together using a hyphen as the delimiter.
   - Finally, we will return the resulting concatenated string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION concatenate_tuple(input_tuple):
       CONVERT each element of input_tuple to string
       JOIN the string elements with "-" as the delimiter
       RETURN the concatenated string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def concatenate_tuple(input_tuple):
    # Convert each element of the tuple to a string
    string_elements = [str(element) for element in input_tuple]
    # Join the string elements with "-" as the delimiter
    result = "-".join(string_elements)
    # Return the concatenated string
    return result
