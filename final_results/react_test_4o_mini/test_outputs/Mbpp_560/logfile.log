You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find the union of the elements of two given tuples and output them in sorted order.
assert union_elements((3, 4, 5, 6),(5, 7, 4, 10) ) == (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10)

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/560 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes two tuples as input. The function should find all unique elements from both tuples, combine them, and return them in a sorted order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - First, we will combine the two tuples into one collection.
   - Next, we will remove any duplicate elements to ensure all elements are unique.
   - Finally, we will sort the unique elements and return them as a new tuple.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function union_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
       combine tuple1 and tuple2 into a single collection
       remove duplicates from the combined collection
       sort the unique elements
       convert the sorted elements back into a tuple
       return the new tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def union_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Combine the two tuples into one collection
    combined = tuple1 + tuple2
    
    # Remove duplicates by converting to a set
    unique_elements = set(combined)
    
    # Sort the unique elements
    sorted_elements = sorted(unique_elements)
    
    # Convert the sorted list back into a tuple
    return tuple(sorted_elements)
