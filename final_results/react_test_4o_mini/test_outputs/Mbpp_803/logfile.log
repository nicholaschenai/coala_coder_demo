You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/803 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that determines if a given number is a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares because they are 1Â², 2Â², 3Â², and 4Â² respectively. The function should return `True` if the number is a perfect square and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To check if a number is a perfect square, we can take the integer square root of the number and then square that result. If squaring the integer square root gives us back the original number, then it is a perfect square. If not, it is not a perfect square.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function `is_perfect_square` that takes an integer `n`.
   - If `n` is less than 0, return `False` (since negative numbers cannot be perfect squares).
   - Calculate the integer square root of `n` (let's call it `root`).
   - If `root * root` equals `n`, return `True`.
   - Otherwise, return `False`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def is_perfect_square(n: int) -> bool:
    # Check if the number is negative
    if n < 0:
        return False
    
    # Calculate the integer square root
    root = int(n**0.5)
    
    # Check if squaring the root gives the original number
    return root * root == n
