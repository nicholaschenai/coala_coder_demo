You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find the kth element in the given array using 1-based indexing.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/101 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that retrieves the kth element from a given list (array) of numbers, where the indexing starts at 1 instead of the usual 0.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the kth element in the list, we need to access the element at the index that is one less than k (since Python uses 0-based indexing). We will check if k is within the valid range of the list's length to avoid any index errors.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Function kth_element(array, k):
       If k is less than 1 or greater than the length of the array:
           Return an error or a message indicating invalid input
       Else:
           Return the element at index k-1 of the array
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def kth_element(array, k):
    # Check if k is less than 1 or greater than the length of the array
    if k < 1 or k > len(array):
        return None  # or raise an error, depending on requirements
    # Return the element at index k-1 (1-based to 0-based index conversion)
    return array[k - 1]
```
