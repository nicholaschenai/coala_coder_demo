We will check if k is within the valid range of the list's length to avoid any index errors.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Function kth_element(array, k):\n       If k is less than 1 or greater than the length of the array:\n           Return an error or a message indicating invalid input\n       Else:\n           Return the element at index k-1 of the array\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef kth_element(array, k):\n    # Check if k is less than 1 or greater than the length of the array\n    if k < 1 or k > len(array):\n        return None  # or raise an error, depending on requirements\n    # Return the element at index k-1 (1-based to 0-based index conversion)\n    return array[k - 1]\n```"
