If a character is uppercase, it should be converted to lowercase, and if it is lowercase, it should be converted to uppercase.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We can iterate through each character in the string. For each character, we will check if it is uppercase or lowercase. If it is uppercase, we will convert it to lowercase, and if it is lowercase, we will convert it to uppercase. We will then collect all the modified characters and join them back into a single string to return the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function toggle_string(input_string):\n       create an empty list to hold the toggled characters\n       for each character in input_string:\n           if character is uppercase:\n               convert it to lowercase and add to the list\n           else if character is lowercase:\n               convert it to uppercase and add to the list\n           else:\n               add the character as is to the list\n       join the list into a single string\n       return the new string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef toggle_string(input_string: str) -> str:\n    # Create an empty list to hold the toggled characters\n    toggled_chars = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the input string\n    for char in input_string:\n        # Check if the character is uppercase\n        if char.isupper():\n            # Convert it to lowercase and add to the list\n            toggled_chars.append(char.lower())\n        # Check if the character is lowercase\n        elif char.islower():\n            # Convert it to uppercase and add to the list\n            toggled_chars.append(char.upper())\n        else:\n            # Add the character as is to the list (for non-alphabetic characters)\n            toggled_chars.append(char)\n    \n    # Join the list into a single string\n    return ''.join(toggled_chars)\n```"
