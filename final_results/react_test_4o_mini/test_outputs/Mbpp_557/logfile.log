You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/557 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and changes each character's case. If a character is uppercase, it should be converted to lowercase, and if it is lowercase, it should be converted to uppercase.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   We can iterate through each character in the string. For each character, we will check if it is uppercase or lowercase. If it is uppercase, we will convert it to lowercase, and if it is lowercase, we will convert it to uppercase. We will then collect all the modified characters and join them back into a single string to return the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function toggle_string(input_string):
       create an empty list to hold the toggled characters
       for each character in input_string:
           if character is uppercase:
               convert it to lowercase and add to the list
           else if character is lowercase:
               convert it to uppercase and add to the list
           else:
               add the character as is to the list
       join the list into a single string
       return the new string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def toggle_string(input_string: str) -> str:
    # Create an empty list to hold the toggled characters
    toggled_chars = []
    
    # Iterate through each character in the input string

        if char.isupper():
            # Convert it to lowercase and add to the list
            toggled_chars.append(char.lower())

        elif char.islower():
            # Convert it to uppercase and add to the list
