You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/728 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that takes two lists of numbers as input and returns a new list where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from the two input lists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through both lists simultaneously, adding the elements at the same index together. We will store these sums in a new list, which we will return at the end.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Function sum_list(list_a, list_b):
       Initialize an empty list called result
       For each index i from 0 to the length of list_a:
           Add list_a[i] and list_b[i] and append the result to the result list
       Return the result list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def sum_list(list_a, list_b):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results
    result = []
    # Iterate through the indices of the input lists
    for i in range(len(list_a)):
        # Add the corresponding elements from both lists and append to result
        result.append(list_a[i] + list_b[i])
    # Return the final result list
    return result
