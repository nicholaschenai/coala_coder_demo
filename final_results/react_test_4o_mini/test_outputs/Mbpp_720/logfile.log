You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to add a dictionary to the tuple. The output should be a tuple.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/720 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a tuple and a dictionary as inputs. The function should return a new tuple that includes all the elements of the original tuple followed by the dictionary.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will define a function that accepts a tuple and a dictionary. Inside the function, we will convert the dictionary into a format that can be added to the tuple. Finally, we will return a new tuple that combines the original tuple with the dictionary.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Function add_dict_to_tuple(input_tuple, input_dict):
       Create a new tuple that is a combination of input_tuple and input_dict
       Return the new tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def add_dict_to_tuple(input_tuple, input_dict):
    # Create a new tuple that combines the original tuple with the dictionary
    new_tuple = input_tuple + (input_dict,)
    # Return the new tuple
    return new_tuple
