The function should apply the format string to each number in the list, replacing the placeholder in the format string with the number itself. The result should be a new list containing the formatted strings.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - We will define a function that takes two parameters: a list of numbers and a format string.\n   - We will iterate over each number in the list.\n   - For each number, we will use the format string to create a new string by replacing the placeholder with the current number.\n   - We will collect all the formatted strings in a new list and return that list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function add_string(numbers, format_string):\n       create an empty list called result\n       for each number in numbers:\n           formatted_string = format_string with number inserted\n           append formatted_string to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef add_string(numbers, format_string):\n    # Create an empty list to hold the results\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the input list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Format the string by replacing the placeholder with the current number\n        formatted_string = format_string.format(number)\n        \n        # Append the formatted string to the result list\n        result.append(formatted_string)\n    \n    # Return the list of formatted strings\n    return result\n```"
