For a parabola that opens upwards or downwards, the directrix can be calculated using the vertex form of the parabola. The formula I initially used was incorrect for the context of the problem.\n\n2. **Correct Formula for Directrix**: \n   The correct formula for the directrix of a parabola given in the standard form \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Directrix} = \\frac{-(b^2 - 4ac)}{4a} + \\frac{1}{4a}\n   \\]\n   This means that the directrix is actually derived from the vertex of the parabola, and I need to ensure that I am using the correct signs and operations.\n\n3. **Identifying the Mistake**: \n   In my previous implementation, I incorrectly calculated the directrix. Specifically, I used the wrong formula and also used integer division (`//`) instead of regular division (`/`), which could lead to incorrect results when dealing with floating-point numbers.\n\n4. **Revising the Approach**: \n   I need to revise the formula for the directrix and ensure that I am using proper division. The correct formula should be applied directly to the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) to compute the directrix accurately.\n\nNow, I will implement the corrected formula in the code. \n\n```python\ndef calculate_discriminant(a, b, c):\n    # Calculate the discriminant of the parabola\n    return b**2 - 4 * a * c\n\ndef parabola_directrix(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the discriminant using the helper function\n    discriminant = calculate_discriminant(a, b, c)\n    # Calculate the directrix using the correct formula\n    directrix = -(discriminant) / (4 * a) + (1 / (4 * a))\n    # Return the directrix value as an integer\n    return int(directrix)\n```"
