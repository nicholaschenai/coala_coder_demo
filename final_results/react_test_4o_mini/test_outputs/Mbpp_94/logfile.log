You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Given a list of tuples, write a function that returns the first value of the tuple with the smallest second value.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/94 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples as input. Each tuple contains two elements: a name (string) and a number (integer). The function should return the name from the tuple that has the smallest number.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of tuples, keeping track of the tuple with the smallest second value. We will compare the second values of each tuple and update our record of the smallest value and its corresponding name whenever we find a smaller second value.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function index_minimum(tuples_list):
       initialize min_value to a large number
       initialize min_name to an empty string
       
       for each tuple in tuples_list:
           if the second value of the tuple is less than min_value:
               update min_value to the second value of the tuple
               update min_name to the first value of the tuple
       
       return min_name
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def index_minimum(tuples_list):
    # Initialize min_value to a large number
    min_value = float('inf')
    # Initialize min_name to an empty string
    min_name = ''
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the list
    for name, value in tuples_list:
        # If the second value of the tuple is less than min_value
        if value < min_value:
            # Update min_value to the current second value
            min_value = value
            # Update min_name to the current first value
            min_name = name
    
    # Return the name associated with the smallest second value
    return min_name
