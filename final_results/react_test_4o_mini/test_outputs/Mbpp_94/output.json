    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples as input. Each tuple contains two elements: a name (string) and a number (integer). The function should return the name from the tuple that has the smallest number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of tuples, keeping track of the tuple with the smallest second value. We will compare the second values of each tuple and update our record of the smallest value and its corresponding name whenever we find a smaller second value.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function index_minimum(tuples_list):\n       initialize min_value to a large number\n       initialize min_name to an empty string\n       \n       for each tuple in tuples_list:\n           if the second value of the tuple is less than min_value:\n               update min_value to the second value of the tuple\n               update min_name to the first value of the tuple\n       \n       return min_name\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef index_minimum(tuples_list):\n    # Initialize min_value to a large number\n    min_value = float('inf')\n    # Initialize min_name to an empty string\n    min_name = ''\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the list\n    for name, value in tuples_list:\n        # If the second value of the tuple is less than min_value\n        if value < min_value:\n            # Update min_value to the current second value\n            min_value = value\n            # Update min_name to the current first value\n            min_name = name\n    \n    # Return the name associated with the smallest second value\n    return min_name\n```",
