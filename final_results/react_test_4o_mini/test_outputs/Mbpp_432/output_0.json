    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the median length of a trapezium given the lengths of its two parallel sides and the height. The function should return the median length, which is defined as the average of the two parallel sides.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the median length of a trapezium, we will take the lengths of the two parallel sides, add them together, and then divide the sum by 2. This will give us the average length of the two sides, which is the median length.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION median_trapezium(base1, base2, height):\n       median_length = (base1 + base2) / 2\n       RETURN median_length\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the median length of a trapezium\ndef median_trapezium(base1: int, base2: int, height: int) -> float:\n    # Calculate the median length by averaging the two bases\n    median_length = (base1 + base2) / 2\n    # Return the calculated median length\n    return median_length\n```",
