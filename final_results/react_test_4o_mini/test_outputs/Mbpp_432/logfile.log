You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/432 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the median length of a trapezium given the lengths of its two parallel sides and the height. The function should return the median length, which is defined as the average of the two parallel sides.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the median length of a trapezium, we will take the lengths of the two parallel sides, add them together, and then divide the sum by 2. This will give us the average length of the two sides, which is the median length.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION median_trapezium(base1, base2, height):
       median_length = (base1 + base2) / 2
       RETURN median_length
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to calculate the median length of a trapezium
def median_trapezium(base1: int, base2: int, height: int) -> float:
    # Calculate the median length by averaging the two bases
    median_length = (base1 + base2) / 2
    # Return the calculated median length
    return median_length
