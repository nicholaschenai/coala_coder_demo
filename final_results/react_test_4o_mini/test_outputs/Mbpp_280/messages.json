If the element is found, the function should return a tuple containing `True` and the index of that element. If the element is not found, it should return a tuple containing `False` and `-1`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list and check each element to see if it matches the target element. If we find a match, we will return `True` along with the index of that element. If we finish checking all elements without finding a match, we will return `False` and `-1`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function sequential_search(array, element):\n       for index from 0 to length of array - 1:\n           if array[index] is equal to element:\n               return (True, index)\n       return (False, -1)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef sequential_search(array, element):\n    # Iterate through the array using index\n    for index in range(len(array)):\n        # Check if the current element matches the target element\n        if array[index] == element:\n            # If found, return True and the index\n            return (True, index)\n    # If not found, return False and -1\n    return (False, -1)\n```"
