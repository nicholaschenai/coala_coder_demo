You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/280 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a specific element exists in a given list (array). If the element is found, the function should return a tuple containing `True` and the index of that element. If the element is not found, it should return a tuple containing `False` and `-1`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list and check each element to see if it matches the target element. If we find a match, we will return `True` along with the index of that element. If we finish checking all elements without finding a match, we will return `False` and `-1`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sequential_search(array, element):
       for index from 0 to length of array - 1:
           if array[index] is equal to element:
               return (True, index)
       return (False, -1)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def sequential_search(array, element):
    # Iterate through the array using index
    for index in range(len(array)):
        # Check if the current element matches the target element
        if array[index] == element:
            # If found, return True and the index
            return (True, index)
    # If not found, return False and -1
    return (False, -1)
