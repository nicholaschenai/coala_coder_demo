You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find the minimum product from the pairs of tuples within a given list.
assert min_product_tuple([(2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 8), (4, 9)] )==8

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/409 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should calculate the product of the two integers in each tuple and then return the smallest product found among all the tuples.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Initialize a variable to hold the minimum product, starting with a very large number (infinity).
   - Loop through each tuple in the list.
   - For each tuple, calculate the product of the two integers.
   - If the calculated product is smaller than the current minimum product, update the minimum product.
   - After checking all tuples, return the minimum product.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function min_product_tuple(tuples):
       initialize min_product to infinity
       for each tuple in tuples:
           calculate product as tuple[0] * tuple[1]
           if product < min_product:
               update min_product to product
       return min_product
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def min_product_tuple(tuples):
    # Initialize min_product to a very large number
    min_product = float('inf')

        # Calculate the product of the two integers in the tuple
        product = tup[0] * tup[1]
        
        # If the product is less than the current minimum product, update it
        if product < min_product:
            min_product = product
