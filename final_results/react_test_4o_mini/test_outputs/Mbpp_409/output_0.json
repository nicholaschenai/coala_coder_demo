    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should calculate the product of the two integers in each tuple and then return the smallest product found among all the tuples.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - Initialize a variable to hold the minimum product, starting with a very large number (infinity).\n   - Loop through each tuple in the list.\n   - For each tuple, calculate the product of the two integers.\n   - If the calculated product is smaller than the current minimum product, update the minimum product.\n   - After checking all tuples, return the minimum product.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function min_product_tuple(tuples):\n       initialize min_product to infinity\n       for each tuple in tuples:\n           calculate product as tuple[0] * tuple[1]\n           if product < min_product:\n               update min_product to product\n       return min_product\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef min_product_tuple(tuples):\n    # Initialize min_product to a very large number\n    min_product = float('inf')\n    \n    # Loop through each tuple in the list\n    for tup in tuples:\n        # Calculate the product of the two integers in the tuple\n        product = tup[0] * tup[1]\n        \n        # If the product is less than the current minimum product, update it\n        if product < min_product:\n            min_product = product\n            \n    # Return the minimum product found\n    return min_product\n```",
