INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/454 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/454 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given string contains the letter 'z'. If the string contains 'z', the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a simple approach where we check if the character 'z' is present in the input string. We can use the `in` keyword in Python, which allows us to check for the existence of a substring within a string. If 'z' is found, we return `True`; if not, we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION text_match_wordz(word):
       IF 'z' is in word:
           RETURN True
       ELSE:
           RETURN False
   ```

# Define the function that checks for the presence of 'z' in the input string
def text_match_wordz(word: str) -> bool:
    # Check if 'z' is in the provided word
    if 'z' in word:
        return True  # Return True if 'z' is found
    else:
        return False  # Return False if 'z' is not found
