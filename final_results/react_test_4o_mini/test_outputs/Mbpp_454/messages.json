If the string contains 'z', the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a simple approach where we check if the character 'z' is present in the input string. We can use the `in` keyword in Python, which allows us to check for the existence of a substring within a string. If 'z' is found, we return `True`; if not, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION text_match_wordz(word):\n       IF 'z' is in word:\n           RETURN True\n       ELSE:\n           RETURN False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define the function that checks for the presence of 'z' in the input string\ndef text_match_wordz(word: str) -> bool:\n    # Check if 'z' is in the provided word\n    if 'z' in word:\n        return True  # Return True if 'z' is found\n    else:\n        return False  # Return False if 'z' is not found\n```"
