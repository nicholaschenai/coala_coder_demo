You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/589 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes two numbers as input and returns a list of all perfect squares that lie between those two numbers, inclusive.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find perfect squares between two numbers, we can:
   - Determine the smallest integer whose square is greater than or equal to the first number.
   - Determine the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the second number.
   - Generate a list of squares of all integers from the smallest integer to the largest integer.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function perfect_squares(start, end):
       initialize an empty list for perfect squares
       find the smallest integer (i) such that i*i >= start
       find the largest integer (j) such that j*j <= end
       for each integer k from i to j:
           add k*k to the list of perfect squares
       return the list of perfect squares
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def perfect_squares(start: int, end: int) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to store perfect squares
    perfect_squares_list = []
    
    # Find the smallest integer whose square is >= start
    i = int(start**0.5)
    if i * i < start:
        i += 1
    
    # Find the largest integer whose square is <= end
    j = int(end**0.5)
    
    # Generate perfect squares from i to j
    for k in range(i, j + 1):
        perfect_squares_list.append(k * k)
    
    # Return the list of perfect squares
    return perfect_squares_list
