You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to check whether the given two integers have opposite sign or not.
assert opposite_Signs(1,-2) == True
"""

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/58 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: We need to create a function that takes two integers as input and checks if one integer is positive and the other is negative. If they have opposite signs, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To determine if two integers have opposite signs, we can check the product of the two integers. If the product is less than zero, it means one integer is positive and the other is negative. If the product is zero or greater, they either have the same sign or one of them is zero.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function opposite_Signs(a, b):
       if a * b < 0:
           return True
       else:
           return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to check if two integers have opposite signs
def opposite_Signs(a: int, b: int) -> bool:
    # Check if the product of the two numbers is less than zero
    if a * b < 0:
        return True  # They have opposite signs
    else:
        return False  # They do not have opposite signs
