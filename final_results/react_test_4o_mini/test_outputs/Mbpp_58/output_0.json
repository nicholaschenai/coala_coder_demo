    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: We need to create a function that takes two integers as input and checks if one integer is positive and the other is negative. If they have opposite signs, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To determine if two integers have opposite signs, we can check the product of the two integers. If the product is less than zero, it means one integer is positive and the other is negative. If the product is zero or greater, they either have the same sign or one of them is zero.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function opposite_Signs(a, b):\n       if a * b < 0:\n           return True\n       else:\n           return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to check if two integers have opposite signs\ndef opposite_Signs(a: int, b: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the product of the two numbers is less than zero\n    if a * b < 0:\n        return True  # They have opposite signs\n    else:\n        return False  # They do not have opposite signs\n```",
