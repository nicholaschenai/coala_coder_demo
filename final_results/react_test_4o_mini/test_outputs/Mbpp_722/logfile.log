1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/722 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a dictionary of students, where each student has a name and a tuple containing their height and weight. The function should also take two additional parameters: a minimum height and a minimum weight. The goal is to filter out and return a new dictionary that only includes students who have both a height and weight greater than the specified minimum values.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each student in the input dictionary.
   - For each student, we will check if their height and weight are both greater than the provided minimum values.
   - If both conditions are met, we will add that student to a new dictionary.
   - Finally, we will return the new dictionary containing only the students who meet the criteria.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function filter_data(students, min_height, min_weight):
       create an empty dictionary called filtered_students
       for each student in students:
           get the height and weight from the student's tuple
           if height is greater than min_height and weight is greater than min_weight:
               add the student to filtered_students
       return filtered_students

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/722 [generation text] Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Failure:**
   The assertion failed because the output of the function was an empty dictionary `{}` instead of the expected output `{'Cierra Vega': (6.2, 70)}`. This indicates that the filtering logic did not correctly identify any students that met the height and weight criteria.

2. **Identifying the Logic Error:**
   - The function checks if both the height and weight of each student are greater than the specified minimum values.
   - The issue arises from the condition used in the `if` statement. The current condition checks for "greater than" (`>`), which means that if a student's height or weight is equal to the minimum value, they will not be included in the filtered results. 

3. **Correcting the Condition:**
   - To include students who have height and weight equal to the minimum values, the condition should be changed from `>` to `>=`. This way, students who meet or exceed the minimum height and weight will be included in the results.

4. **Revising the Code:**
   - I will update the condition in the `if` statement to check for `>=` instead of `>`. 

Now, let's implement the corrected logic in the code.

```python
def filter_data(students, min_height, min_weight):
    # Create an empty dictionary to store filtered students
    filtered_students = {}
    
    # Iterate through each student in the input dictionary
    for student, (height, weight) in students.items():
        # Check if the student's height and weight are above or equal to the minimum values
        if height >= min_height and weight >= min_weight:
            # Add the student to the filtered dictionary
            filtered_students[student] = (height, weight)
    
    # Return the dictionary of filtered students
    return filtered_students
