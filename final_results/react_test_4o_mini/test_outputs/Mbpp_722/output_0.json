    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a dictionary of students, where each student has a name and a tuple containing their height and weight. The function should also take two additional parameters: a minimum height and a minimum weight. The goal is to filter out and return a new dictionary that only includes students who have both a height and weight greater than the specified minimum values.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate through each student in the input dictionary.\n   - For each student, we will check if their height and weight are both greater than the provided minimum values.\n   - If both conditions are met, we will add that student to a new dictionary.\n   - Finally, we will return the new dictionary containing only the students who meet the criteria.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function filter_data(students, min_height, min_weight):\n       create an empty dictionary called filtered_students\n       for each student in students:\n           get the height and weight from the student's tuple\n           if height is greater than min_height and weight is greater than min_weight:\n               add the student to filtered_students\n       return filtered_students\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef filter_data(students, min_height, min_weight):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store filtered students\n    filtered_students = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through each student in the input dictionary\n    for student, (height, weight) in students.items():\n        # Check if the student's height and weight are above the minimum values\n        if height > min_height and weight > min_weight:\n            # Add the student to the filtered dictionary\n            filtered_students[student] = (height, weight)\n    \n    # Return the dictionary of filtered students\n    return filtered_students\n```",
