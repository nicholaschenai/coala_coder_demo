The function should return `True` if the string meets this condition and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can use a regular expression pattern to match the desired format of the string. The pattern should allow for one or more lowercase letters followed by an optional underscore, and this can repeat. If the entire string matches this pattern, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `text_lowercase_underscore` that takes a string as input.\n   - Use a regular expression to check if the string consists of lowercase letters and underscores.\n   - If the string matches the pattern, return `True`.\n   - If it does not match, return `False`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Function to check if the input string contains sequences of lowercase letters joined with an underscore\ndef text_lowercase_underscore(s: str) -> bool:\n    # Define the regex pattern for lowercase letters and underscores\n    pattern = r'^[a-z]+(_[a-z]+)*$'\n    \n    # Use the fullmatch method to check if the entire string matches the pattern\n    return re.fullmatch(pattern, s) is not None\n```"
