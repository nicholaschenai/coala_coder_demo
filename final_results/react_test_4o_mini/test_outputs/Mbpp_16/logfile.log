You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to that returns true if the input string contains sequences of lowercase letters joined with an underscore and false otherwise.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/16 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a given string consists of sequences of lowercase letters that are separated by underscores. The function should return `True` if the string meets this condition and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a regular expression pattern to match the desired format of the string. The pattern should allow for one or more lowercase letters followed by an optional underscore, and this can repeat. If the entire string matches this pattern, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `text_lowercase_underscore` that takes a string as input.
   - Use a regular expression to check if the string consists of lowercase letters and underscores.
   - If the string matches the pattern, return `True`.
   - If it does not match, return `False`.
