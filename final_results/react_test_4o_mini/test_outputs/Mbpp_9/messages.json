A rotation involves moving characters from the front of the string to the back.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the minimum number of rotations, we can check how many times we can rotate the string before it returns to its original form. For example, if we have the string \"aaaa\", rotating it any number of times will still yield \"aaaa\". However, for a string like \"abc\", we can rotate it three times to return to the original string. We will iterate through the string and check each rotation until we find the one that matches the original string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_Rotations(s):\n       original = s\n       length = length of s\n       for i from 1 to length:\n           rotate s by 1 position to the left\n           if s equals original:\n               return i\n       return length (in case of no match, which shouldn't happen for valid input)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_Rotations(s: str) -> int:\n    # Store the original string to compare with\n    original = s\n    # Get the length of the string\n    length = len(s)\n    \n    # Iterate through possible rotations\n    for i in range(1, length + 1):\n        # Rotate the string by moving the first character to the end\n        s = s[1:] + s[0]\n        # Check if the rotated string matches the original\n        if s == original:\n            return i  # Return the number of rotations needed\n    \n    return length  # This return is just a fallback; it should not be reached\n\n```"
