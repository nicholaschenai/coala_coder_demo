You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/9 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that determines the minimum number of rotations required to make a string identical to itself. A rotation involves moving characters from the front of the string to the back.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the minimum number of rotations, we can check how many times we can rotate the string before it returns to its original form. For example, if we have the string "aaaa", rotating it any number of times will still yield "aaaa". However, for a string like "abc", we can rotate it three times to return to the original string. We will iterate through the string and check each rotation until we find the one that matches the original string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_Rotations(s):
       original = s
       length = length of s
       for i from 1 to length:
           rotate s by 1 position to the left
           if s equals original:
               return i
       return length (in case of no match, which shouldn't happen for valid input)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:

def find_Rotations(s: str) -> int:
    # Store the original string to compare with
    original = s
    # Get the length of the string
    length = len(s)
    
    # Iterate through possible rotations
    for i in range(1, length + 1):
        # Rotate the string by moving the first character to the end
        s = s[1:] + s[0]
        # Check if the rotated string matches the original
        if s == original:
            return i  # Return the number of rotations needed
    
    return length  # This return is just a fallback; it should not be reached
