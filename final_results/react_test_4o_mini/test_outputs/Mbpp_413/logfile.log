INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/413 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/413 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples and an integer `n`, and returns a list containing the `n`th element from each tuple in the list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - We will define a function that accepts two parameters: a list of tuples and an integer `n`.
   - We will iterate through each tuple in the list and extract the element at index `n`.
   - We will collect these elements into a new list and return that list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function extract_nth_element(tuples_list, n):
       create an empty list called result
       for each tuple in tuples_list:
           append the nth element of the tuple to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def extract_nth_element(tuples_list, n):
    # Create an empty list to store the nth elements
    result = []
    # Iterate through each tuple in the provided list
    for tuple in tuples_list:
        # Append the nth element of the tuple to the result list
        result.append(tuple[n])
    # Return the list of nth elements
    return result
