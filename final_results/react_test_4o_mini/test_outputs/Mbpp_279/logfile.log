You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/279 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the nth decagonal number. A decagonal number is a figurate number that represents a decagon (a ten-sided polygon). The formula to find the nth decagonal number is given by the formula: \( D(n) = 4n^2 - 3n \).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the nth decagonal number, we will use the formula mentioned above. We will take an integer input `n`, apply the formula, and return the result. The function should handle any positive integer input.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION is_num_decagonal(n):
       IF n is less than 1:
           RETURN an error or invalid input
       ENDIF
       decagonal_number = 4 * n * n - 3 * n
       RETURN decagonal_number
   END FUNCTION
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Function to calculate the nth decagonal number
def is_num_decagonal(n):
    # Check if n is a valid positive integer
    if n < 1:
        return None  # or raise an error for invalid input
    # Calculate the nth decagonal number using the formula
    decagonal_number = 4 * n * n - 3 * n
    return decagonal_number  # Return the calculated decagonal number
