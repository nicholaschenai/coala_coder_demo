You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/635 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function called `heap_sort` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with those numbers sorted in ascending order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To sort the list using the heap sort algorithm, we will:
   - Build a max heap from the input list.
   - Repeatedly extract the maximum element from the heap and place it at the end of the list.
   - Adjust the heap after each extraction to maintain the heap property.
   - The result will be a sorted list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function heap_sort(arr):
       n = length of arr
       build_max_heap(arr, n)
       for i from n-1 down to 1:
           swap arr[0] with arr[i]
           heapify(arr, 0, i)
       return arr

   function build_max_heap(arr, n):
       for i from n//2 - 1 down to 0:
           heapify(arr, i, n)

   function heapify(arr, i, n):
       largest = i
       left = 2*i + 1
       right = 2*i + 2
       if left < n and arr[left] > arr[largest]:
           largest = left
       if right < n and arr[right] > arr[largest]:
           largest = right
       if largest != i:
           swap arr[i] with arr[largest]
           heapify(arr, largest, n)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def heapify(arr, n, i):
    largest = i  # Initialize largest as root
