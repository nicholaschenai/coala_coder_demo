You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/59 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the nth octagonal number. An octagonal number is a figurate number that represents an octagon. The formula to find the nth octagonal number is given by the formula: \( O(n) = n(3n - 2) \).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the nth octagonal number, we will use the formula mentioned above. We will take the input number n, apply the formula, and return the result. The function will be straightforward since it involves basic arithmetic operations.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION is_octagonal(n):
       RETURN n * (3 * n - 2)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to calculate the nth octagonal number
def is_octagonal(n):
    # Use the formula for the nth octagonal number
    return n * (3 * n - 2)  # Calculate and return the result
```
