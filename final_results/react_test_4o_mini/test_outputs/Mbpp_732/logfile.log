INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/732 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/732 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and replaces every space, comma, or dot in that string with a colon. 

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the input string. If the character is a space, comma, or dot, we will replace it with a colon. If it is any other character, we will keep it unchanged. Finally, we will join all the characters back together to form the modified string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function replace_specialchar(input_string):
       create an empty list to hold characters
       for each character in input_string:
           if character is a space or a comma or a dot:
               append ':' to the list
           else:
               append the character to the list
       join the list into a single string
       return the new string
   ```

def replace_specialchar(input_string: str) -> str:
    # Create an empty list to hold characters

        if char == ' ' or char == ',' or char == '.':
            # Replace with a colon
            result.append(':')
        else:
            # Keep the character unchanged
            result.append(char)
    
    # Join the list into a single string
    return ''.join(result)
