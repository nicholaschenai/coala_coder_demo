The function should split the list into two parts at the `n`th index and then rearrange the list by moving the first part to the end of the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - First, we will check if `n` is within the bounds of the list. If `n` is greater than the length of the list, we will adjust it to be the length of the list.\n   - Next, we will split the list into two parts: the first part will contain elements from the start of the list up to (but not including) the `n`th element, and the second part will contain the rest of the elements.\n   - Finally, we will concatenate the second part with the first part and return the new list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function split_Arr(arr, n):\n       if n > length of arr:\n           n = length of arr\n       first_part = arr[0:n]\n       second_part = arr[n:length of arr]\n       return second_part + first_part\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef split_Arr(arr, n):\n    # Check if n is greater than the length of the array\n    if n > len(arr):\n        n = len(arr)  # Adjust n to be the length of the array if it is too large\n    # Split the array into two parts\n    first_part = arr[0:n]  # Elements from the start to the nth element (exclusive)\n    second_part = arr[n:]   # Elements from the nth element to the end\n    # Concatenate the second part with the first part and return\n    return second_part + first_part\n```"
