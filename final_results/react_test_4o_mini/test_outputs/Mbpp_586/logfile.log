You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/586 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list and an integer `n`. The function should split the list into two parts at the `n`th index and then rearrange the list by moving the first part to the end of the list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - First, we will check if `n` is within the bounds of the list. If `n` is greater than the length of the list, we will adjust it to be the length of the list.
   - Next, we will split the list into two parts: the first part will contain elements from the start of the list up to (but not including) the `n`th element, and the second part will contain the rest of the elements.
   - Finally, we will concatenate the second part with the first part and return the new list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function split_Arr(arr, n):
       if n > length of arr:
           n = length of arr
       first_part = arr[0:n]
       second_part = arr[n:length of arr]
       return second_part + first_part
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def split_Arr(arr, n):
    # Check if n is greater than the length of the array
    if n > len(arr):
        n = len(arr)  # Adjust n to be the length of the array if it is too large
    # Split the array into two parts
    first_part = arr[0:n]  # Elements from the start to the nth element (exclusive)
    second_part = arr[n:]   # Elements from the nth element to the end
    # Concatenate the second part with the first part and return
    return second_part + first_part
```
