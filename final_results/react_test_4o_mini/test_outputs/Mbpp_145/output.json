    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The task is to create a function that takes a tuple of numbers and returns the maximum difference between any two numbers in that tuple.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To find the maximum difference between any two elements in the tuple, we can identify the largest and smallest numbers in the tuple. The maximum difference will then be the difference between these two numbers. This can be achieved by iterating through the tuple to find the minimum and maximum values.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Function max_Abs_Diff(arr):\n       Initialize min_value to a very large number\n       Initialize max_value to a very small number\n       \n       For each number in arr:\n           If number is less than min_value:\n               Update min_value to number\n           If number is greater than max_value:\n               Update max_value to number\n       \n       Return max_value - min_value\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef max_Abs_Diff(arr):\n    # Initialize min_value to a very large number\n    min_value = float('inf')\n    # Initialize max_value to a very small number\n    max_value = float('-inf')\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the input tuple\n    for number in arr:\n        # Update min_value if the current number is smaller\n        if number < min_value:\n            min_value = number\n        # Update max_value if the current number is larger\n        if number > max_value:\n            max_value = number\n    \n    # Return the difference between max_value and min_value\n    return max_value - min_value\n```",
