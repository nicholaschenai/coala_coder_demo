After that, we can count how many zeros were in the original list and append that many zeros to the end of the new list. This way, we maintain the order of non-zero elements and move all zeros to the end.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function move_zero(input_list):\n       create an empty list called non_zero_elements\n       initialize a zero_count variable to 0\n       \n       for each element in input_list:\n           if element is not zero:\n               append element to non_zero_elements\n           else:\n               increment zero_count by 1\n       \n       append zero_count number of zeros to non_zero_elements\n       return non_zero_elements\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef move_zero(input_list):\n    # Create an empty list to hold non-zero elements\n    non_zero_elements = []\n    # Initialize a counter for zeros\n    zero_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the input list\n    for element in input_list:\n        # If the element is not zero, add it to the non-zero list\n        if element != 0:\n            non_zero_elements.append(element)\n        else:\n            # If it is zero, increment the zero counter\n            zero_count += 1\n    \n    # Append the counted zeros to the end of the non-zero list\n    non_zero_elements.extend([0] * zero_count)\n    \n    # Return the final list with zeros moved to the end\n    return non_zero_elements\n```"
