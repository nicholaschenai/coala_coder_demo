You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/632 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and moves all the zeros in that list to the end, while keeping the order of the non-zero elements the same.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   We can iterate through the list and collect all non-zero elements in a new list. After that, we can count how many zeros were in the original list and append that many zeros to the end of the new list. This way, we maintain the order of non-zero elements and move all zeros to the end.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function move_zero(input_list):
       create an empty list called non_zero_elements
       initialize a zero_count variable to 0
       
       for each element in input_list:
           if element is not zero:
               append element to non_zero_elements
           else:
               increment zero_count by 1
       
       append zero_count number of zeros to non_zero_elements
       return non_zero_elements
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def move_zero(input_list):
    # Create an empty list to hold non-zero elements
    non_zero_elements = []
    # Initialize a counter for zeros
    zero_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each element in the input list
    for element in input_list:
        # If the element is not zero, add it to the non-zero list
        if element != 0:
            non_zero_elements.append(element)
        else:
            # If it is zero, increment the zero counter
            zero_count += 1
    
    # Append the counted zeros to the end of the non-zero list
    non_zero_elements.extend([0] * zero_count)
    
    # Return the final list with zeros moved to the end
    return non_zero_elements
