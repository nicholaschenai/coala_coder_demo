INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/118 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/118 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and splits it into a list of substrings based on spaces. For example, if the input is "python programming", the output should be a list containing the words ['python', 'programming'].

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use the built-in string method `split()`, which splits a string into a list where each word is a separate element. By default, `split()` will use any whitespace as the delimiter, which is exactly what we need for this task.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function named `string_to_list` that takes a single string parameter.
   - Use the `split()` method on the input string to divide it into a list of words.
   - Return the resulting list.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function named string_to_list that takes a string as input
def string_to_list(input_string: str) -> list:
    # Use the split method to divide the string into a list of words
    words_list = input_string.split()
    # Return the list of words
    return words_list
