For example, if the input is \"python programming\", the output should be a list containing the words ['python', 'programming'].\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use the built-in string method `split()`, which splits a string into a list where each word is a separate element. By default, `split()` will use any whitespace as the delimiter, which is exactly what we need for this task.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function named `string_to_list` that takes a single string parameter.\n   - Use the `split()` method on the input string to divide it into a list of words.\n   - Return the resulting list.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function named string_to_list that takes a string as input\ndef string_to_list(input_string: str) -> list:\n    # Use the split method to divide the string into a list of words\n    words_list = input_string.split()\n    # Return the list of words\n    return words_list\n```"
