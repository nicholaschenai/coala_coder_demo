INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/742 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the area of a tetrahedron given the length of its edges. The function should return a floating-point number representing the area.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   The area of a tetrahedron can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{12} \times a^2 \times \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}
   \]
   where \( a \) is the length of an edge of the tetrahedron. We will implement this formula in a function that takes the edge length as input and returns the calculated area.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION area_tetrahedron(edge_length):
       SET area = (sqrt(2) / 12) * (edge_length^2) * sqrt(2 + sqrt(2))
       RETURN area
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/742 [generation text] Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to calculate the area of a tetrahedron given the length of its edges. The formula I initially used was incorrect for calculating the area of a tetrahedron. 

2. **Identifying the Error**: The formula I used in the previous code was not the correct formula for the surface area of a tetrahedron. The surface area of a regular tetrahedron can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \sqrt{3} \times a^2
   \]
   where \( a \) is the length of an edge. 

3. **Correcting the Approach**: I need to replace the incorrect formula with the correct one for the surface area of a tetrahedron. 

4. **Revising the Code**: I will implement the correct formula in the function and ensure that it returns the expected result.

Now, I will provide the corrected Python code with the appropriate formula for the area of a tetrahedron.

```python
import math

# Function to calculate the area of a tetrahedron
def area_tetrahedron(edge_length):
    # Calculate the area using the correct formula for the surface area of a tetrahedron
    area = math.sqrt(3) * (edge_length ** 2)
    return area
