The function should take an integer input representing the dog's age in human years and return an integer representing the dog's age in dog years.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To convert human years to dog years, we can use a common formula where the first two years of a dog's life are equivalent to 10.5 human years each, and every year after that is equivalent to 4 human years. Therefore, if the dog's age is 2 years or less, we multiply the age by 10.5. If the age is greater than 2, we calculate the first two years as 21 (2 * 10.5) and then add 4 for each additional year.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function dog_age(human_years):\n       if human_years <= 2:\n           return human_years * 10.5\n       else:\n           return 21 + (human_years - 2) * 4\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate dog's age in dog's years\ndef dog_age(human_years: int) -> int:\n    # If the dog's age is 2 years or less\n    if human_years <= 2:\n        # Calculate dog's age as 10.5 years for each human year\n        return int(human_years * 10.5)\n    else:\n        # Calculate the age for the first two years\n        # and add 4 for each additional year\n        return 21 + (human_years - 2) * 4\n```"
