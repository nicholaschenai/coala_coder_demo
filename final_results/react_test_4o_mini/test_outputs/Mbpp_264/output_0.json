    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that converts a dog's age in human years to its equivalent age in dog years. The function should take an integer input representing the dog's age in human years and return an integer representing the dog's age in dog years.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To convert human years to dog years, we can use a common formula where the first two years of a dog's life are equivalent to 10.5 human years each, and every year after that is equivalent to 4 human years. Therefore, if the dog's age is 2 years or less, we multiply the age by 10.5. If the age is greater than 2, we calculate the first two years as 21 (2 * 10.5) and then add 4 for each additional year.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function dog_age(human_years):\n       if human_years <= 2:\n           return human_years * 10.5\n       else:\n           return 21 + (human_years - 2) * 4\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate dog's age in dog's years\ndef dog_age(human_years: int) -> int:\n    # If the dog's age is 2 years or less\n    if human_years <= 2:\n        # Calculate dog's age as 10.5 years for each human year\n        return int(human_years * 10.5)\n    else:\n        # Calculate the age for the first two years\n        # and add 4 for each additional year\n        return 21 + (human_years - 2) * 4\n```",
