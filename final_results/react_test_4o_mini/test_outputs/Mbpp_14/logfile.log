You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/14 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the volume of a triangular prism given its base area and height. The function should take three parameters: the base length, the height of the triangle, and the height of the prism itself. The expected output is the volume of the prism.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the volume of a triangular prism, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height of the Prism}
   \]
   The base area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Base Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base Length} \times \text{Height of the Triangle}
   \]
   Therefore, we can combine these two formulas to find the volume of the prism.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION find_Volume(base_length, triangle_height, prism_height):
       Calculate base_area = (1/2) * base_length * triangle_height
       Calculate volume = base_area * prism_height
       RETURN volume
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def find_Volume(base_length: float, triangle_height: float, prism_height: float) -> float:
    # Calculate the area of the triangular base
    base_area = (1/2) * base_length * triangle_height
    # Calculate the volume of the prism
    volume = base_area * prism_height
    # Return the calculated volume
    return volume
```
