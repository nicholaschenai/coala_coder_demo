You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/233 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cylinder given its height and radius. The lateral surface area is the area of the side of the cylinder, excluding the top and bottom.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the lateral surface area of a cylinder, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2 \pi r h
   \]
   where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. We will use the value of \( \pi \) as approximately 3.14159 for our calculations.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Define a function lateralsurface_cylinder(radius, height):
       Set pi to 3.14159
       Calculate lateral surface area using the formula: 2 * pi * radius * height
       Return the calculated lateral surface area
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def lateralsurface_cylinder(radius: float, height: float) -> float:
    # Define the value of pi
    pi = 3.14159
    # Calculate the lateral surface area using the formula
    lateral_surface_area = 2 * pi * radius * height
    # Return the calculated lateral surface area
    return lateral_surface_area
```
