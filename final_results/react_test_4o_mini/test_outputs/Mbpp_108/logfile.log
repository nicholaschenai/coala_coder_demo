You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/108 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes three separate lists of numbers as input and combines them into one single list. This combined list should be sorted in ascending order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - First, we will concatenate the three input lists into one single list.
   - Then, we will sort this combined list in ascending order.
   - Finally, we will return the sorted list as the output.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function merge_sorted_list(list1, list2, list3):
       combined_list = concatenate list1, list2, and list3
       sorted_list = sort combined_list
       return sorted_list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def merge_sorted_list(list1, list2, list3):
    # Step 1: Combine the three lists into one
    combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3
    
    # Step 2: Sort the combined list
    sorted_list = sorted(combined_list)
    
    # Step 3: Return the sorted list
    return sorted_list
```
