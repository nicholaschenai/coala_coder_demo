    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the perimeter of a regular pentagon given the length of one of its sides. A regular pentagon has five equal sides, so the perimeter is simply five times the length of one side.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the perimeter of a regular pentagon, we will take the length of one side as input and multiply it by 5. This will give us the total length around the pentagon.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION perimeter_pentagon(side_length):\n       SET perimeter = side_length * 5\n       RETURN perimeter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the perimeter of a regular pentagon\ndef perimeter_pentagon(side_length):\n    # Calculate the perimeter by multiplying the side length by 5\n    perimeter = side_length * 5\n    # Return the calculated perimeter\n    return perimeter\n```",
