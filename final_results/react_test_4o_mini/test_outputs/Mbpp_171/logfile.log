INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/171 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find the perimeter of a regular pentagon from the length of its sides.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/171 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the perimeter of a regular pentagon given the length of one of its sides. A regular pentagon has five equal sides, so the perimeter is simply five times the length of one side.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the perimeter of a regular pentagon, we will take the length of one side as input and multiply it by 5. This will give us the total length around the pentagon.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION perimeter_pentagon(side_length):
       SET perimeter = side_length * 5
       RETURN perimeter
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to calculate the perimeter of a regular pentagon
def perimeter_pentagon(side_length):
    # Calculate the perimeter by multiplying the side length by 5
    perimeter = side_length * 5
    # Return the calculated perimeter
    return perimeter
```
