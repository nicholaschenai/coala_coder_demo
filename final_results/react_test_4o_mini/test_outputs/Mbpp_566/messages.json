For example, if the input is 345, the output should be 12 because 3 + 4 + 5 equals 12.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can convert the integer into a string to easily access each digit. Then, we can iterate through each character in the string, convert it back to an integer, and keep a running total of these integers. Finally, we will return the total sum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function sum_digits(n):\n       initialize total to 0\n       convert n to string\n       for each character in the string:\n           convert character to integer\n           add integer to total\n       return total\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef sum_digits(n):\n    # Initialize total to 0\n    total = 0\n    # Convert the integer to a string to iterate over each digit\n    for digit in str(n):\n        # Convert the character back to an integer and add to total\n        total += int(digit)\n    # Return the total sum of the digits\n    return total\n```"
