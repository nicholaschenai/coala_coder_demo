You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/566 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a non-negative integer as input and returns the sum of its digits. For example, if the input is 345, the output should be 12 because 3 + 4 + 5 equals 12.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can convert the integer into a string to easily access each digit. Then, we can iterate through each character in the string, convert it back to an integer, and keep a running total of these integers. Finally, we will return the total sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function sum_digits(n):
       initialize total to 0
       convert n to string
       for each character in the string:
           convert character to integer
           add integer to total
       return total
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def sum_digits(n):
    # Initialize total to 0
    total = 0
    # Convert the integer to a string to iterate over each digit
    for digit in str(n):
        # Convert the character back to an integer and add to total
        total += int(digit)
    # Return the total sum of the digits
    return total
