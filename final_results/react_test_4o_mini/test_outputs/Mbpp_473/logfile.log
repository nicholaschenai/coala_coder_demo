You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/473 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes two lists of tuples as input and finds the common tuples between them, regardless of the order of the elements within the tuples. The result should be a set of these common tuples.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through the first list of tuples and check if each tuple (with its elements in any order) exists in the second list of tuples.
   - To check for the existence of a tuple irrespective of the order of its elements, we can sort the elements of the tuples before comparison.
   - We will collect all the common tuples in a set to ensure uniqueness and return this set as the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function tuple_intersection(list1, list2):
       create an empty set called result
       for each tuple in list1:
           sort the tuple and convert it to a frozenset
           for each tuple in list2:
               sort the tuple and convert it to a frozenset
               if the frozenset of the first tuple is equal to the frozenset of the second tuple:
                   add the original tuple from list1 to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def tuple_intersection(list1, list2):
    # Create an empty set to store the result
    result = set()
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the first list
    for tup1 in list1:
        # Sort the first tuple and convert it to a frozenset for comparison
        sorted_tup1 = frozenset(tup1)
