    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes two lists of tuples as input and finds the common tuples between them, regardless of the order of the elements within the tuples. The result should be a set of these common tuples.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate through the first list of tuples and check if each tuple (with its elements in any order) exists in the second list of tuples.\n   - To check for the existence of a tuple irrespective of the order of its elements, we can sort the elements of the tuples before comparison.\n   - We will collect all the common tuples in a set to ensure uniqueness and return this set as the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function tuple_intersection(list1, list2):\n       create an empty set called result\n       for each tuple in list1:\n           sort the tuple and convert it to a frozenset\n           for each tuple in list2:\n               sort the tuple and convert it to a frozenset\n               if the frozenset of the first tuple is equal to the frozenset of the second tuple:\n                   add the original tuple from list1 to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef tuple_intersection(list1, list2):\n    # Create an empty set to store the result\n    result = set()\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the first list\n    for tup1 in list1:\n        # Sort the first tuple and convert it to a frozenset for comparison\n        sorted_tup1 = frozenset(tup1)\n        \n        # Iterate through each tuple in the second list\n        for tup2 in list2:\n            # Sort the second tuple and convert it to a frozenset for comparison\n            sorted_tup2 = frozenset(tup2)\n            \n            # Check if the sorted frozensets are equal\n            if sorted_tup1 == sorted_tup2:\n                # If they are equal, add the original tuple from list1 to the result set\n                result.add(tup1)\n    \n    # Return the set of common tuples\n    return result\n```",
