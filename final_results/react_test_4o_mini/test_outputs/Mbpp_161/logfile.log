You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/161 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes two lists as input. The first list contains a series of numbers, and the second list contains numbers that we want to remove from the first list. The function should return a new list that contains only the numbers from the first list that are not present in the second list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the first list and check if each element is present in the second list. If an element from the first list is not found in the second list, we will add it to a new list. Finally, we will return this new list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function remove_elements(list1, list2):
       create an empty list called result
       for each element in list1:
           if element is not in list2:
               add element to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def remove_elements(list1, list2):
    # Create an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through each element in the first list
    for element in list1:
        # Check if the element is not in the second list
        if element not in list2:
            # If not, add it to the result list
            result.append(element)
    
    # Return the final result list
    return result
