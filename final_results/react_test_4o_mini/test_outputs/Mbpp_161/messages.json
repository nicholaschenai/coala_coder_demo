The function should return a new list that contains only the numbers from the first list that are not present in the second list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the first list and check if each element is present in the second list. If an element from the first list is not found in the second list, we will add it to a new list. Finally, we will return this new list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function remove_elements(list1, list2):\n       create an empty list called result\n       for each element in list1:\n           if element is not in list2:\n               add element to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef remove_elements(list1, list2):\n    # Create an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the first list\n    for element in list1:\n        # Check if the element is not in the second list\n        if element not in list2:\n            # If not, add it to the result list\n            result.append(element)\n    \n    # Return the final result list\n    return result\n```"
