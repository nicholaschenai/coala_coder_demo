INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/410 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find the minimum value in a given heterogeneous list.
assert min_val(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version'])==2

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/410 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list containing different types of elements (like strings and numbers) and returns the smallest numerical value from that list. If there are no numerical values, the function should not return anything.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each element in the list. We will check if the element is a number (either an integer or a float). If it is, we will compare it with the current minimum value we have found. If it is smaller, we will update our minimum value. At the end of the iteration, we will return the smallest number we found.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function min_val(input_list):
       initialize min_value to None
       for each element in input_list:
           if element is a number:
               if min_value is None or element < min_value:
                   set min_value to element
       return min_value
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def is_number(value):
    # Check if the value is an integer or a float
    return isinstance(value, (int, float))

            if min_value is None or element < min_value:
                # Update min_value to the current element
