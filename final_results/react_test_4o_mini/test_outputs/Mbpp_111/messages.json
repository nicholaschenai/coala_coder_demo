The output should be a list of these common elements.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To find the common elements in the nested lists, we can start by taking the first inner list as a reference. We will then check each element in this reference list to see if it exists in all the other inner lists. If an element is found in all lists, we will add it to our result list. Finally, we will return the list of common elements.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):\n       if nested_lists is empty:\n           return empty list\n       \n       initialize common_elements as an empty list\n       take the first inner list as reference_list\n       \n       for each element in reference_list:\n           set is_common to true\n           for each inner_list in nested_lists:\n               if element is not in inner_list:\n                   set is_common to false\n                   break\n           if is_common is true:\n               add element to common_elements\n       \n       return common_elements\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):\n    # Check if the input list is empty\n    if not nested_lists:\n        return []\n    \n    # Initialize a list to hold common elements\n    common_elements = []\n    \n    # Take the first inner list as the reference list\n    reference_list = nested_lists[0]\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the reference list\n    for element in reference_list:\n        is_common = True  # Assume the element is common\n        \n        # Check if the element is present in all other inner lists\n        for inner_list in nested_lists:\n            if element not in inner_list:\n                is_common = False  # Element is not common\n                break  # No need to check further\n        \n        # If the element is common, add it to the common_elements list\n        if is_common:\n            common_elements.append(element)\n    \n    # Return the list of common elements\n    return common_elements\n```"
