You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/111 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists (nested lists) and finds the elements that are common across all the inner lists. The output should be a list of these common elements.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the common elements in the nested lists, we can start by taking the first inner list as a reference. We will then check each element in this reference list to see if it exists in all the other inner lists. If an element is found in all lists, we will add it to our result list. Finally, we will return the list of common elements.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):
       if nested_lists is empty:
           return empty list
       
       initialize common_elements as an empty list
       take the first inner list as reference_list
       
       for each element in reference_list:
           set is_common to true
           for each inner_list in nested_lists:
               if element is not in inner_list:
                   set is_common to false
                   break
           if is_common is true:
               add element to common_elements
       
       return common_elements
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):
