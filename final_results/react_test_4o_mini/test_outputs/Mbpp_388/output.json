    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`. For example, if `n` is 10, the function should return 8, since 8 is the highest power of 2 that does not exceed 10.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`, we can start from 1 (which is 2^0) and keep multiplying by 2 until we exceed `n`. The last value we calculated before exceeding `n` will be our answer.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function highest_Power_of_2(n):\n       initialize power as 1\n       while power * 2 <= n:\n           power = power * 2\n       return power\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef highest_Power_of_2(n):\n    # Initialize the variable to hold the current power of 2\n    power = 1\n    \n    # Keep doubling the power until it exceeds n\n    while power * 2 <= n:\n        power = power * 2\n    \n    # Return the highest power of 2 found\n    return power\n```",
