INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/388 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/388 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`. For example, if `n` is 10, the function should return 8, since 8 is the highest power of 2 that does not exceed 10.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`, we can start from 1 (which is 2^0) and keep multiplying by 2 until we exceed `n`. The last value we calculated before exceeding `n` will be our answer.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function highest_Power_of_2(n):
       initialize power as 1
       while power * 2 <= n:
           power = power * 2
       return power
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def highest_Power_of_2(n):
    # Initialize the variable to hold the current power of 2
    power = 1
    
    # Keep doubling the power until it exceeds n
    while power * 2 <= n:
        power = power * 2
    
    # Return the highest power of 2 found
    return power
