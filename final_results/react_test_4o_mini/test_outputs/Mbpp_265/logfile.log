You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/265 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list and an integer `n`. The function should split the list into smaller lists, where each smaller list contains elements that are spaced `n` positions apart in the original list. The result should be a list of these smaller lists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the original list and collect elements into separate lists based on their index. For every index `i`, we will take the elements at positions `i`, `i+n`, `i+2n`, etc., until we reach the end of the list. We will repeat this for each starting index from `0` to `n-1`, creating a new list for each starting index.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function list_split(input_list, n):
       create an empty list called result
       for i from 0 to n-1:
           create an empty list called temp
           for j from i to length of input_list with step n:
               append input_list[j] to temp
           append temp to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def list_split(input_list, n):
    # Create an empty list to hold the resulting lists
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the range from 0 to n-1
    for i in range(n):
        # Create a temporary list to hold the current split
        temp = []
        
        # Iterate through the input list starting from index i, stepping by n
        for j in range(i, len(input_list), n):
            # Append the current element to the temporary list
            temp.append(input_list[j])
        
        # Append the temporary list to the result
        result.append(temp)
    
    # Return the final list of lists
