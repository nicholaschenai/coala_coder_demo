You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/763 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a tuple of integers and finds the smallest difference between any two numbers in that tuple. The function should return this minimum difference.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the minimum difference between any two elements in the tuple, we can follow these steps:
   - Sort the tuple to arrange the numbers in ascending order.
   - Iterate through the sorted numbers and calculate the difference between each pair of consecutive numbers.
   - Keep track of the smallest difference found during the iteration.
   - Return this smallest difference as the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_min_diff(arr, n):
       sort arr
       min_diff = infinity
       for i from 0 to n-2:
           diff = arr[i+1] - arr[i]
           if diff < min_diff:
               min_diff = diff
       return min_diff
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def find_min_diff(arr, n):
    # Step 1: Sort the array
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr)
    
    # Step 2: Initialize the minimum difference to a large value
    min_diff = float('inf')
    
    # Step 3: Iterate through the sorted array to find the minimum difference
    for i in range(n - 1):
        # Calculate the difference between consecutive elements
        diff = sorted_arr[i + 1] - sorted_arr[i]
        
        # Update min_diff if the current difference is smaller
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            
    # Step 4: Return the minimum difference found
    return min_diff
