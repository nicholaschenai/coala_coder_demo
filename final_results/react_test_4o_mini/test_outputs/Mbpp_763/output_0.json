    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a tuple of integers and finds the smallest difference between any two numbers in that tuple. The function should return this minimum difference.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To find the minimum difference between any two elements in the tuple, we can follow these steps:\n   - Sort the tuple to arrange the numbers in ascending order.\n   - Iterate through the sorted numbers and calculate the difference between each pair of consecutive numbers.\n   - Keep track of the smallest difference found during the iteration.\n   - Return this smallest difference as the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function find_min_diff(arr, n):\n       sort arr\n       min_diff = infinity\n       for i from 0 to n-2:\n           diff = arr[i+1] - arr[i]\n           if diff < min_diff:\n               min_diff = diff\n       return min_diff\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef find_min_diff(arr, n):\n    # Step 1: Sort the array\n    sorted_arr = sorted(arr)\n    \n    # Step 2: Initialize the minimum difference to a large value\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    \n    # Step 3: Iterate through the sorted array to find the minimum difference\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        # Calculate the difference between consecutive elements\n        diff = sorted_arr[i + 1] - sorted_arr[i]\n        \n        # Update min_diff if the current difference is smaller\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            \n    # Step 4: Return the minimum difference found\n    return min_diff\n```",
