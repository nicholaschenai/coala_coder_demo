You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/804 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if the product of all the numbers in a given list is even. If the product is even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if the product of the numbers is even, we can multiply the numbers together. However, we can simplify our approach by checking if any of the numbers in the list is even. If at least one number is even, the product will be even. If all numbers are odd, the product will be odd. 

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function `is_product_even` that takes a list of integers as input.
   - Initialize a variable `is_even` to `False`.
   - Loop through each number in the list:
     - If the number is even (i.e., the number modulo 2 equals 0), set `is_even` to `True` and break the loop.
   - Return the value of `is_even`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def is_product_even(numbers):
    # Initialize a variable to track if we found an even number
    is_even = False
    
    # Loop through each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the current number is even
        if number % 2 == 0:
            is_even = True  # Set is_even to True if we find an even number
            break  # No need to check further, we can exit the loop
    
    # Return whether the product is even or not
    return is_even
