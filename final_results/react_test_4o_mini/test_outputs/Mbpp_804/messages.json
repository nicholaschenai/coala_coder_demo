If the product is even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if the product of the numbers is even, we can multiply the numbers together. However, we can simplify our approach by checking if any of the numbers in the list is even. If at least one number is even, the product will be even. If all numbers are odd, the product will be odd. \n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function `is_product_even` that takes a list of integers as input.\n   - Initialize a variable `is_even` to `False`.\n   - Loop through each number in the list:\n     - If the number is even (i.e., the number modulo 2 equals 0), set `is_even` to `True` and break the loop.\n   - Return the value of `is_even`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef is_product_even(numbers):\n    # Initialize a variable to track if we found an even number\n    is_even = False\n    \n    # Loop through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the current number is even\n        if number % 2 == 0:\n            is_even = True  # Set is_even to True if we find an even number\n            break  # No need to check further, we can exit the loop\n    \n    # Return whether the product is even or not\n    return is_even\n```"
