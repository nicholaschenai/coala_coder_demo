The elements from the three lists should be interleaved, meaning we take one element from the first list, then one from the second list, and then one from the third list, and repeat this process until all elements are included.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can use a loop to iterate through the indices of the lists. For each index, we will append the corresponding elements from each of the three lists to a new list. This will ensure that the elements are interleaved correctly. We will continue this until we have processed all elements from the lists.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function interleave_lists(list1, list2, list3):\n       create an empty list called result\n       for i from 0 to length of list1 - 1:\n           append list1[i] to result\n           append list2[i] to result\n           append list3[i] to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef interleave_lists(list1, list2, list3):\n    # Create an empty list to hold the interleaved result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the indices of the lists\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        # Append the elements from each list in order\n        result.append(list1[i])\n        result.append(list2[i])\n        result.append(list3[i])\n    \n    # Return the final interleaved list\n    return result\n```"
