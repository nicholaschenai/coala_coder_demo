You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/578 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes three lists of the same length and combines them into a single list. The elements from the three lists should be interleaved, meaning we take one element from the first list, then one from the second list, and then one from the third list, and repeat this process until all elements are included.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a loop to iterate through the indices of the lists. For each index, we will append the corresponding elements from each of the three lists to a new list. This will ensure that the elements are interleaved correctly. We will continue this until we have processed all elements from the lists.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function interleave_lists(list1, list2, list3):
       create an empty list called result
       for i from 0 to length of list1 - 1:
           append list1[i] to result
           append list2[i] to result
           append list3[i] to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def interleave_lists(list1, list2, list3):
    # Create an empty list to hold the interleaved result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through the indices of the lists
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        # Append the elements from each list in order
        result.append(list1[i])
        result.append(list2[i])
        result.append(list3[i])
    
    # Return the final interleaved list
    return result
