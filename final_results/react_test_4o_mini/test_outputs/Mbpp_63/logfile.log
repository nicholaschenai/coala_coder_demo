You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find the maximum difference between available pairs in the given tuple list.
assert max_difference([(3, 5), (1, 7), (10, 3), (1, 2)]) == 7

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/63 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The goal is to find the maximum difference between the first and second elements of any tuple in the list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each tuple in the list. For each tuple, we will calculate the difference between the first and second elements. We will keep track of the maximum difference we find during this iteration. At the end, we will return the maximum difference.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_difference(tuple_list):
       initialize max_diff to 0
       for each tuple in tuple_list:
           calculate the difference as abs(tuple[0] - tuple[1])
           if difference is greater than max_diff:
               update max_diff
       return max_diff
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def max_difference(tuple_list):
    # Initialize the maximum difference to 0
    max_diff = 0
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the provided list
    for tup in tuple_list:
        # Calculate the absolute difference between the first and second elements
        difference = abs(tup[0] - tup[1])
        
        # Update max_diff if the current difference is greater
        if difference > max_diff:
            max_diff = difference
            
    # Return the maximum difference found
    return max_diff
