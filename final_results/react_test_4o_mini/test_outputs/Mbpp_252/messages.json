The polar coordinates consist of a radius (magnitude) and an angle (phase) in radians. The function should take a complex number as input and return a tuple containing these two values.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To convert a complex number to polar coordinates, we can use the following formulas:\n   - The radius (magnitude) can be calculated using the formula: \n     \\[\n     r = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n     \\]\n     where \\(a\\) is the real part and \\(b\\) is the imaginary part of the complex number.\n   - The angle (phase) can be calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\theta = \\text{atan2}(b, a)\n     \\]\n     This function computes the angle in radians based on the signs of both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function convert(complex_number):\n       a = real part of complex_number\n       b = imaginary part of complex_number\n       radius = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)\n       angle = atan2(b, a)\n       return (radius, angle)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Function to convert a complex number to polar coordinates\ndef convert(complex_number):\n    # Extract the real and imaginary parts\n    a = complex_number.real\n    b = complex_number.imag\n    \n    # Calculate the radius (magnitude)\n    radius = math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)\n    \n    # Calculate the angle (phase) in radians\n    angle = math.atan2(b, a)\n    \n    # Return the polar coordinates as a tuple\n    return (radius, angle)\n```"
