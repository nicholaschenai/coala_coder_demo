You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/252 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that converts a complex number into its polar coordinates. The polar coordinates consist of a radius (magnitude) and an angle (phase) in radians. The function should take a complex number as input and return a tuple containing these two values.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To convert a complex number to polar coordinates, we can use the following formulas:
   - The radius (magnitude) can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
     \]
     where \(a\) is the real part and \(b\) is the imaginary part of the complex number.
   - The angle (phase) can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \theta = \text{atan2}(b, a)
     \]
     This function computes the angle in radians based on the signs of both \(a\) and \(b\).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function convert(complex_number):
       a = real part of complex_number
       b = imaginary part of complex_number
       radius = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
       angle = atan2(b, a)
       return (radius, angle)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
import math

# Function to convert a complex number to polar coordinates
def convert(complex_number):
    # Extract the real and imaginary parts
    a = complex_number.real
    b = complex_number.imag
    
    # Calculate the radius (magnitude)
    radius = math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)
    
    # Calculate the angle (phase) in radians
    angle = math.atan2(b, a)
    
    # Return the polar coordinates as a tuple
    return (radius, angle)
