You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/563 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and extracts all the values that are enclosed in quotation marks. The output should be a list of these extracted values.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string and look for quotation marks. When we find an opening quotation mark, we can start collecting characters until we reach a closing quotation mark. Once we find the closing quotation mark, we can store the collected characters as a value in a list. We will continue this process until we have scanned the entire string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function extract_values(input_string):
       initialize an empty list to store results
       initialize an empty string to collect characters
       set a flag to indicate if we are inside quotes
       
       for each character in input_string:
           if character is a quotation mark:
               if we are inside quotes:
                   add the collected string to results
                   reset the collected string
                   set the flag to indicate we are outside quotes
               else:
                   set the flag to indicate we are inside quotes
           else if we are inside quotes:
               add the character to the collected string
       
       return the results list
   ```
