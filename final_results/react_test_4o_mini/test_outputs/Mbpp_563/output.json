    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and extracts all the values that are enclosed in quotation marks. The output should be a list of these extracted values.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string and look for quotation marks. When we find an opening quotation mark, we can start collecting characters until we reach a closing quotation mark. Once we find the closing quotation mark, we can store the collected characters as a value in a list. We will continue this process until we have scanned the entire string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function extract_values(input_string):\n       initialize an empty list to store results\n       initialize an empty string to collect characters\n       set a flag to indicate if we are inside quotes\n       \n       for each character in input_string:\n           if character is a quotation mark:\n               if we are inside quotes:\n                   add the collected string to results\n                   reset the collected string\n                   set the flag to indicate we are outside quotes\n               else:\n                   set the flag to indicate we are inside quotes\n           else if we are inside quotes:\n               add the character to the collected string\n       \n       return the results list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef extract_values(input_string: str) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the results\n    results = []\n    # Initialize an empty string to collect characters\n    current_value = \"\"\n    # Flag to indicate if we are inside quotes\n    inside_quotes = False\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the input string\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char == '\"':  # Check for quotation marks\n            if inside_quotes:  # If we are already inside quotes\n                results.append(current_value)  # Add the collected string to results\n                current_value = \"\"  # Reset the collected string\n                inside_quotes = False  # Set the flag to indicate we are outside quotes\n            else:  # If we are not inside quotes\n                inside_quotes = True  # Set the flag to indicate we are inside quotes\n        elif inside_quotes:  # If we are inside quotes, collect characters\n            current_value += char\n    \n    return results  # Return the list of extracted values\n```",
