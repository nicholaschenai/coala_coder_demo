You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/18 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes two strings as input. The first string contains a series of characters, and the second string contains characters that we want to remove from the first string. The function should return a new string that consists of the characters from the first string, excluding any characters that are found in the second string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the first string and check if it is present in the second string. If a character from the first string is not found in the second string, we will keep it; otherwise, we will discard it. Finally, we will join all the kept characters together to form the resulting string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function remove_dirty_chars(str1, str2):
       create an empty result string
       for each character in str1:
           if character is not in str2:
               append character to result string
       return result string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def remove_dirty_chars(str1: str, str2: str) -> str:
    # Create an empty result string to store the characters we want to keep
    result = ""
    
    # Iterate through each character in the first string
    for char in str1:
        # Check if the character is not in the second string
        if char not in str2:
            # If it's not, append it to the result string
            result += char
            
    # Return the final result string
    return result
