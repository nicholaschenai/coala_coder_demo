The first string contains a series of characters, and the second string contains characters that we want to remove from the first string. The function should return a new string that consists of the characters from the first string, excluding any characters that are found in the second string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the first string and check if it is present in the second string. If a character from the first string is not found in the second string, we will keep it; otherwise, we will discard it. Finally, we will join all the kept characters together to form the resulting string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function remove_dirty_chars(str1, str2):\n       create an empty result string\n       for each character in str1:\n           if character is not in str2:\n               append character to result string\n       return result string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef remove_dirty_chars(str1: str, str2: str) -> str:\n    # Create an empty result string to store the characters we want to keep\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the first string\n    for char in str1:\n        # Check if the character is not in the second string\n        if char not in str2:\n            # If it's not, append it to the result string\n            result += char\n            \n    # Return the final result string\n    return result\n```"
