The function should return the modified number, which will have the even bits set to 1.\n\nHere is the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef even_bit_set_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Create a mask with 1s in all even bit positions\n    mask = 0\n    for i in range(0, 32, 2):  # Assuming a 32-bit integer\n        mask |= (1 << i)  # Set the i-th bit to 1\n    # Set all even bits of n using bitwise OR\n    return n | mask\n```\n\nThis function will set all even bits of the input number `n` to 1 and return the modified number. For example, for the input `10`, the output will be `14`, as the even bits will be set to 1.",
