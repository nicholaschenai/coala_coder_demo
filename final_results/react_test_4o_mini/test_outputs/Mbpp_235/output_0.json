    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The task is to create a function that takes an integer as input and ensures that all even-numbered bits in its binary representation are set to 1. If a bit is in an even position (0, 2, 4, etc.), it should be set to 1. The function should return the modified number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we need to identify the even bits in the binary representation of the number. We can create a mask that has 1s in all even positions and 0s in all odd positions. By using a bitwise OR operation between the original number and this mask, we can set all even bits to 1 while leaving the odd bits unchanged.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `even_bit_set_number` that takes an integer `n`.\n   - Create a mask with 1s in all even positions. This can be done by initializing a variable `mask` to 0 and then using a loop to set the even bits.\n   - Use a bitwise OR operation between `n` and `mask` to set the even bits of `n`.\n   - Return the modified number.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef create_even_bit_mask():\n    # Initialize the mask to 0\n    mask = 0\n    # Set 1s in all even positions (0, 2, 4, ...)\n    for i in range(0, 32, 2):  # Assuming a 32-bit integer\n        mask |= (1 << i)  # Set the i-th bit to 1\n    return mask\n\ndef even_bit_set_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Create a mask with 1s in all even bit positions\n    mask = create_even_bit_mask()\n    # Set all even bits of n using bitwise OR\n    return n | mask\n```",
