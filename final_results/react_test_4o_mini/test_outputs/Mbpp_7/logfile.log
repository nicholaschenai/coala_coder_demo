You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find all words which are at least 4 characters long in a string.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/7 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a set of words that are at least 4 characters long. The words should be extracted from the input string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Split the input string into individual words.
   - Check the length of each word.
   - If a word has 4 or more characters, add it to a collection (like a set).
   - Finally, return the collection of words that meet the length requirement.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_char_long(input_string):
       create an empty set called result
       split input_string into words
       for each word in words:
           if length of word is greater than or equal to 4:
               add word to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def find_char_long(input_string: str) -> set:
    # Create an empty set to store the results
    result = set()
    
    # Split the input string into individual words
    words = input_string.split()
    
    # Iterate through each word in the list of words
    for word in words:
        # Check if the length of the word is at least 4 characters
        if len(word) >= 4:
            # Add the word to the result set
            result.add(word)
    
    # Return the set of words that are at least 4 characters long
    return result
