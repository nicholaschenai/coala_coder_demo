    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a set of words that are at least 4 characters long. The words should be extracted from the input string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - Split the input string into individual words.\n   - Check the length of each word.\n   - If a word has 4 or more characters, add it to a collection (like a set).\n   - Finally, return the collection of words that meet the length requirement.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function find_char_long(input_string):\n       create an empty set called result\n       split input_string into words\n       for each word in words:\n           if length of word is greater than or equal to 4:\n               add word to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef find_char_long(input_string: str) -> set:\n    # Create an empty set to store the results\n    result = set()\n    \n    # Split the input string into individual words\n    words = input_string.split()\n    \n    # Iterate through each word in the list of words\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if the length of the word is at least 4 characters\n        if len(word) >= 4:\n            # Add the word to the result set\n            result.add(word)\n    \n    # Return the set of words that are at least 4 characters long\n    return result\n```",
