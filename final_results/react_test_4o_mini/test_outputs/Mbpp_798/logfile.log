You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/798 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers (an array) as input and returns the total sum of those numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the sum of the numbers in the list, we can initialize a variable to hold the total sum, iterate through each number in the list, and add each number to the total sum. Finally, we will return the total sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function _sum(array):
       initialize total_sum to 0
       for each number in array:
           add number to total_sum
       return total_sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a helper function to calculate the sum of an array
def calculate_sum(array):
    total_sum = 0  # Initialize total sum to 0
    for number in array:  # Iterate through each number in the array
        total_sum += number  # Add the number to the total sum
    return total_sum  # Return the total sum

# Define the main function that will be called
def _sum(array):
    return calculate_sum(array)  # Call the helper function and return its result
