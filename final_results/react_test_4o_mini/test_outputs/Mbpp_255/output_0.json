    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The task is to create a function that takes a list of colors and a number `n`, and generates all possible combinations of the colors where each combination can include the same color multiple times. The function should return these combinations as a list of tuples.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To generate combinations with repetition, we can use a recursive approach. For each color in the list, we can either include it in the current combination or not, and we can repeat this process until we have formed `n` elements in the combination. We will keep track of the current combination and add it to the result once it reaches the desired length.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function combinations_helper(current_combination, start_index, n, result):\n       if length of current_combination is equal to n:\n           add current_combination as a tuple to result\n           return\n       for i from start_index to length of colors list:\n           add colors[i] to current_combination\n           call combinations_helper(current_combination, i, n, result) // allow repetition\n           remove last element from current_combination // backtrack\n\n   function combinations_colors(colors, n):\n       result = empty list\n       call combinations_helper(empty list, 0, n, result)\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef combinations_helper(current_combination, start_index, n, result):\n    # Base case: if the current combination has reached the desired length\n    if len(current_combination) == n:\n        # Add the current combination as a tuple to the result\n        result.append(tuple(current_combination))\n        return\n    \n    # Iterate through the colors starting from the current index\n    for i in range(start_index, len(colors)):\n        # Include the current color in the combination\n        current_combination.append(colors[i])\n        # Recur with the same index to allow repetition\n        combinations_helper(current_combination, i, n, result)\n        # Backtrack: remove the last added color\n        current_combination.pop()\n\ndef combinations_colors(colors, n):\n    # Initialize the result list\n    result = []\n    # Start the recursive helper function\n    combinations_helper([], 0, n, result)\n    # Return the final result\n    return result\n```",
