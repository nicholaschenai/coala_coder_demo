    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that checks if one list (the sublist) is contained within another list (the main list). The function should return `True` if the sublist is found within the main list, and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if the second list is a sublist of the first, we can iterate through the main list and check if any segment of it matches the entire sublist. We will compare slices of the main list with the sublist until we either find a match or exhaust all possibilities.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function `is_Sub_Array(main_list, sub_list)`.\n   - Get the lengths of both lists.\n   - If the length of the sublist is greater than the main list, return `False`.\n   - Loop through the main list up to the point where the remaining elements are at least as many as the sublist.\n     - For each position, check if the slice of the main list starting from that position matches the sublist.\n     - If a match is found, return `True`.\n   - If no match is found after checking all possible positions, return `False`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef is_Sub_Array(main_list, sub_list):\n    # Get the lengths of both lists\n    main_length = len(main_list)\n    sub_length = len(sub_list)\n    \n    # If the sublist is longer than the main list, it cannot be a sublist\n    if sub_length > main_length:\n        return False\n    \n    # Loop through the main list\n    for i in range(main_length - sub_length + 1):\n        # Check if the slice of the main list matches the sublist\n        if main_list[i:i + sub_length] == sub_list:\n            return True\n    \n    # If no match was found, return False\n    return False\n```",
