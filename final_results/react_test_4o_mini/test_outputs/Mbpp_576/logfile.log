INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/576 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/576 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if one list (the sublist) is contained within another list (the main list). The function should return `True` if the sublist is found within the main list, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if the second list is a sublist of the first, we can iterate through the main list and check if any segment of it matches the entire sublist. We will compare slices of the main list with the sublist until we either find a match or exhaust all possibilities.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function `is_Sub_Array(main_list, sub_list)`.
   - Get the lengths of both lists.
   - If the length of the sublist is greater than the main list, return `False`.
   - Loop through the main list up to the point where the remaining elements are at least as many as the sublist.
     - For each position, check if the slice of the main list starting from that position matches the sublist.
     - If a match is found, return `True`.
   - If no match is found after checking all possible positions, return `False`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def is_Sub_Array(main_list, sub_list):
    # Get the lengths of both lists
    main_length = len(main_list)
    sub_length = len(sub_list)
    
    # If the sublist is longer than the main list, it cannot be a sublist
    if sub_length > main_length:
        return False
    
    # Loop through the main list
    for i in range(main_length - sub_length + 1):
        # Check if the slice of the main list matches the sublist
        if main_list[i:i + sub_length] == sub_list:
            return True
    
    # If no match was found, return False
    return False
