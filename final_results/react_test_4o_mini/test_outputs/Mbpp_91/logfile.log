You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/91 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a specific substring exists within any of the strings in a given list. The function should return `True` if the substring is found in at least one of the strings, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each string in the provided list. For each string, we will check if the substring is present using the `in` keyword in Python. If we find the substring in any of the strings, we will return `True`. If we finish checking all strings without finding the substring, we will return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   FUNCTION find_substring(string_list, substring):
       FOR each string in string_list:
           IF substring is found in string:
               RETURN True
       RETURN False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def find_substring(string_list, substring):
    # Iterate through each string in the provided list
    for string in string_list:
        # Check if the substring is present in the current string
        if substring in string:
            # If found, return True
            return True
    # If the loop completes without finding the substring, return False
    return False
```
