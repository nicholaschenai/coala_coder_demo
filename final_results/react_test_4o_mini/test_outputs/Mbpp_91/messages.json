The function should return `True` if the substring is found in at least one of the strings, and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each string in the provided list. For each string, we will check if the substring is present using the `in` keyword in Python. If we find the substring in any of the strings, we will return `True`. If we finish checking all strings without finding the substring, we will return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   FUNCTION find_substring(string_list, substring):\n       FOR each string in string_list:\n           IF substring is found in string:\n               RETURN True\n       RETURN False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef find_substring(string_list, substring):\n    # Iterate through each string in the provided list\n    for string in string_list:\n        # Check if the substring is present in the current string\n        if substring in string:\n            # If found, return True\n            return True\n    # If the loop completes without finding the substring, return False\n    return False\n```"
