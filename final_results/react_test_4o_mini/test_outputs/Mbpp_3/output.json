    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that checks if a given number is not a prime number. If the number is prime, the function should return `False`, and if it is not prime, it should return `True`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if a number is not prime, we can check if it is less than 2 (since 0 and 1 are not prime), or if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. We can do this by checking for divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If we find any divisors in this range, the number is not prime.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function is_not_prime(n):\n       if n < 2:\n           return True\n       for i from 2 to sqrt(n):\n           if n is divisible by i:\n               return True\n       return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef is_not_prime(n):\n    # Check if the number is less than 2\n    if n < 2:\n        return True  # 0 and 1 are not prime numbers\n    # Check for factors from 2 to the square root of n\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return True  # Found a divisor, so n is not prime\n    return False  # No divisors found, so n is prime\n```",
