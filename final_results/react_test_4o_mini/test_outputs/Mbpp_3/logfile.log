You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/3 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given number is not a prime number. If the number is prime, the function should return `False`, and if it is not prime, it should return `True`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if a number is not prime, we can check if it is less than 2 (since 0 and 1 are not prime), or if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. We can do this by checking for divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If we find any divisors in this range, the number is not prime.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function is_not_prime(n):
       if n < 2:
           return True
       for i from 2 to sqrt(n):
           if n is divisible by i:
               return True
       return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def is_not_prime(n):
    # Check if the number is less than 2
    if n < 2:
        return True  # 0 and 1 are not prime numbers
    # Check for factors from 2 to the square root of n
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True  # Found a divisor, so n is not prime
    return False  # No divisors found, so n is prime
