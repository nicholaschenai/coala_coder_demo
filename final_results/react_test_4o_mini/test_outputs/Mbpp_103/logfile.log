You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/103 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that calculates the Eulerian number, denoted as A(n, m), which counts the number of permutations of n elements with exactly m ascents. An ascent is defined as a position in the permutation where the next element is greater than the current one.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To compute the Eulerian number A(n, m), we can use a recursive relationship based on the properties of permutations. The Eulerian numbers can be defined using the following recurrence relation:
   - A(n, 0) = 1 for all n >= 0 (there is one way to arrange n elements with no ascents).
   - A(n, n) = 0 for all n > 0 (there are no arrangements of n elements with n ascents).
   - For 0 < m < n, the relation is:
     A(n, m) = (m + 1) * A(n - 1, m) + (n - m) * A(n - 1, m - 1)
   This means that we can compute A(n, m) using previously computed values of A(n-1, m) and A(n-1, m-1).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function eulerian_num(n, m):
       if m == 0:
           return 1
       if n == m:
           return 0
       return (m + 1) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m) + (n - m) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m - 1)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def eulerian_num(n: int, m: int) -> int:
    # Base case: if m is 0, there is exactly one permutation with no ascents
    if m == 0:
        return 1
    # Base case: if n equals m, there are no permutations with n ascents
    if n == m:
        return 0
    # Recursive case: use the recurrence relation to calculate the Eulerian number
    return (m + 1) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m) + (n - m) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m - 1)
