    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The task is to create a function that calculates the Eulerian number, denoted as A(n, m), which counts the number of permutations of n elements with exactly m ascents. An ascent is defined as a position in the permutation where the next element is greater than the current one.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To compute the Eulerian number A(n, m), we can use a recursive relationship based on the properties of permutations. The Eulerian numbers can be defined using the following recurrence relation:\n   - A(n, 0) = 1 for all n >= 0 (there is one way to arrange n elements with no ascents).\n   - A(n, n) = 0 for all n > 0 (there are no arrangements of n elements with n ascents).\n   - For 0 < m < n, the relation is:\n     A(n, m) = (m + 1) * A(n - 1, m) + (n - m) * A(n - 1, m - 1)\n   This means that we can compute A(n, m) using previously computed values of A(n-1, m) and A(n-1, m-1).\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function eulerian_num(n, m):\n       if m == 0:\n           return 1\n       if n == m:\n           return 0\n       return (m + 1) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m) + (n - m) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m - 1)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef eulerian_num(n: int, m: int) -> int:\n    # Base case: if m is 0, there is exactly one permutation with no ascents\n    if m == 0:\n        return 1\n    # Base case: if n equals m, there are no permutations with n ascents\n    if n == m:\n        return 0\n    # Recursive case: use the recurrence relation to calculate the Eulerian number\n    return (m + 1) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m) + (n - m) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m - 1)\n```",
