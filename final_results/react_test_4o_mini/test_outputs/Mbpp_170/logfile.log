You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find the sum of numbers in a list within a range specified by two indices.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/170 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and two indices. The function should calculate the sum of the numbers in the list that are located between these two indices, inclusive.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Extract the sublist from the original list using the two indices provided.
   - Calculate the sum of the numbers in this sublist.
   - Return the calculated sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION sum_range_list(numbers, start_index, end_index):
       SUBLIST = numbers[start_index:end_index + 1]  // Get the sublist from start_index to end_index
       SUM = 0  // Initialize sum to 0
       FOR each number IN SUBLIST:
           SUM = SUM + number  // Add each number to the sum
       RETURN SUM  // Return the final sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def sum_range_list(numbers, start_index, end_index):
    # Get the sublist from start_index to end_index (inclusive)
    sublist = numbers[start_index:end_index + 1]
    
    # Initialize sum to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate through each number in the sublist
    for number in sublist:
        # Add each number to the total sum
        total_sum += number
    
    # Return the final sum
    return total_sum
