The circumference is the distance around the circle.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   The formula for the circumference of a circle is given by the equation \\( C = 2 \\times \\pi \\times r \\), where \\( C \\) is the circumference and \\( r \\) is the radius. We will use this formula in our function to compute the circumference based on the input radius.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function named `circle_circumference` that takes one parameter, `radius`.\n   - Inside the function, calculate the circumference using the formula \\( C = 2 \\times \\pi \\times radius \\).\n   - Return the calculated circumference.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Importing the value of pi from the math module\n# However, since we cannot use external libraries, we will define pi manually\nPI = 3.141592653589793\n\n# Function to calculate the circumference of a circle\ndef circle_circumference(radius: float) -> float:\n    # Calculate the circumference using the formula C = 2 * pi * r\n    circumference = 2 * PI * radius\n    # Return the calculated circumference\n    return circumference\n```"
