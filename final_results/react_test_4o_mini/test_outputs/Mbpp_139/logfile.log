You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/139 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the circumference of a circle given its radius. The circumference is the distance around the circle.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   The formula for the circumference of a circle is given by the equation \( C = 2 \times \pi \times r \), where \( C \) is the circumference and \( r \) is the radius. We will use this formula in our function to compute the circumference based on the input radius.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function named `circle_circumference` that takes one parameter, `radius`.
   - Inside the function, calculate the circumference using the formula \( C = 2 \times \pi \times radius \).
   - Return the calculated circumference.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:

def circle_circumference(radius: float) -> float:
    # Calculate the circumference using the formula C = 2 * pi * r
    circumference = 2 * PI * radius
