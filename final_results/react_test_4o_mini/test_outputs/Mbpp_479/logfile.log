INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/479 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/479 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a number as input and returns the first digit of that number. For example, if the input is 123, the output should be 1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the first digit of a number, we can convert the number to a string. The first character of this string will be the first digit. We can then convert this character back to an integer to return it as the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function named `first_Digit` that takes one parameter `num`.
   - Convert `num` to a string.
   - Access the first character of the string.
   - Convert this character back to an integer.
   - Return the integer.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def first_Digit(num: int) -> int:
    # Convert the number to a string to access its digits
    num_str = str(num)
    # Get the first character of the string
    first_char = num_str[0]
    # Convert the first character back to an integer
    first_digit = int(first_char)
    # Return the first digit
    return first_digit
```
