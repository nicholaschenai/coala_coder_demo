For example, if the input is 123, the output should be 1.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the first digit of a number, we can convert the number to a string. The first character of this string will be the first digit. We can then convert this character back to an integer to return it as the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function named `first_Digit` that takes one parameter `num`.\n   - Convert `num` to a string.\n   - Access the first character of the string.\n   - Convert this character back to an integer.\n   - Return the integer.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef first_Digit(num: int) -> int:\n    # Convert the number to a string to access its digits\n    num_str = str(num)\n    # Get the first character of the string\n    first_char = num_str[0]\n    # Convert the first character back to an integer\n    first_digit = int(first_char)\n    # Return the first digit\n    return first_digit\n```"
