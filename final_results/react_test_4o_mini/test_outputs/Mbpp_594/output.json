    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and finds the first even number and the first odd number in that list. Then, we will calculate the difference between the first even number and the first odd number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - We will iterate through the list of numbers.\n   - We will keep track of the first even number and the first odd number we encounter.\n   - Once we find both, we will calculate the difference by subtracting the first odd number from the first even number.\n   - If we do not find either an even or an odd number, we will handle that case appropriately.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function diff_even_odd(numbers):\n       initialize first_even to None\n       initialize first_odd to None\n       \n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is even and first_even is None:\n               set first_even to number\n           if number is odd and first_odd is None:\n               set first_odd to number\n           \n           if both first_even and first_odd are found:\n               break\n       \n       if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:\n           return first_even - first_odd\n       else:\n           return None  # or some indication that one of them was not found\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef diff_even_odd(numbers):\n    # Initialize variables to store the first even and odd numbers\n    first_even = None\n    first_odd = None\n    \n    # Iterate through the list of numbers\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is even and we haven't found an even number yet\n        if number % 2 == 0 and first_even is None:\n            first_even = number\n        # Check if the number is odd and we haven't found an odd number yet\n        if number % 2 != 0 and first_odd is None:\n            first_odd = number\n        \n        # If we have found both, we can stop searching\n        if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:\n            break\n    \n    # If both first_even and first_odd were found, return their difference\n    if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:\n        return first_even - first_odd\n    else:\n        return None  # or handle the case where one of them was not found\n```",
