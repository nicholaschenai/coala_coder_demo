INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/447 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/447 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each number is replaced by its cube (the number multiplied by itself three times).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each number in the input list, calculate its cube, and store the results in a new list. Finally, we will return this new list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function cube_nums(input_list):
       create an empty list called result
       for each number in input_list:
           calculate the cube of the number (number * number * number)
           append the cube to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def cube_nums(input_list):
    # Create an empty list to store the results
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through each number in the input list
    for number in input_list:
        # Calculate the cube of the number
        cube = number * number * number
        # Append the cube to the result list
        result.append(cube)
    
    # Return the list of cubes
    return result
