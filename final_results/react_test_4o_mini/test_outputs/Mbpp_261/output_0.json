    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes two tuples as input. Each tuple contains numbers, and we want to divide the corresponding elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple. The result should be a new tuple containing the results of these divisions.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Create a function that accepts two tuples.\n   - Iterate through the elements of both tuples simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of elements, perform the division of the first element by the second.\n   - Collect the results of these divisions into a new tuple.\n   - Return the new tuple as the output.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function division_elements(tuple1, tuple2):\n       create an empty list to store results\n       for each index in range of length of tuple1:\n           divide element at index of tuple1 by element at index of tuple2\n           append the result to the results list\n       convert results list to a tuple\n       return the tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef division_elements(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Create an empty list to store results\n    results = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the elements of both tuples simultaneously\n    for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n        # Divide the element of the first tuple by the element of the second tuple\n        result = tuple1[i] // tuple2[i]  # Using integer division\n        # Append the result to the results list\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    # Convert results list to a tuple\n    return tuple(results)\n\n```",
