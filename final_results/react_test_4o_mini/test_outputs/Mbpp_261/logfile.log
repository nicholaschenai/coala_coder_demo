You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/261 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes two tuples as input. Each tuple contains numbers, and we want to divide the corresponding elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple. The result should be a new tuple containing the results of these divisions.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Create a function that accepts two tuples.
   - Iterate through the elements of both tuples simultaneously.
   - For each pair of elements, perform the division of the first element by the second.
   - Collect the results of these divisions into a new tuple.
   - Return the new tuple as the output.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function division_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
       create an empty list to store results
       for each index in range of length of tuple1:
           divide element at index of tuple1 by element at index of tuple2
           append the result to the results list
       convert results list to a tuple
       return the tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def division_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Create an empty list to store results
    results = []
    
    # Iterate through the elements of both tuples simultaneously
    for i in range(len(tuple1)):
        # Divide the element of the first tuple by the element of the second tuple
        result = tuple1[i] // tuple2[i]  # Using integer division
        # Append the result to the results list
        results.append(result)
    
    # Convert results list to a tuple
    return tuple(results)
