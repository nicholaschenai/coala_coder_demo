    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a list of all the substrings that are enclosed in double quotation marks (\" \"). For example, if the input string is `Cortex \"A53\" Based \"multi\" tasking \"Processor\"`, the output should be a list containing the strings `['A53', 'multi', 'Processor']`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string and look for the positions of the quotation marks. When we find a quotation mark, we can start collecting characters until we reach the next quotation mark. We will store these collected characters in a list. Finally, we will return this list as the output.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function extract_quotation(input_string):\n       initialize an empty list to store results\n       initialize a variable to track if we are inside quotes (set to False)\n       initialize a variable to collect characters (set to an empty string)\n       \n       for each character in input_string:\n           if character is a quotation mark:\n               if we are inside quotes:\n                   add the collected characters to the results list\n                   reset the collected characters\n                   set inside quotes to False\n               else:\n                   set inside quotes to True\n           else if we are inside quotes:\n               add the character to the collected characters\n       \n       return the results list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef extract_quotation(input_string: str) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store results\n    results = []\n    # Variable to track if we are inside quotes\n    inside_quotes = False\n    # Variable to collect characters\n    current_string = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the input string\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char == '\"':  # Check for quotation mark\n            if inside_quotes:  # If we are already inside quotes\n                results.append(current_string)  # Add collected string to results\n                current_string = \"\"  # Reset the collected string\n                inside_quotes = False  # We are now outside quotes\n            else:  # If we are not inside quotes\n                inside_quotes = True  # We are now inside quotes\n        elif inside_quotes:  # If we are inside quotes\n            current_string += char  # Collect characters\n    \n    return results  # Return the list of collected strings\n```",
