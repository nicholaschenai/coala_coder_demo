You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to extract values between quotation marks " " of the given string.
assert extract_quotation('Cortex "A53" Based "multi" tasking "Processor"') == ['A53', 'multi', 'Processor']

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/725 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a list of all the substrings that are enclosed in double quotation marks (" "). For example, if the input string is `Cortex "A53" Based "multi" tasking "Processor"`, the output should be a list containing the strings `['A53', 'multi', 'Processor']`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string and look for the positions of the quotation marks. When we find a quotation mark, we can start collecting characters until we reach the next quotation mark. We will store these collected characters in a list. Finally, we will return this list as the output.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function extract_quotation(input_string):
       initialize an empty list to store results
       initialize a variable to track if we are inside quotes (set to False)
       initialize a variable to collect characters (set to an empty string)
       
       for each character in input_string:
           if character is a quotation mark:
               if we are inside quotes:
                   add the collected characters to the results list
                   reset the collected characters
                   set inside quotes to False
               else:
                   set inside quotes to True
           else if we are inside quotes:
               add the character to the collected characters
       
       return the results list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:

def extract_quotation(input_string: str) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to store results
