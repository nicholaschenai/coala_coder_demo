You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/459 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and removes all uppercase letters from it. The result should be a new string that contains only the lowercase letters and any other characters that were not uppercase.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the input string. For each character, we will check if it is an uppercase letter. If it is not uppercase, we will add it to a new string. Finally, we will return the new string that contains only the non-uppercase characters.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function remove_uppercase(input_string):
       create an empty string result
       for each character in input_string:
           if character is not uppercase:
               append character to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def remove_uppercase(input_string: str) -> str:
    # Create an empty string to store the result
    result = ""
    
    # Iterate through each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # Check if the character is not uppercase
        if not char.isupper():
            # Append the character to the result string
            result += char
            
    # Return the final result string
    return result
