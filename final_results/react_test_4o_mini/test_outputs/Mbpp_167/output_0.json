    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a non-negative integer `n` and returns the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n`. For example, if `n` is 0, the function should return 1, since 2^0 = 1 is the smallest power of 2.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n`, we can start with the smallest power of 2 (which is 1) and keep multiplying by 2 until we reach or exceed `n`. We can use a loop to achieve this, starting from 1 and doubling the value until it is no longer less than `n`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function next_power_of_2(n):\n       if n is 0:\n           return 1\n       power = 1\n       while power < n:\n           power = power * 2\n       return power\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef next_power_of_2(n: int) -> int:\n    # If n is 0, the smallest power of 2 is 1\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Start with the smallest power of 2\n    power = 1\n    \n    # Keep doubling the power until it is greater than or equal to n\n    while power < n:\n        power *= 2\n    \n    # Return the found power of 2\n    return power\n```",
