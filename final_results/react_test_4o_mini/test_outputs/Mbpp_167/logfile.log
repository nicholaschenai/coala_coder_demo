You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/167 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a non-negative integer `n` and returns the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n`. For example, if `n` is 0, the function should return 1, since 2^0 = 1 is the smallest power of 2.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n`, we can start with the smallest power of 2 (which is 1) and keep multiplying by 2 until we reach or exceed `n`. We can use a loop to achieve this, starting from 1 and doubling the value until it is no longer less than `n`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function next_power_of_2(n):
       if n is 0:
           return 1
       power = 1
       while power < n:
           power = power * 2
       return power
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def next_power_of_2(n: int) -> int:
    # If n is 0, the smallest power of 2 is 1
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    
    # Start with the smallest power of 2
    power = 1
    
    # Keep doubling the power until it is greater than or equal to n
    while power < n:
        power *= 2
    
    # Return the found power of 2
    return power
