    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the smallest number from that list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the smallest number in a list, we can start by assuming the first number in the list is the smallest. Then, we will iterate through the rest of the numbers in the list, comparing each one to our current smallest number. If we find a number that is smaller, we will update our smallest number. At the end of the iteration, we will return the smallest number we found.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function smallest_num(numbers):\n       if numbers is empty:\n           return None\n       set smallest to numbers[0]\n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number < smallest:\n               set smallest to number\n       return smallest\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef smallest_num(numbers):\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if not numbers:\n        return None  # Return None if the list is empty\n    # Assume the first number is the smallest\n    smallest = numbers[0]\n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # If the current number is smaller than the smallest found so far\n        if number < smallest:\n            # Update smallest\n            smallest = number\n    # Return the smallest number found\n    return smallest\n```",
