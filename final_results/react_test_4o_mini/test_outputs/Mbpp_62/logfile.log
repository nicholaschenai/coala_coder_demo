You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/62 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the smallest number from that list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the smallest number in a list, we can start by assuming the first number in the list is the smallest. Then, we will iterate through the rest of the numbers in the list, comparing each one to our current smallest number. If we find a number that is smaller, we will update our smallest number. At the end of the iteration, we will return the smallest number we found.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function smallest_num(numbers):
       if numbers is empty:
           return None
       set smallest to numbers[0]
       for each number in numbers:
           if number < smallest:
               set smallest to number
       return smallest
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def smallest_num(numbers):
    # Check if the list is empty
    if not numbers:
        return None  # Return None if the list is empty
    # Assume the first number is the smallest
    smallest = numbers[0]
    # Iterate through each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # If the current number is smaller than the smallest found so far
        if number < smallest:
            # Update smallest
            smallest = number
    # Return the smallest number found
    return smallest
```
