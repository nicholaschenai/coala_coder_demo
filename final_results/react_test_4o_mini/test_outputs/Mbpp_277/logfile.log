You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/277 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a dictionary where the keys are names and the values are integers. The function should return a new dictionary that only includes the entries where the integer values are greater than or equal to a specified integer `n`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each key-value pair in the input dictionary. For each pair, we will check if the value is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, we will add that key-value pair to a new dictionary. Finally, we will return the new dictionary that contains only the filtered entries.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function dict_filter(input_dict, n):
       create an empty dictionary called filtered_dict
       for each key, value in input_dict:
           if value >= n:
               add key and value to filtered_dict
       return filtered_dict
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def dict_filter(input_dict, n):
    # Create an empty dictionary to store filtered results
    filtered_dict = {}
    
    # Iterate through each key-value pair in the input dictionary
    for key, value in input_dict.items():
        # Check if the value is greater than or equal to n
        if value >= n:
            # Add the key-value pair to the filtered dictionary
            filtered_dict[key] = value
            
    # Return the filtered dictionary
