The function should return a new dictionary that only includes the entries where the integer values are greater than or equal to a specified integer `n`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each key-value pair in the input dictionary. For each pair, we will check if the value is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, we will add that key-value pair to a new dictionary. Finally, we will return the new dictionary that contains only the filtered entries.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function dict_filter(input_dict, n):\n       create an empty dictionary called filtered_dict\n       for each key, value in input_dict:\n           if value >= n:\n               add key and value to filtered_dict\n       return filtered_dict\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef dict_filter(input_dict, n):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store filtered results\n    filtered_dict = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through each key-value pair in the input dictionary\n    for key, value in input_dict.items():\n        # Check if the value is greater than or equal to n\n        if value >= n:\n            # Add the key-value pair to the filtered dictionary\n            filtered_dict[key] = value\n            \n    # Return the filtered dictionary\n    return filtered_dict\n```"
