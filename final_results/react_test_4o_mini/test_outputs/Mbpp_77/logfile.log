You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/77 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given number is divisible by 11. The function should return `True` if the number is divisible by 11 and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if a number is divisible by 11, we can use the modulus operator (`%`). If the number modulo 11 equals 0, then the number is divisible by 11. Otherwise, it is not.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Function is_Diff(number):
       If number % 11 equals 0:
           Return True
       Else:
           Return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to check if a number is divisible by 11
def is_Diff(number):
    # Check if the number modulo 11 is 0
    if number % 11 == 0:
        return True  # The number is divisible by 11
    else:
        return False  # The number is not divisible by 11
