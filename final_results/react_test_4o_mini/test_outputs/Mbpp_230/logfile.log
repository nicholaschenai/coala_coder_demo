INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/230 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function that takes in a string and character, replaces blank spaces in the string with the character, and returns the string.
assert replace_blank("hello people",'@')==("hello@people")

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/230 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that takes a string and a character as inputs. The function should replace all spaces in the string with the specified character and then return the modified string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the input string. Whenever we encounter a space, we will replace it with the given character. We can build a new string with these modifications and return it at the end.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Function replace_blank(input_string, replacement_char):
       Initialize an empty result string
       For each character in input_string:
           If the character is a space:
               Append replacement_char to result string
           Else:
               Append the character to result string
       Return result string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def replace_blank(input_string: str, replacement_char: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty result string
    result = ""
    
    # Iterate through each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # If the character is a space, append the replacement character
        if char == ' ':
            result += replacement_char
        else:
            # Otherwise, append the original character
            result += char
            
    # Return the modified string
    return result
