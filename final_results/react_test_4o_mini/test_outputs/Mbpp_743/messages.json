        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a list and a number as inputs. The function should rotate the elements of the list to the right by the specified number of positions. For example, if we have a list of numbers and we want to rotate it by 3 positions to the right, the last three elements of the list should move to the front, and the rest of the elements should shift to the right.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To rotate the list to the right, we can use the following approach:\n   - First, determine the effective number of rotations needed. If the number of rotations is greater than the length of the list, we can use the modulus operator to find the equivalent smaller number of rotations.\n   - Next, we can split the list into two parts: the last 'n' elements (where 'n' is the number of rotations) and the rest of the list.\n   - Finally, we concatenate these two parts to form the rotated list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function rotate_right(lst, n):\n       length = length of lst\n       if length is 0:\n           return lst\n       n = n % length  // effective rotations\n       if n is 0:\n           return lst\n       part1 = last n elements of lst\n       part2 = first (length - n) elements of lst\n       return part1 + part2\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef rotate_right(lst, n):\n    # Get the length of the list\n    length = len(lst)\n    \n    # If the list is empty, return it as is\n    if length == 0:\n        return lst\n    \n    # Calculate effective rotations needed\n    n = n % length\n    \n    # If no rotations are needed, return the original list\n    if n == 0:\n        return lst\n    \n    # Split the list into two parts\n    part1 = lst[-n:]  # Last n elements\n    part2 = lst[:-n]  # All elements except the last n\n    \n    # Concatenate the two parts and return the result\n    return part1 + part2\n```"
