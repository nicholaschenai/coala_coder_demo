You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/743 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list and a number as inputs. The function should rotate the elements of the list to the right by the specified number of positions. For example, if we have a list of numbers and we want to rotate it by 3 positions to the right, the last three elements of the list should move to the front, and the rest of the elements should shift to the right.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To rotate the list to the right, we can use the following approach:
   - First, determine the effective number of rotations needed. If the number of rotations is greater than the length of the list, we can use the modulus operator to find the equivalent smaller number of rotations.
   - Next, we can split the list into two parts: the last 'n' elements (where 'n' is the number of rotations) and the rest of the list.
   - Finally, we concatenate these two parts to form the rotated list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function rotate_right(lst, n):
       length = length of lst
       if length is 0:
           return lst
       n = n % length  // effective rotations
       if n is 0:
           return lst
       part1 = last n elements of lst
       part2 = first (length - n) elements of lst
       return part1 + part2
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def rotate_right(lst, n):
    # Get the length of the list
    length = len(lst)
    
    # If the list is empty, return it as is
    if length == 0:
        return lst
    
    # Calculate effective rotations needed
    n = n % length
    
    # If no rotations are needed, return the original list
    if n == 0:
        return lst
    
    # Split the list into two parts
    part1 = lst[-n:]  # Last n elements
    part2 = lst[:-n]  # All elements except the last n
    
    # Concatenate the two parts and return the result
    return part1 + part2
