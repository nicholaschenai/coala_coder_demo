You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/619 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and rearranges it so that all the numeric characters (0-9) are moved to the end of the string, while keeping the order of the non-numeric characters and the numeric characters themselves intact.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the input string. We will maintain two separate lists: one for non-numeric characters and another for numeric characters. As we go through the string, we will check if each character is a digit or not. If it is a digit, we will add it to the numeric list; if it is not, we will add it to the non-numeric list. Finally, we will concatenate the non-numeric list with the numeric list to form the final string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function move_num(input_string):
       create an empty list for non_numeric
       create an empty list for numeric
       for each character in input_string:
           if character is a digit:
               add character to numeric list
           else:
               add character to non_numeric list
       concatenate non_numeric list with numeric list
       return the concatenated string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def move_num(input_string: str) -> str:
    # Create empty lists to hold non-numeric and numeric characters
    non_numeric = []
    numeric = []
    
    # Iterate through each character in the input string

            # If it is not a digit, add it to the non-numeric list
            non_numeric.append(char)
