You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/125 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a binary string (a string made up of '0's and '1's) and finds the maximum difference between the count of '0's and '1's in any substring of that binary string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible substrings of the given binary string. For each substring, we will count the number of '0's and '1's, calculate the difference between these counts, and keep track of the maximum difference found. The difference can be calculated as the count of '0's minus the count of '1's.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_length(binary_string):
       max_difference = 0
       for start_index from 0 to length of binary_string - 1:
           for end_index from start_index to length of binary_string:
               substring = binary_string[start_index:end_index]
               count_0 = count of '0's in substring
               count_1 = count of '1's in substring
               difference = count_0 - count_1
               if difference > max_difference:
                   max_difference = difference
       return max_difference
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def find_length(binary_string: str) -> int:
