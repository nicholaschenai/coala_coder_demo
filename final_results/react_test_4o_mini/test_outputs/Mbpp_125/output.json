    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a binary string (a string made up of '0's and '1's) and finds the maximum difference between the count of '0's and '1's in any substring of that binary string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible substrings of the given binary string. For each substring, we will count the number of '0's and '1's, calculate the difference between these counts, and keep track of the maximum difference found. The difference can be calculated as the count of '0's minus the count of '1's.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function find_length(binary_string):\n       max_difference = 0\n       for start_index from 0 to length of binary_string - 1:\n           for end_index from start_index to length of binary_string:\n               substring = binary_string[start_index:end_index]\n               count_0 = count of '0's in substring\n               count_1 = count of '1's in substring\n               difference = count_0 - count_1\n               if difference > max_difference:\n                   max_difference = difference\n       return max_difference\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef find_length(binary_string: str) -> int:\n    # Initialize the maximum difference to 0\n    max_difference = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over all possible starting points for substrings\n    for start_index in range(len(binary_string)):\n        # Initialize counts of '0's and '1's for the current substring\n        count_0 = 0\n        count_1 = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over all possible ending points for substrings\n        for end_index in range(start_index, len(binary_string)):\n            # Count '0's and '1's in the current substring\n            if binary_string[end_index] == '0':\n                count_0 += 1\n            else:\n                count_1 += 1\n            \n            # Calculate the difference between counts of '0's and '1's\n            difference = count_0 - count_1\n            \n            # Update the maximum difference if the current one is greater\n            if difference > max_difference:\n                max_difference = difference\n    \n    # Return the maximum difference found\n    return max_difference\n```",
