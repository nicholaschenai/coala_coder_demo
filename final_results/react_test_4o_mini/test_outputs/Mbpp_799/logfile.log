You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/799 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a number and rotates its bits to the left by a specified number of positions. The number is treated as a 32-bit integer.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To rotate the bits of a number to the left, we can shift the bits to the left by the specified number of positions. If the bits that are shifted out of the left end exceed the 32-bit limit, they should wrap around to the right end of the number. We can achieve this by using bitwise operations.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function `left_rotate(num, d)`.
   - Calculate the effective number of rotations needed by taking `d % 32` (since rotating by 32 or more would return the number to its original state).
   - Shift the number `num` to the left by `d` positions.
   - Shift the number `num` to the right by `(32 - d)` positions to get the bits that overflowed.
   - Combine the two results using a bitwise OR operation.
   - Return the result, ensuring it fits within 32 bits by applying a mask of `0xFFFFFFFF`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def left_rotate(num: int, d: int) -> int:
    # Calculate effective rotations
    d = d % 32
    
    # Shift left and wrap around the bits that overflow
    left_shifted = (num << d) & 0xFFFFFFFF  # Shift left and mask to 32 bits
    right_shifted = (num >> (32 - d)) & 0xFFFFFFFF  # Shift right to get overflow bits
    
    # Combine the two results
    result = left_shifted | right_shifted
    
    return result
```
