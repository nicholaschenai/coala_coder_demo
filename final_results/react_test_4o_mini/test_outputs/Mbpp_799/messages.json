The number is treated as a 32-bit integer.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To rotate the bits of a number to the left, we can shift the bits to the left by the specified number of positions. If the bits that are shifted out of the left end exceed the 32-bit limit, they should wrap around to the right end of the number. We can achieve this by using bitwise operations.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function `left_rotate(num, d)`.\n   - Calculate the effective number of rotations needed by taking `d % 32` (since rotating by 32 or more would return the number to its original state).\n   - Shift the number `num` to the left by `d` positions.\n   - Shift the number `num` to the right by `(32 - d)` positions to get the bits that overflowed.\n   - Combine the two results using a bitwise OR operation.\n   - Return the result, ensuring it fits within 32 bits by applying a mask of `0xFFFFFFFF`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef left_rotate(num: int, d: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate effective rotations\n    d = d % 32\n    \n    # Shift left and wrap around the bits that overflow\n    left_shifted = (num << d) & 0xFFFFFFFF  # Shift left and mask to 32 bits\n    right_shifted = (num >> (32 - d)) & 0xFFFFFFFF  # Shift right to get overflow bits\n    \n    # Combine the two results\n    result = left_shifted | right_shifted\n    \n    return result\n```"
