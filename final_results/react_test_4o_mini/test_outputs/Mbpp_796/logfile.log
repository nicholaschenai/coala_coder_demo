INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/796 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write function to find the sum of all items in the given dictionary.
assert return_sum({'a': 100, 'b':200, 'c':300}) == 600

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/796 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a dictionary as input, where the keys are strings and the values are integers. The function should calculate and return the total sum of all the integer values in the dictionary.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the values of the dictionary and keep a running total of these values. At the end of the iteration, we will return the total sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function return_sum(dictionary):
       initialize total_sum to 0
       for each value in dictionary:
           add value to total_sum
       return total_sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def return_sum(dictionary):
    # Initialize a variable to hold the total sum
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate through each value in the dictionary
    for value in dictionary.values():
        # Add the current value to the total sum
        total_sum += value
    
    # Return the total sum of all values
    return total_sum
