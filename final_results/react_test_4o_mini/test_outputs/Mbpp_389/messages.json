The Lucas numbers are a sequence similar to the Fibonacci numbers, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, but they start with 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the n-th Lucas number, we can use a recursive approach or an iterative approach. The base cases are:\n   - L(0) = 2\n   - L(1) = 1\n   For n greater than 1, the n-th Lucas number can be calculated as:\n   - L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)\n   We can use a loop to calculate the value iteratively to avoid the overhead of recursion.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_lucas(n):\n       if n == 0:\n           return 2\n       if n == 1:\n           return 1\n       initialize first = 2\n       initialize second = 1\n       for i from 2 to n:\n           next = first + second\n           first = second\n           second = next\n       return second\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_lucas(n):\n    # Base case for the 0th Lucas number\n    if n == 0:\n        return 2\n    # Base case for the 1st Lucas number\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize the first two Lucas numbers\n    first = 2  # L(0)\n    second = 1  # L(1)\n    \n    # Calculate the n-th Lucas number iteratively\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        next = first + second  # L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)\n        first = second  # Move to the next number in the sequence\n        second = next  # Update the second number to the new calculated value\n    \n    return second  # Return the n-th Lucas number\n```"
