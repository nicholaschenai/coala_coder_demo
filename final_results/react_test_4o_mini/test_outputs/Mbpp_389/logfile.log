You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/389 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are a sequence similar to the Fibonacci numbers, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, but they start with 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the n-th Lucas number, we can use a recursive approach or an iterative approach. The base cases are:
   - L(0) = 2
   - L(1) = 1
   For n greater than 1, the n-th Lucas number can be calculated as:
   - L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)
   We can use a loop to calculate the value iteratively to avoid the overhead of recursion.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_lucas(n):
       if n == 0:
           return 2
       if n == 1:
           return 1
       initialize first = 2
       initialize second = 1
       for i from 2 to n:
           next = first + second
           first = second
           second = next
       return second
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def find_lucas(n):
    # Base case for the 0th Lucas number
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    # Base case for the 1st Lucas number
    if n == 1:

    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        next = first + second  # L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)
        first = second  # Move to the next number in the sequence
        second = next  # Update the second number to the new calculated value
    
    return second  # Return the n-th Lucas number
