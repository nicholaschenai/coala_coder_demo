If there are multiple items with the same maximum frequency, we will return the first one that reaches that frequency.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each item in the list. We will iterate through the list, updating the count for each item in the dictionary. After counting, we will determine which item has the highest count and return that item.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function max_occurrences(input_list):\n       create an empty dictionary to store counts\n       for each item in input_list:\n           if item is not in dictionary:\n               add item to dictionary with count 1\n           else:\n               increment the count of item in dictionary\n       \n       initialize max_count to 0 and max_item to None\n       for each item and count in dictionary:\n           if count is greater than max_count:\n               update max_count to count\n               update max_item to item\n       \n       return max_item\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef max_occurrences(input_list):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store counts\n    counts = {}\n    \n    # Count occurrences of each item in the input list\n    for item in input_list:\n        if item not in counts:\n            counts[item] = 1  # Initialize count to 1\n        else:\n            counts[item] += 1  # Increment count\n    \n    # Initialize variables to track the item with maximum frequency\n    max_count = 0\n    max_item = None\n    \n    # Find the item with the maximum count\n    for item, count in counts.items():\n        if count > max_count:\n            max_count = count  # Update max_count\n            max_item = item    # Update max_item\n    \n    return max_item  # Return the item with maximum frequency\n```"
