You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/130 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of items and returns the item that appears most frequently in that list. If there are multiple items with the same maximum frequency, we will return the first one that reaches that frequency.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each item in the list. We will iterate through the list, updating the count for each item in the dictionary. After counting, we will determine which item has the highest count and return that item.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_occurrences(input_list):
       create an empty dictionary to store counts
       for each item in input_list:
           if item is not in dictionary:
               add item to dictionary with count 1
           else:
               increment the count of item in dictionary
       
       initialize max_count to 0 and max_item to None
       for each item and count in dictionary:
           if count is greater than max_count:
               update max_count to count
               update max_item to item
       
       return max_item
   ```
