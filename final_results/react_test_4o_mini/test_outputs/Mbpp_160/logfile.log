You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function that returns integers x and y that satisfy ax + by = n as a tuple, or return None if no solution exists.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/160 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to find two integers, x and y, such that when we multiply x by a given integer 'a' and y by another integer 'b', and then add the two results together, we get a third integer 'n'. If such integers exist, we return them as a tuple; if not, we return None.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve the equation ax + by = n, we can iterate through possible values of x and calculate the corresponding value of y. For each x, we can rearrange the equation to find y: y = (n - ax) / b. We need to check if y is an integer and if both x and y are non-negative. If we find such a pair, we return it; if we exhaust all possibilities without finding a solution, we return None.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_solution(a, b, n):
       for x from 0 to n // a:
           calculate y as (n - a * x) / b
           if y is an integer and y >= 0:
               return (x, y)
       return None
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def find_solution(a: int, b: int, n: int) -> tuple[int, int] | None:
    # Iterate through possible values of x
    for x in range(n // a + 1):
        # Calculate the corresponding value of y
        if (n - a * x) % b == 0:  # Check if (n - ax) is divisible by b
            y = (n - a * x) // b
            if y >= 0:  # Ensure y is non-negative
                return (x, y)  # Return the solution as a tuple
    return None  # Return None if no solution is found
