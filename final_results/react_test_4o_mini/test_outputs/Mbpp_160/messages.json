If such integers exist, we return them as a tuple; if not, we return None.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve the equation ax + by = n, we can iterate through possible values of x and calculate the corresponding value of y. For each x, we can rearrange the equation to find y: y = (n - ax) / b. We need to check if y is an integer and if both x and y are non-negative. If we find such a pair, we return it; if we exhaust all possibilities without finding a solution, we return None.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_solution(a, b, n):\n       for x from 0 to n // a:\n           calculate y as (n - a * x) / b\n           if y is an integer and y >= 0:\n               return (x, y)\n       return None\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_solution(a: int, b: int, n: int) -> tuple[int, int] | None:\n    # Iterate through possible values of x\n    for x in range(n // a + 1):\n        # Calculate the corresponding value of y\n        if (n - a * x) % b == 0:  # Check if (n - ax) is divisible by b\n            y = (n - a * x) // b\n            if y >= 0:  # Ensure y is non-negative\n                return (x, y)  # Return the solution as a tuple\n    return None  # Return None if no solution is found\n```"
