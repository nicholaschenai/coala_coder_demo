This dictionary should map each unique tuple to the number of times it appears in the input list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of tuples and keep track of how many times each tuple appears. We can use a dictionary to store the tuples as keys and their counts as values. For each tuple in the list, we will check if it is already in the dictionary. If it is, we will increment its count; if it is not, we will add it to the dictionary with a count of 1. Finally, we will return the dictionary.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function check_occurences(tuples_list):\n       create an empty dictionary called occurrences\n       for each tuple in tuples_list:\n           if tuple is in occurrences:\n               increment occurrences[tuple] by 1\n           else:\n               set occurrences[tuple] to 1\n       return occurrences\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef check_occurences(tuples_list):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store occurrences\n    occurrences = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the input list\n    for tup in tuples_list:\n        # Check if the tuple is already in the dictionary\n        if tup in occurrences:\n            # Increment the count for this tuple\n            occurrences[tup] += 1\n        else:\n            # Add the tuple to the dictionary with a count of 1\n            occurrences[tup] = 1\n            \n    # Return the dictionary containing the counts of each tuple\n    return occurrences\n```"

This means that the function should count occurrences of tuples, but it seems that the expected output is not simply counting the occurrences of the tuples as they appear in the list.\n\n2. **Identifying the Mistake:**\n   In the original code, I was counting how many times each tuple appeared in the list. However, the expected output suggests that the function should return a dictionary that only includes tuples that have a specific relationship or condition, rather than just counting occurrences.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Input:**\n   The input list contains tuples that can be considered as pairs. The expected output seems to indicate that we should only include tuples that are \"related\" in some way. Specifically, it looks like the output is counting pairs that are reverses of each other (e.g., `(3, 1)` and `(1, 3)`).\n\n4. **Revising the Approach:**\n   To achieve the expected output, I need to:\n   - Count occurrences of each tuple and its reverse.\n   - Only include tuples in the output dictionary if they have a corresponding reverse tuple that also appears in the list.\n\n5. **New Plan:**\n   - Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each tuple.\n   - Create another dictionary to store the final result.\n   - For each tuple, check if its reverse exists in the count dictionary.\n   - If both the tuple and its reverse exist, add them to the result dictionary with the appropriate counts.\n\nNow, I will implement this revised approach in the code. \n\n```python\ndef check_occurences(tuples_list):\n    # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each tuple\n    occurrences = {}\n    \n    # Count occurrences of each tuple\n    for tup in tuples_list:\n        if tup in occurrences:\n            occurrences[tup] += 1\n        else:\n            occurrences[tup] = 1\n            \n    # Create a dictionary to store the result\n    result = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through the counted occurrences\n    for tup in occurrences:\n        # Check for the reverse tuple\n        reverse_tup = (tup[1], tup[0])\n        if reverse_tup in occurrences:\n            # Add to result with the minimum count of the tuple and its reverse\n            result[tup] = occurrences[tup] + occurrences[reverse_tup]\n    \n    # Return the result dictionary\n    return result\n```"
