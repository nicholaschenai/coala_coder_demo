You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to find the sum of even numbers at even positions of a list.
assert sum_even_and_even_index([5, 6, 12, 1, 18, 8]) == 30

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/270 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of even numbers that are located at even indices in a given list of numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through the list of numbers.
   - For each number, we will check if its index is even (0, 2, 4, etc.).
   - If the index is even, we will then check if the number itself is even.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, we will add that number to a running total.
   - Finally, we will return the total sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sum_even_and_even_index(numbers):
       initialize total_sum to 0
       for index from 0 to length of numbers - 1:
           if index is even:
               if numbers[index] is even:
                   add numbers[index] to total_sum
       return total_sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def sum_even_and_even_index(numbers):
    # Initialize the total sum to 0
    total_sum = 0

        # Check if the index is even
        if index % 2 == 0:
            # Check if the number at that index is even
            if numbers[index] % 2 == 0:
                # Add the even number at even index to the total sum
                total_sum += numbers[index]
    
    # Return the total sum of even numbers at even indices
    return total_sum
