    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of even numbers that are located at even indices in a given list of numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate through the list of numbers.\n   - For each number, we will check if its index is even (0, 2, 4, etc.).\n   - If the index is even, we will then check if the number itself is even.\n   - If both conditions are satisfied, we will add that number to a running total.\n   - Finally, we will return the total sum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function sum_even_and_even_index(numbers):\n       initialize total_sum to 0\n       for index from 0 to length of numbers - 1:\n           if index is even:\n               if numbers[index] is even:\n                   add numbers[index] to total_sum\n       return total_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef sum_even_and_even_index(numbers):\n    # Initialize the total sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the list with index\n    for index in range(len(numbers)):\n        # Check if the index is even\n        if index % 2 == 0:\n            # Check if the number at that index is even\n            if numbers[index] % 2 == 0:\n                # Add the even number at even index to the total sum\n                total_sum += numbers[index]\n    \n    # Return the total sum of even numbers at even indices\n    return total_sum\n```",
