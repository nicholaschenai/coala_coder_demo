You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/56 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: We need to create a function that checks if a given number is equal to one less than twice the number formed by reversing its digits.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - First, we will reverse the digits of the given number.
   - Then, we will calculate twice the reversed number and subtract one from it.
   - Finally, we will check if this result is equal to the original number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function check(number):
       reverse_number = reverse the digits of number
       calculated_value = (2 * reverse_number) - 1
       return calculated_value == number
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def reverse_number(n):
    # This function reverses the digits of the number n
    reversed_num = 0
    while n > 0:
        reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + n % 10
        n //= 10
    return reversed_num

def check(number: int) -> bool:
    # Reverse the digits of the number
    reversed_num = reverse_number(number)
    # Calculate twice the reversed number minus one
    calculated_value = (2 * reversed_num) - 1
    # Check if the calculated value is equal to the original number
    return calculated_value == number
