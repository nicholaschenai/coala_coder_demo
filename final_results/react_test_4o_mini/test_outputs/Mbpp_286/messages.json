        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes an array of integers and a number `k`. The function should repeat the array `k` times to form a new array and then find the largest sum of any contiguous subarray within this new array.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can use a modified version of Kadane's algorithm, which is typically used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray. Since the array is repeated `k` times, we need to consider the effects of wrapping around the end of the original array. We can calculate the maximum subarray sum for:\n   - The original array.\n   - The original array repeated twice (to account for wrapping).\n   - The case where the sum of the entire original array is positive, allowing us to consider the contribution of additional full arrays when `k` is greater than 2.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function max_sub_array_sum_repeated(arr, n, k):\n       if k == 0:\n           return 0\n       if k == 1:\n           return max_sub_array_sum(arr)\n       \n       max_sum = max_sub_array_sum(arr)\n       total_sum = sum(arr)\n       \n       if total_sum > 0:\n           max_sum = max(max_sum, max_sub_array_sum(arr + arr) + (k - 2) * total_sum)\n       else:\n           max_sum = max(max_sum, max_sub_array_sum(arr + arr))\n       \n       return max_sum\n\n   function max_sub_array_sum(arr):\n       current_max = arr[0]\n       global_max = arr[0]\n       for each number in arr:\n           current_max = max(number, current_max + number)\n           global_max = max(global_max, current_max)\n       return global_max\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef max_sub_array_sum(arr):\n    # Initialize current and global maximums\n    current_max = arr[0]\n    global_max = arr[0]\n    \n    # Iterate through the array to find the maximum subarray sum\n    for number in arr[1:]:\n        current_max = max(number, current_max + number)  # Update current max\n        global_max = max(global_max, current_max)  # Update global max if needed\n    \n    return global_max\n\ndef max_sub_array_sum_repeated(arr, n, k):\n    # Handle edge case where k is 0\n    if k == 0:\n        return 0\n    # If k is 1, just find the max subarray sum of the original array\n    if k == 1:\n        return max_sub_array_sum(arr)\n    \n    # Calculate the maximum subarray sum of the original array\n    max_sum = max_sub_array_sum(arr)\n    # Calculate the total sum of the original array\n    total_sum = sum(arr)\n    \n    # If the total sum is positive, consider the contribution of additional full arrays\n    if total_sum > 0:\n        max_sum = max(max_sum, max_sub_array_sum(arr + arr) + (k - 2) * total_sum)\n    else:\n        # If total sum is not positive, just consider the max subarray sum of the doubled array\n        max_sum = max(max_sum, max_sub_array_sum(arr + arr))\n    \n    return max_sum\n```"
