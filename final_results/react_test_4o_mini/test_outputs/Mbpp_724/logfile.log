You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function that takes base and power as arguments and calculate the sum of all digits of the base to the specified power.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/724 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes two numbers: a base and a power. The function will calculate the base raised to the power, then sum all the digits of the resulting number.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - First, we will calculate the result of raising the base to the specified power.
   - Next, we will convert this result into a string to easily access each digit.
   - We will then iterate through each character in the string, convert it back to an integer, and sum these integers to get the final result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function power_base_sum(base, power):
       result = base raised to the power
       convert result to string
       initialize sum to 0
       for each character in the string representation of result:
           convert character to integer
           add integer to sum
       return sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def power_base_sum(base: int, power: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the result of base raised to the power
    result = base ** power
    
    # Convert the result to a string to iterate over each digit
    result_str = str(result)
    
    # Initialize a variable to hold the sum of the digits
    digit_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string representation of the result
    for char in result_str:
        # Convert the character back to an integer and add to the sum
        digit_sum += int(char)
    
    # Return the final sum of the digits
    return digit_sum
