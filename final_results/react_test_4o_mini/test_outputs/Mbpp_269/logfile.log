INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/269 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/269 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a single character as input and returns its corresponding ASCII value.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the ASCII value of a character, we can use Python's built-in `ord()` function, which converts a character to its ASCII integer value. The function will take one character as input and return the result of `ord()` applied to that character.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION ascii_value(character):
       RETURN ord(character)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function that takes a single character as input
def ascii_value(character: str) -> int:
    # Use the built-in ord() function to get the ASCII value of the character
    return ord(character)
```
