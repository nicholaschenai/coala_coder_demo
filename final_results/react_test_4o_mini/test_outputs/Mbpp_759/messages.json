The function should return `True` if the string meets this criterion and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To determine if a string is a valid decimal number with two decimal places, we can:\n   - Check if the string contains exactly one decimal point.\n   - Ensure that there are exactly two digits following the decimal point.\n   - Verify that the characters before the decimal point are digits (or can be empty if the number is less than 1).\n   - Handle cases where the string might be negative by allowing a leading '-' sign.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function is_decimal(s: string) -> bool:\n       if s is empty:\n           return False\n       if s starts with '-' or '+' (optional):\n           remove the sign\n       split s by '.' into parts\n       if length of parts is not 2:\n           return False\n       if length of parts[0] is not valid (not all digits):\n           return False\n       if length of parts[1] is not 2:\n           return False\n       if parts[1] is not valid (not all digits):\n           return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef is_decimal(s: str) -> bool:\n    # Check if the string is empty\n    if not s:\n        return False\n    \n    # Handle optional leading sign\n    if s[0] in ('-', '+'):\n        s = s[1:]  # Remove the sign for further checks\n    \n    # Split the string by the decimal point\n    parts = s.split('.')\n    \n    # Check if there is exactly one decimal point\n    if len(parts) != 2:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if the part before the decimal point is valid (digits only)\n    if not parts[0].isdigit() and parts[0] != '':\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if the part after the decimal point has exactly two digits\n    if len(parts[1]) != 2 or not parts[1].isdigit():\n        return False\n    \n    # If all checks passed, return True\n    return True\n```"
