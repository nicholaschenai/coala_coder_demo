You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/267 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, the first two odd natural numbers are 1 and 3, and their squares are 1 and 9, respectively. The sum of these squares is 10.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Initialize a variable to hold the sum of squares.
   - Use a loop to iterate through the first `n` odd natural numbers.
   - For each odd number, calculate its square and add it to the sum.
   - Finally, return the total sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function square_Sum(n):
       initialize sum_of_squares to 0
       for i from 0 to n-1:
           odd_number = 2 * i + 1  // This generates the first n odd numbers
           sum_of_squares += odd_number * odd_number  // Add the square of the odd number
       return sum_of_squares
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def square_Sum(n):
    # Initialize the sum of squares
    sum_of_squares = 0
    # Loop through the first n odd natural numbers
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the ith odd number
        odd_number = 2 * i + 1
        # Add the square of the odd number to the sum
        sum_of_squares += odd_number * odd_number
    # Return the total sum of squares
    return sum_of_squares
```
