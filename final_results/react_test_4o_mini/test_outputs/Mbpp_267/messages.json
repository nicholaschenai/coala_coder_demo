        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, the first two odd natural numbers are 1 and 3, and their squares are 1 and 9, respectively. The sum of these squares is 10.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - Initialize a variable to hold the sum of squares.\n   - Use a loop to iterate through the first `n` odd natural numbers.\n   - For each odd number, calculate its square and add it to the sum.\n   - Finally, return the total sum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function square_Sum(n):\n       initialize sum_of_squares to 0\n       for i from 0 to n-1:\n           odd_number = 2 * i + 1  // This generates the first n odd numbers\n           sum_of_squares += odd_number * odd_number  // Add the square of the odd number\n       return sum_of_squares\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef square_Sum(n):\n    # Initialize the sum of squares\n    sum_of_squares = 0\n    # Loop through the first n odd natural numbers\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Calculate the ith odd number\n        odd_number = 2 * i + 1\n        # Add the square of the odd number to the sum\n        sum_of_squares += odd_number * odd_number\n    # Return the total sum of squares\n    return sum_of_squares\n```"
