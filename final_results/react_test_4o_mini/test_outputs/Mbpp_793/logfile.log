INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/793 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/793 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that finds the last occurrence of a specified element in a sorted array. If the element is not found, the function should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the last position of an element in a sorted array, we can iterate through the array from the end to the beginning. This way, we can stop as soon as we find the element, ensuring that we are capturing the last occurrence. If we reach the beginning of the array without finding the element, we return -1.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function last(array, element):
       for index from length of array - 1 to 0:
           if array[index] is equal to element:
               return index
       return -1
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def last(array, element):
    # Iterate through the array from the last index to the first
    for index in range(len(array) - 1, -1, -1):
        # Check if the current element matches the target element
        if array[index] == element:
            # Return the index of the last occurrence
            return index
    # If the element is not found, return -1
    return -1
