    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: We need to create a function that checks if all the numbers located at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) in a given list are even numbers. If they are all even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we will iterate through the list and check the numbers at even indices. For each number at an even index, we will check if it is even (i.e., divisible by 2). If we find any number at an even index that is not even, we will return `False`. If we finish checking all even indices without finding any odd numbers, we will return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function even_position(numbers):\n       for index from 0 to length of numbers with step 2:\n           if numbers[index] is not even:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef even_position(numbers):\n    # Iterate through the list using a step of 2 to access even indices\n    for index in range(0, len(numbers), 2):\n        # Check if the number at the current even index is not even\n        if numbers[index] % 2 != 0:\n            return False  # Return False if an odd number is found\n    return True  # Return True if all even indexed numbers are even\n```",
