You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/790 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: We need to create a function that checks if all the numbers located at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) in a given list are even numbers. If they are all even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we will iterate through the list and check the numbers at even indices. For each number at an even index, we will check if it is even (i.e., divisible by 2). If we find any number at an even index that is not even, we will return `False`. If we finish checking all even indices without finding any odd numbers, we will return `True`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function even_position(numbers):
       for index from 0 to length of numbers with step 2:
           if numbers[index] is not even:
               return False
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def even_position(numbers):
    # Iterate through the list using a step of 2 to access even indices
    for index in range(0, len(numbers), 2):
        # Check if the number at the current even index is not even
        if numbers[index] % 2 != 0:
            return False  # Return False if an odd number is found
    return True  # Return True if all even indexed numbers are even
