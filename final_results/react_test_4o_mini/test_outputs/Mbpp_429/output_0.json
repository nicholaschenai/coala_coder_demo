    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes two tuples as input. For each corresponding pair of elements in these tuples, we will subtract the second element from the first. The result should be a new tuple containing these differences.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - We will define a function that accepts two tuples.\n   - We will iterate through the elements of both tuples simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of elements, we will compute the difference (first element minus the second element).\n   - We will collect these differences into a new tuple and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function and_tuples(tuple1, tuple2):\n       create an empty list to store results\n       for each index in the range of the length of tuple1:\n           difference = tuple1[index] - tuple2[index]\n           append difference to results list\n       convert results list to a tuple\n       return the tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef and_tuples(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Create an empty list to store the results\n    results = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the indices of the tuples\n    for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n        # Calculate the difference between the elements of the two tuples\n        difference = tuple1[i] - tuple2[i]\n        # Append the difference to the results list\n        results.append(difference)\n    \n    # Convert the results list to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(results)\n```",
