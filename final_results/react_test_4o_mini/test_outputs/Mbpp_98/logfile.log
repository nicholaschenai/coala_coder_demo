You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/98 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers (in this case, a tuple) as input. The function should multiply all the numbers together and then divide the result by the number of elements in the list. The final output should be a single number.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - Start by initializing a variable to hold the product of the numbers, starting with a value of 1 (since 1 is the multiplicative identity).
   - Loop through each number in the input list, multiplying it with the product variable.
   - After calculating the total product, divide this product by the length of the list (which is the number of elements).
   - Return the final result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function multiply_num(numbers):
       initialize product to 1
       for each number in numbers:
           product = product * number
       length_of_numbers = length of numbers
       result = product / length_of_numbers
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def multiply_num(numbers):
    # Initialize the product variable to 1
    product = 1
    
    # Loop through each number in the input tuple
    for number in numbers:
        # Multiply the current number with the product
        product *= number
    
    # Get the length of the input tuple
    length_of_numbers = len(numbers)
    
    # Divide the product by the length of the tuple
    result = product / length_of_numbers
    
    # Return the final result
    return result
