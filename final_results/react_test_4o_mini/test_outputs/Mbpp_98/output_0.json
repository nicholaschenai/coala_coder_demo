    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers (in this case, a tuple) as input. The function should multiply all the numbers together and then divide the result by the number of elements in the list. The final output should be a single number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - Start by initializing a variable to hold the product of the numbers, starting with a value of 1 (since 1 is the multiplicative identity).\n   - Loop through each number in the input list, multiplying it with the product variable.\n   - After calculating the total product, divide this product by the length of the list (which is the number of elements).\n   - Return the final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function multiply_num(numbers):\n       initialize product to 1\n       for each number in numbers:\n           product = product * number\n       length_of_numbers = length of numbers\n       result = product / length_of_numbers\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef multiply_num(numbers):\n    # Initialize the product variable to 1\n    product = 1\n    \n    # Loop through each number in the input tuple\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Multiply the current number with the product\n        product *= number\n    \n    # Get the length of the input tuple\n    length_of_numbers = len(numbers)\n    \n    # Divide the product by the length of the tuple\n    result = product / length_of_numbers\n    \n    # Return the final result\n    return result\n```",
