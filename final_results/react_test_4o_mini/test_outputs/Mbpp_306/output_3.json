The current implementation only considers a single increasing subsequence starting from each element up to `i`, which is not sufficient.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. We need to find all increasing subsequences that can be formed from the start of the list up to index `i`.\n2. For each valid subsequence, we will calculate its sum and then add the value at index `k`.\n3. We will keep track of the maximum sum encountered during this process.\n\nNow, I will implement the corrected solution based on this understanding.\n\n```python\ndef max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, n, i, k):\n    # Initialize a variable to store the maximum sum\n    max_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through all elements from 0 to i\n    for j in range(i):\n        # Start a new subsequence with arr[j]\n        current_sum = arr[j]\n        last_included = arr[j]\n        \n        # Check for increasing elements after arr[j]\n        for m in range(j + 1, i):\n            if arr[m] > last_included:\n                current_sum += arr[m]\n                last_included = arr[m]\n        \n        # Add the value at index k to the current sum\n        current_sum += arr[k]\n        \n        # Update max_sum if the current_sum is greater\n        if current_sum > max_sum:\n            max_sum = current_sum\n            \n    return max_sum\n``` \n\nThis code still does not correctly implement the logic needed to find all increasing subsequences.
