    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that calculates the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence from the start of a list up to a certain index `i`, and then includes a specific element at index `k` (where `k` is greater than `i`). The function should return this maximum sum.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - We will first find all increasing subsequences from the start of the list up to index `i`.\n   - For each of these subsequences, we will calculate their sums.\n   - We will then add the value of the element at index `k` to each of these sums.\n   - Finally, we will return the maximum sum obtained from these calculations.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, n, i, k):\n       max_sum = 0\n       for each index j from 0 to i:\n           if arr[j] is part of an increasing subsequence:\n               current_sum = sum of the increasing subsequence up to j\n               current_sum += arr[k]  // add the value at index k\n               if current_sum > max_sum:\n                   max_sum = current_sum\n       return max_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, n, i, k):\n    # Initialize a list to store the maximum sum of increasing subsequences\n    max_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through all elements from the start of the array to index i\n    for j in range(i):\n        # Initialize the current sum and the last included element\n        current_sum = arr[j]\n        last_included = arr[j]\n        \n        # Check for increasing subsequences\n        for m in range(j + 1, i):\n            if arr[m] > last_included:\n                current_sum += arr[m]\n                last_included = arr[m]\n        \n        # Add the value at index k to the current sum\n        current_sum += arr[k]\n        \n        # Update max_sum if the current_sum is greater\n        if current_sum > max_sum:\n            max_sum = current_sum\n            \n    return max_sum\n```",
