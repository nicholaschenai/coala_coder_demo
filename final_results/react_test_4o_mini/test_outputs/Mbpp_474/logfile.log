You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/474 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string and replaces all occurrences of a specified character with another character.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the input string. For each character, we will check if it matches the character we want to replace. If it does, we will add the new character to our result; if it doesn't, we will add the original character. Finally, we will join all the characters together to form the new string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function replace_char(input_string, char_to_replace, new_char):
       create an empty list to hold the result
       for each character in input_string:
           if character is equal to char_to_replace:
               append new_char to the result list
           else:
               append character to the result list
       join the result list into a string
       return the new string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def replace_char(input_string: str, char_to_replace: str, new_char: str) -> str:
    # Create an empty list to hold the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # Check if the character matches the one to replace
        if char == char_to_replace:
            # Append the new character to the result list
            result.append(new_char)
        else:
            # Append the original character to the result list
            result.append(char)
    
    # Join the result list into a string and return it
    return ''.join(result)
```
