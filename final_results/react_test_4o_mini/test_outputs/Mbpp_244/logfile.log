You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to find the next perfect square greater than a given number.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/244 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a number as input and returns the smallest perfect square that is greater than this number. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the next perfect square greater than a given number, we can:
   - Start by determining the integer square root of the given number. This will give us the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the number.
   - Increment this integer by one to find the next integer.
   - Square this incremented integer to get the next perfect square.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function next_Perfect_Square(n):
       integer_sqrt = floor(sqrt(n))  // Find the integer square root of n
       next_integer = integer_sqrt + 1  // Increment the integer square root
       next_perfect_square = next_integer * next_integer  // Square the next integer
       return next_perfect_square  // Return the next perfect square
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def next_Perfect_Square(n):
    # Find the integer square root of n
    integer_sqrt = int(n**0.5)
    # Increment the integer square root
    next_integer = integer_sqrt + 1
    # Square the next integer to get the next perfect square
    next_perfect_square = next_integer * next_integer
    # Return the next perfect square
    return next_perfect_square
```
