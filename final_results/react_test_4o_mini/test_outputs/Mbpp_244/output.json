    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a number as input and returns the smallest perfect square that is greater than this number. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the next perfect square greater than a given number, we can:\n   - Start by determining the integer square root of the given number. This will give us the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the number.\n   - Increment this integer by one to find the next integer.\n   - Square this incremented integer to get the next perfect square.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function next_Perfect_Square(n):\n       integer_sqrt = floor(sqrt(n))  // Find the integer square root of n\n       next_integer = integer_sqrt + 1  // Increment the integer square root\n       next_perfect_square = next_integer * next_integer  // Square the next integer\n       return next_perfect_square  // Return the next perfect square\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef next_Perfect_Square(n):\n    # Find the integer square root of n\n    integer_sqrt = int(n**0.5)\n    # Increment the integer square root\n    next_integer = integer_sqrt + 1\n    # Square the next integer to get the next perfect square\n    next_perfect_square = next_integer * next_integer\n    # Return the next perfect square\n    return next_perfect_square\n```",
