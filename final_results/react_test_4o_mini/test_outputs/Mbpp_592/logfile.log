You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/592 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of the products of consecutive binomial coefficients for a given integer `n`. The binomial coefficient, often represented as C(n, k), gives the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements. The function should return the total sum of the products of these coefficients for all consecutive pairs from 0 to `n`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Calculate the binomial coefficients for the given `n`.
   - For each pair of consecutive coefficients, compute their product.
   - Sum all these products together to get the final result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sum_Of_product(n):
       initialize total_sum to 0
       for k from 0 to n-1:
           calculate C(n, k) and C(n, k+1)
           product = C(n, k) * C(n, k+1)
           add product to total_sum
       return total_sum
   ```
