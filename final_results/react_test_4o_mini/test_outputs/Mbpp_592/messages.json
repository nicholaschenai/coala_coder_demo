        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of the products of consecutive binomial coefficients for a given integer `n`. The binomial coefficient, often represented as C(n, k), gives the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements. The function should return the total sum of the products of these coefficients for all consecutive pairs from 0 to `n`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Calculate the binomial coefficients for the given `n`.\n   - For each pair of consecutive coefficients, compute their product.\n   - Sum all these products together to get the final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function sum_Of_product(n):\n       initialize total_sum to 0\n       for k from 0 to n-1:\n           calculate C(n, k) and C(n, k+1)\n           product = C(n, k) * C(n, k+1)\n           add product to total_sum\n       return total_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n    # Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k)\n    if k > n or k < 0:\n        return 0\n    if k == 0 or k == n:\n        return 1\n    # Use a multiplicative approach to calculate C(n, k)\n    num = 1\n    denom = 1\n    for i in range(1, k + 1):\n        num *= (n - (i - 1))\n        denom *= i\n    return num // denom\n\ndef sum_Of_product(n):\n    # Initialize the total sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    # Loop through all k from 0 to n-1\n    for k in range(n):\n        # Calculate the product of consecutive binomial coefficients\n        product = binomial_coefficient(n, k) * binomial_coefficient(n, k + 1)\n        # Add the product to the total sum\n        total_sum += product\n    # Return the final sum\n    return total_sum\n```"
