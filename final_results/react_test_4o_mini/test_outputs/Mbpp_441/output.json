    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the surface area of a cube given the length of one of its sides. The surface area of a cube is the total area of all six of its square faces.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the surface area of a cube, we can use the formula: \n   Surface Area = 6 * (side length)^2. \n   This is because a cube has six faces, and each face is a square with an area equal to the side length squared.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION surfacearea_cube(side_length):\n       Calculate area_of_one_face = side_length * side_length\n       Calculate surface_area = 6 * area_of_one_face\n       RETURN surface_area\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the surface area of a cube\ndef surfacearea_cube(side_length):\n    # Calculate the area of one face of the cube\n    area_of_one_face = side_length * side_length\n    # Calculate the total surface area (6 faces)\n    surface_area = 6 * area_of_one_face\n    # Return the calculated surface area\n    return surface_area\n```",
