You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/441 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the surface area of a cube given the length of one of its sides. The surface area of a cube is the total area of all six of its square faces.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the surface area of a cube, we can use the formula: 
   Surface Area = 6 * (side length)^2. 
   This is because a cube has six faces, and each face is a square with an area equal to the side length squared.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION surfacearea_cube(side_length):
       Calculate area_of_one_face = side_length * side_length
       Calculate surface_area = 6 * area_of_one_face
       RETURN surface_area
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to calculate the surface area of a cube
def surfacearea_cube(side_length):
    # Calculate the area of one face of the cube
    area_of_one_face = side_length * side_length
    # Calculate the total surface area (6 faces)
    surface_area = 6 * area_of_one_face
    # Return the calculated surface area
    return surface_area
