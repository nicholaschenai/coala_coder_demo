The function should check if every element in the second tuple is smaller than the corresponding element in the first tuple. If all elements in the second tuple are smaller, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through both tuples simultaneously. For each pair of corresponding elements from the two tuples, we will compare them. If we find any element in the second tuple that is not smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple, we will return `False`. If we finish checking all pairs and find that all elements in the second tuple are smaller, we will return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function check_smaller(tuple1, tuple2):\n       for each index in range of length of tuple1:\n           if tuple2[index] is not less than tuple1[index]:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef check_smaller(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Iterate through the indices of the first tuple\n    for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n        # Check if the corresponding element in the second tuple is not smaller\n        if tuple2[i] >= tuple1[i]:\n            return False  # Return False if any element is not smaller\n    return True  # Return True if all elements in the second tuple are smaller\n```"
