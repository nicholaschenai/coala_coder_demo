You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to check if each element of second tuple is smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/809 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes two tuples as input. The function should check if every element in the second tuple is smaller than the corresponding element in the first tuple. If all elements in the second tuple are smaller, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through both tuples simultaneously. For each pair of corresponding elements from the two tuples, we will compare them. If we find any element in the second tuple that is not smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple, we will return `False`. If we finish checking all pairs and find that all elements in the second tuple are smaller, we will return `True`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function check_smaller(tuple1, tuple2):
       for each index in range of length of tuple1:
           if tuple2[index] is not less than tuple1[index]:
               return False
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def check_smaller(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Iterate through the indices of the first tuple
    for i in range(len(tuple1)):
        # Check if the corresponding element in the second tuple is not smaller
        if tuple2[i] >= tuple1[i]:
            return False  # Return False if any element is not smaller
    return True  # Return True if all elements in the second tuple are smaller
