You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/475 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a dictionary where the keys are subjects and the values are scores. The function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a subject and its corresponding score, sorted in descending order based on the scores.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Extract the items (key-value pairs) from the dictionary.
   - Sort these items based on the values (scores) in descending order.
   - Convert the sorted items into a list of tuples.
   - Return this list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sort_counter(input_dict):
       convert the dictionary items to a list of tuples
       sort the list of tuples by the second element (value) in descending order
       return the sorted list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def sort_counter(input_dict):
    # Convert the dictionary items to a list of tuples
    items = list(input_dict.items())
    
    # Sort the list of tuples by the second element (value) in descending order
    sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    
    # Return the sorted list
    return sorted_items
