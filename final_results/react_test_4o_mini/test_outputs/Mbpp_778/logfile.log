You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/778 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of elements and groups consecutive duplicate elements into sublists. For example, if the input list has consecutive identical elements, they should be collected together in a sublist.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input list while keeping track of the current element and its duplicates. Whenever we encounter a new element, we will start a new sublist. If the current element is the same as the previous one, we will add it to the current sublist. At the end of the iteration, we will return a list of all the sublists.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function pack_consecutive_duplicates(input_list):
       if input_list is empty:
           return empty list
       
       initialize an empty list called result
       initialize an empty list called current_group
       
       for each element in input_list:
           if current_group is empty or element is the same as the last element in current_group:
               add element to current_group
           else:
               add current_group to result
               start a new current_group with the current element
       
       if current_group is not empty:
           add current_group to result
       
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def pack_consecutive_duplicates(input_list):
    # Check if the input list is empty
