For example, if the input list has consecutive identical elements, they should be collected together in a sublist.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input list while keeping track of the current element and its duplicates. Whenever we encounter a new element, we will start a new sublist. If the current element is the same as the previous one, we will add it to the current sublist. At the end of the iteration, we will return a list of all the sublists.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function pack_consecutive_duplicates(input_list):\n       if input_list is empty:\n           return empty list\n       \n       initialize an empty list called result\n       initialize an empty list called current_group\n       \n       for each element in input_list:\n           if current_group is empty or element is the same as the last element in current_group:\n               add element to current_group\n           else:\n               add current_group to result\n               start a new current_group with the current element\n       \n       if current_group is not empty:\n           add current_group to result\n       \n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef pack_consecutive_duplicates(input_list):\n    # Check if the input list is empty\n    if not input_list:\n        return []\n    \n    # Initialize the result list and the current group list\n    result = []\n    current_group = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the input list\n    for element in input_list:\n        # If current_group is empty or the element is the same as the last one in current_group\n        if not current_group or element == current_group[-1]:\n            # Add the element to the current group\n            current_group.append(element)\n        else:\n            # If the element is different, add the current group to the result\n            result.append(current_group)\n            # Start a new current group with the current element\n            current_group = [element]\n    \n    # After the loop, check if there is any remaining group to add\n    if current_group:\n        result.append(current_group)\n    \n    # Return the final result\n    return result\n```"
