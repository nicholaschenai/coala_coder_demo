A substring is any sequence of characters that appears in the string, and it can be of any length from 1 to the length of the string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the number of non-empty substrings, we can use the fact that for a string of length `n`, the number of non-empty substrings can be calculated using the formula: \n   - For each character in the string, it can start a substring that can extend to the end of the string. \n   - Therefore, the first character can start `n` substrings, the second character can start `n-1` substrings, and so on, until the last character which can start 1 substring. \n   - The total number of non-empty substrings is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is given by the formula: `n * (n + 1) / 2`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function number_of_substrings(s: string) -> int:\n       n = length of s\n       return n * (n + 1) / 2\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef number_of_substrings(s: str) -> int:\n    # Calculate the length of the string\n    n = len(s)\n    # Use the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers to find the count of non-empty substrings\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2  # Use integer division to ensure the result is an integer\n```"
