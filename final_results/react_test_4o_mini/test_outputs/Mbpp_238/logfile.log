You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/238 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that counts how many non-empty substrings can be formed from a given string. A substring is any sequence of characters that appears in the string, and it can be of any length from 1 to the length of the string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the number of non-empty substrings, we can use the fact that for a string of length `n`, the number of non-empty substrings can be calculated using the formula: 
   - For each character in the string, it can start a substring that can extend to the end of the string. 
   - Therefore, the first character can start `n` substrings, the second character can start `n-1` substrings, and so on, until the last character which can start 1 substring. 
   - The total number of non-empty substrings is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is given by the formula: `n * (n + 1) / 2`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function number_of_substrings(s: string) -> int:
       n = length of s
       return n * (n + 1) / 2
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def number_of_substrings(s: str) -> int:
    # Calculate the length of the string
    n = len(s)
    # Use the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers to find the count of non-empty substrings
    return n * (n + 1) // 2  # Use integer division to ensure the result is an integer
