The series will include `n`, `n-2`, `n-4`, and so on.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - Start with the number `n`.\n   - Initialize a sum variable to zero.\n   - Use a loop to add `n` to the sum, then decrease `n` by 2.\n   - Continue this process until `n` becomes less than or equal to zero.\n   - Return the final sum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function sum_series(n):\n       initialize sum to 0\n       while n > 0:\n           add n to sum\n           decrease n by 2\n       return sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef sum_series(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum variable to store the total\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Loop until n is greater than 0\n    while n > 0:\n        # Add the current value of n to the total sum\n        total_sum += n\n        # Decrease n by 2 for the next iteration\n        n -= 2\n    \n    # Return the final calculated sum\n    return total_sum\n```"
