You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/162 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of a series of numbers starting from a given number `n` and decreasing by 2 each time, until the result is less than or equal to zero. The series will include `n`, `n-2`, `n-4`, and so on.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Start with the number `n`.
   - Initialize a sum variable to zero.
   - Use a loop to add `n` to the sum, then decrease `n` by 2.
   - Continue this process until `n` becomes less than or equal to zero.
   - Return the final sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sum_series(n):
       initialize sum to 0
       while n > 0:
           add n to sum
           decrease n by 2
       return sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def sum_series(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the sum variable to store the total
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Loop until n is greater than 0
    while n > 0:
        # Add the current value of n to the total sum
        total_sum += n
        # Decrease n by 2 for the next iteration
        n -= 2
    
    # Return the final calculated sum
    return total_sum
