    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing the elements that are present in the first list but not in the second list. The order of the elements in the output list should match their order in the first list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each element in the first list and check if it is not present in the second list. If an element from the first list is not found in the second list, we will add it to a new list. Finally, we will return this new list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function Diff(list1, list2):\n       create an empty list called result\n       for each element in list1:\n           if element is not in list2:\n               append element to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef Diff(list1, list2):\n    # Create an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the first list\n    for element in list1:\n        # Check if the element is not in the second list\n        if element not in list2:\n            # If not, append it to the result list\n            result.append(element)\n    \n    # Return the result list\n    return result\n```",
