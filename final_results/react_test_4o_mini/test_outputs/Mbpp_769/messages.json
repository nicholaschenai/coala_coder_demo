The expected output for the given test case is `[10, 20, 30, 15]`, which indicates that the order of elements in the output should be based on their original positions in the first list.\n\n2. **Identifying the Issue**: The output of my previous implementation was `[10, 15, 20, 30]`. This means that the function is returning elements from the first list that are not in the second list, but it is not maintaining the order of elements as specified in the expected output. The expected output suggests that the elements should be returned in the order they appear in the first list, but with the elements that are in the second list removed.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong**: The mistake in my previous solution was that I did not account for the order of elements that should be preserved in the output.

The expected output suggests that we should also consider the elements that are not in the second list but should be included in the final output in the order they appear in the first list. \n\nLet's implement the corrected solution. \n\n```python\ndef Diff(list1, list2):\n    # Create an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Create a set from the second list for faster lookup\n    set_list2 = set(list2)\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the first list\n    for element in list1:\n        # Check if the element is not in the second list\n        if element not in set_list2:\n            # If not, append it to the result list\n            result.append(element)\n    \n    # Return the result list\n    return result\n``` \n\nThis implementation should now correctly return the elements from the first list that are not in the second list while maintaining their original order."
