INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/593 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/593 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes an IP address as a string and removes any leading zeroes from each of the four octets (the numbers separated by dots) in the IP address.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - Split the IP address string into its four components (octets) using the dot as a delimiter.
   - For each octet, convert it to an integer to automatically remove any leading zeroes.
   - Convert the integer back to a string.
   - Join the modified octets back together with dots to form the final IP address.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function removezero_ip(ip_address):
       split ip_address by '.' into a list of octets
       for each octet in the list:
           convert octet to an integer (this removes leading zeroes)
           convert the integer back to a string
       join the list of strings back into a single string with '.' as the separator
       return the final string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def removezero_ip(ip_address: str) -> str:
    # Split the IP address into its octets
    octets = ip_address.split('.')
    
    # Remove leading zeroes from each octet
    for i in range(len(octets)):
        octets[i] = str(int(octets[i]))  # Convert to int and back to str to remove leading zeroes
    
    # Join the octets back into a single string
    return '.'.join(octets)  # Return the final IP address
