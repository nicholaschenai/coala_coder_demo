    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes an IP address as a string and removes any leading zeroes from each of the four octets (the numbers separated by dots) in the IP address.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - Split the IP address string into its four components (octets) using the dot as a delimiter.\n   - For each octet, convert it to an integer to automatically remove any leading zeroes.\n   - Convert the integer back to a string.\n   - Join the modified octets back together with dots to form the final IP address.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function removezero_ip(ip_address):\n       split ip_address by '.' into a list of octets\n       for each octet in the list:\n           convert octet to an integer (this removes leading zeroes)\n           convert the integer back to a string\n       join the list of strings back into a single string with '.' as the separator\n       return the final string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef removezero_ip(ip_address: str) -> str:\n    # Split the IP address into its octets\n    octets = ip_address.split('.')\n    \n    # Remove leading zeroes from each octet\n    for i in range(len(octets)):\n        octets[i] = str(int(octets[i]))  # Convert to int and back to str to remove leading zeroes\n    \n    # Join the octets back into a single string\n    return '.'.join(octets)  # Return the final IP address\n```",
