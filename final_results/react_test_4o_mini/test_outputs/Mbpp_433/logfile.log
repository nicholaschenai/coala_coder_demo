You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to check whether the entered number is greater than the elements of the given array.
assert check_greater([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 4) == False

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/433 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a given number is greater than all the elements in a provided list (array). The function should return `True` if the number is greater than every element in the list, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each element in the list and compare it with the given number. If we find any element that is greater than or equal to the number, we will return `False`. If we finish checking all elements and none are greater than or equal to the number, we will return `True`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function check_greater(array, number):
       for each element in array:
           if element >= number:
               return False
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def check_greater(array, number):
    # Iterate through each element in the provided array
    for element in array:
        # Check if the current element is greater than or equal to the number
        if element >= number:
            # If it is, return False
            return False
    # If no elements were greater than or equal to the number, return True
    return True
