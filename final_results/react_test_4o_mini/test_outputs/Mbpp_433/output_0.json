    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that checks if a given number is greater than all the elements in a provided list (array). The function should return `True` if the number is greater than every element in the list, and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each element in the list and compare it with the given number. If we find any element that is greater than or equal to the number, we will return `False`. If we finish checking all elements and none are greater than or equal to the number, we will return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function check_greater(array, number):\n       for each element in array:\n           if element >= number:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef check_greater(array, number):\n    # Iterate through each element in the provided array\n    for element in array:\n        # Check if the current element is greater than or equal to the number\n        if element >= number:\n            # If it is, return False\n            return False\n    # If no elements were greater than or equal to the number, return True\n    return True\n```",
