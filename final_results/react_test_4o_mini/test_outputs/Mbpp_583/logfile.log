You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/583 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the nth Catalan number. The Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that have many applications in combinatorial mathematics. The 10th Catalan number should equal 16796.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   The nth Catalan number can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   C(n) = \frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)!n!}
   \]
   This means we need to compute the factorial of numbers, specifically for \(2n\), \(n+1\), and \(n\). We can create a helper function to compute the factorial, and then use it to calculate the nth Catalan number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION factorial(n):
       IF n == 0 OR n == 1:
           RETURN 1
       ELSE:
           RETURN n * factorial(n - 1)

   FUNCTION catalan_number(n):
       C_n = factorial(2 * n) / (factorial(n + 1) * factorial(n))
       RETURN C_n
   ```

def catalan_number(n):
    # Calculate the nth Catalan number using the formula
    C_n = factorial(2 * n) // (factorial(n + 1) * factorial(n))
