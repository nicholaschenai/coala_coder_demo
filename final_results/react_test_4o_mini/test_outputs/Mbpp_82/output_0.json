    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the volume of a sphere given its radius. The volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula \\( V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius of the sphere.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Define a function named `volume_sphere` that takes one parameter, the radius of the sphere.\n   - Use the formula for the volume of a sphere to compute the volume.\n   - Return the calculated volume.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION volume_sphere(radius):\n       SET pi = 3.141592653589793\n       CALCULATE volume = (4/3) * pi * (radius ** 3)\n       RETURN volume\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef volume_sphere(radius):\n    # Define the value of pi\n    pi = 3.141592653589793\n    # Calculate the volume using the formula for the volume of a sphere\n    volume = (4/3) * pi * (radius ** 3)\n    # Return the calculated volume\n    return volume\n```",
