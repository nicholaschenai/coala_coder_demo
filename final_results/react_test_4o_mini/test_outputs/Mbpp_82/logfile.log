You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/82 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the volume of a sphere given its radius. The volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \), where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Define a function named `volume_sphere` that takes one parameter, the radius of the sphere.
   - Use the formula for the volume of a sphere to compute the volume.
   - Return the calculated volume.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION volume_sphere(radius):
       SET pi = 3.141592653589793
       CALCULATE volume = (4/3) * pi * (radius ** 3)
       RETURN volume
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def volume_sphere(radius):
    # Define the value of pi
    pi = 3.141592653589793
    # Calculate the volume using the formula for the volume of a sphere
    volume = (4/3) * pi * (radius ** 3)
    # Return the calculated volume
    return volume
```
