INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/451 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to remove all whitespaces from the given string.
assert remove_whitespaces(' Google    Flutter ') == 'GoogleFlutter'

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/451 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and removes all whitespace characters from it. The output should be a new string that contains the same characters as the input but without any spaces.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the input string. For each character, we will check if it is not a whitespace character. If it is not, we will add it to a new string. Finally, we will return the new string that contains all the non-whitespace characters.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function remove_whitespaces(input_string):
       create an empty string result
       for each character in input_string:
           if character is not a whitespace:
               append character to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def remove_whitespaces(input_string: str) -> str:
    # Create an empty string to hold the result
    result = ""
    
    # Iterate through each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # Check if the character is not a whitespace
        if char != ' ':
            # Append the non-whitespace character to the result
            result += char
            
    # Return the result string with all whitespaces removed
    return result
```
