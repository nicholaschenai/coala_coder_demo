The output should be a new string that contains the same characters as the input but without any spaces.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the input string. For each character, we will check if it is not a whitespace character. If it is not, we will add it to a new string. Finally, we will return the new string that contains all the non-whitespace characters.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function remove_whitespaces(input_string):\n       create an empty string result\n       for each character in input_string:\n           if character is not a whitespace:\n               append character to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef remove_whitespaces(input_string: str) -> str:\n    # Create an empty string to hold the result\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the input string\n    for char in input_string:\n        # Check if the character is not a whitespace\n        if char != ' ':\n            # Append the non-whitespace character to the result\n            result += char\n            \n    # Return the result string with all whitespaces removed\n    return result\n```"
