    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns a tuple. This tuple should contain the length of the longest list and the longest list itself.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate through each list in the input list of lists.\n   - For each list, we will check its length.\n   - We will keep track of the maximum length found and the corresponding list.\n   - At the end of the iteration, we will return a tuple containing the maximum length and the longest list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function max_length(lists):\n       initialize max_length to 0\n       initialize longest_list to empty list\n       \n       for each sublist in lists:\n           if length of sublist is greater than max_length:\n               update max_length to length of sublist\n               update longest_list to sublist\n       \n       return (max_length, longest_list)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef max_length(lists):\n    # Initialize the maximum length to 0\n    max_length = 0\n    # Initialize the longest list to an empty list\n    longest_list = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the input list of lists\n    for sublist in lists:\n        # Check if the current sublist's length is greater than the max_length found so far\n        if len(sublist) > max_length:\n            # Update max_length to the length of the current sublist\n            max_length = len(sublist)\n            # Update longest_list to the current sublist\n            longest_list = sublist\n    \n    # Return a tuple containing the maximum length and the longest list\n    return (max_length, longest_list)\n```",
