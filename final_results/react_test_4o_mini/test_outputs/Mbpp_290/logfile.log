INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/290 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists.
assert max_length([[0], [1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]])==(3, [13, 15, 17])

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/290 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns a tuple. This tuple should contain the length of the longest list and the longest list itself.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each list in the input list of lists.
   - For each list, we will check its length.
   - We will keep track of the maximum length found and the corresponding list.
   - At the end of the iteration, we will return a tuple containing the maximum length and the longest list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_length(lists):
       initialize max_length to 0
       initialize longest_list to empty list
       
       for each sublist in lists:
           if length of sublist is greater than max_length:
               update max_length to length of sublist
               update longest_list to sublist
       
       return (max_length, longest_list)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def max_length(lists):
