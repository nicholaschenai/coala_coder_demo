INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/624 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/624 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns the same string but in uppercase letters.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To convert a string to uppercase, we can iterate through each character in the string, check if it is a lowercase letter, and if so, convert it to its uppercase equivalent. We can build a new string with these uppercase characters and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function named `is_upper` that takes a string `s` as an argument.
   - Initialize an empty string `result` to store the uppercase characters.
   - Loop through each character `char` in the string `s`.
     - If `char` is between 'a' and 'z', convert it to uppercase by using the formula `chr(ord(char) - 32)` and append it to `result`.
     - If `char` is not a lowercase letter, append it unchanged to `result`.
   - Return the `result` string.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def is_upper(s: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty string to hold the result
    result = ""
    
    # Loop through each character in the input string
    for char in s:
        # Check if the character is a lowercase letter
        if 'a' <= char <= 'z':
            # Convert to uppercase and append to result
            result += chr(ord(char) - 32)
        else:
            # Append the character unchanged
            result += char
            
    # Return the final uppercase string
    return result
```
