We can build a new string with these uppercase characters and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function named `is_upper` that takes a string `s` as an argument.\n   - Initialize an empty string `result` to store the uppercase characters.\n   - Loop through each character `char` in the string `s`.\n     - If `char` is between 'a' and 'z', convert it to uppercase by using the formula `chr(ord(char) - 32)` and append it to `result`.\n     - If `char` is not a lowercase letter, append it unchanged to `result`.\n   - Return the `result` string.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef is_upper(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the result\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Loop through each character in the input string\n    for char in s:\n        # Check if the character is a lowercase letter\n        if 'a' <= char <= 'z':\n            # Convert to uppercase and append to result\n            result += chr(ord(char) - 32)\n        else:\n            # Append the character unchanged\n            result += char\n            \n    # Return the final uppercase string\n    return result\n```"
