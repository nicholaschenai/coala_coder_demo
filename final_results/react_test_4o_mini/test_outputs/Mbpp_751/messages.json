A min heap is a complete binary tree where each parent node is less than or equal to its child nodes.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if the array represents a min heap, we can iterate through the array and for each element, check if it satisfies the min heap property. Specifically, for each element at index `i`, we need to check if it is less than or equal to its children, which are located at indices `2*i + 1` (left child) and `2*i + 2` (right child). If any parent node is greater than its child nodes, the array does not represent a min heap.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function check_min_heap(arr):\n       for i from 0 to length of arr - 1:\n           left_child_index = 2 * i + 1\n           right_child_index = 2 * i + 2\n           \n           if left_child_index < length of arr:\n               if arr[i] > arr[left_child_index]:\n                   return False\n           \n           if right_child_index < length of arr:\n               if arr[i] > arr[right_child_index]:\n                   return False\n       \n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef check_min_heap(arr):\n    # Iterate through each element in the array\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        # Calculate the indices of the left and right children\n        left_child_index = 2 * i + 1\n        right_child_index = 2 * i + 2\n        \n        # Check if the left child exists and if the parent is greater than the left child\n        if left_child_index < len(arr):\n            if arr[i] > arr[left_child_index]:\n                return False\n        \n        # Check if the right child exists and if the parent is greater than the right child\n        if right_child_index < len(arr):\n            if arr[i] > arr[right_child_index]:\n                return False\n    \n    # If all parent-child relationships satisfy the min heap property, return True\n    return True\n```"
