The result should be a new tuple that contains all the original elements from the tuple followed by all the elements from the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can convert the tuple into a list, then extend this list with the elements from the given list. Finally, we will convert the combined list back into a tuple and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function `add_lists` that takes a list and a tuple as parameters.\n   - Convert the tuple to a list.\n   - Append the elements of the list to this new list.\n   - Convert the combined list back to a tuple.\n   - Return the new tuple.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef add_lists(lst, tup):\n    # Convert the tuple to a list\n    result_list = list(tup)\n    # Append the elements of the list to the result list\n    result_list.extend(lst)\n    # Convert the combined list back to a tuple\n    result_tuple = tuple(result_list)\n    # Return the new tuple\n    return result_tuple\n```"
