INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/106 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to append the given list to the given tuples.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/106 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of elements and a tuple of elements, and appends the elements from the list to the end of the tuple. The result should be a new tuple that contains all the original elements from the tuple followed by all the elements from the list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can convert the tuple into a list, then extend this list with the elements from the given list. Finally, we will convert the combined list back into a tuple and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function `add_lists` that takes a list and a tuple as parameters.
   - Convert the tuple to a list.
   - Append the elements of the list to this new list.
   - Convert the combined list back to a tuple.
   - Return the new tuple.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def add_lists(lst, tup):
    # Convert the tuple to a list
    result_list = list(tup)
    # Append the elements of the list to the result list
    result_list.extend(lst)
    # Convert the combined list back to a tuple
    result_tuple = tuple(result_list)
    # Return the new tuple
    return result_tuple
