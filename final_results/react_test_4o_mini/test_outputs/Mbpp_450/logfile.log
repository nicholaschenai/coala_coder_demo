You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/450 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of strings and returns a new list containing only those strings that have a specific length. The length we are interested in is 8 characters.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each string in the provided list. For each string, we will check its length. If the length of the string is equal to 8, we will add it to a new list. Finally, we will return this new list containing only the strings of the specified length.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function extract_string(string_list, length):
       create an empty list called result
       for each string in string_list:
           if the length of the string is equal to length:
               add the string to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def extract_string(string_list, length):
    # Create an empty list to store the results
    result = []
    # Iterate through each string in the provided list
    for string in string_list:
        # Check if the length of the string is equal to the specified length
        if len(string) == length:
            # If it is, add the string to the result list
            result.append(string)
    # Return the list of strings that match the specified length
    return result

# The function can be called with the example provided:
# extract_string(['Python', 'list', 'exercises', 'practice', 'solution'], 8)
```
