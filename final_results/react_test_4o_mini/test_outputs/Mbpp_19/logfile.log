You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/19 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that checks if there are any duplicate numbers in a given list of integers. If there are duplicates, the function should return `True`; if there are no duplicates, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To determine if there are duplicates in the list, we can use a set to keep track of the numbers we have seen so far. As we iterate through the list, we will check if each number is already in the set. If it is, we have found a duplicate and can return `True`. If we finish checking all numbers without finding any duplicates, we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function test_duplicate(arr):
       create an empty set called seen
       for each number in arr:
           if number is in seen:
               return True
           add number to seen
       return False
   ```

def test_duplicate(arr):
    # Create an empty set to keep track of seen numbers
    seen = set()

            return True
        # Add the number to the seen set
        seen.add(number)
    
    # If we finish the loop without finding duplicates, return False
    return False
