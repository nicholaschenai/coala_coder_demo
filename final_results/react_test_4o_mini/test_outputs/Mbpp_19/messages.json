If there are duplicates, the function should return `True`; if there are no duplicates, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To determine if there are duplicates in the list, we can use a set to keep track of the numbers we have seen so far. As we iterate through the list, we will check if each number is already in the set. If it is, we have found a duplicate and can return `True`. If we finish checking all numbers without finding any duplicates, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function test_duplicate(arr):\n       create an empty set called seen\n       for each number in arr:\n           if number is in seen:\n               return True\n           add number to seen\n       return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef test_duplicate(arr):\n    # Create an empty set to keep track of seen numbers\n    seen = set()\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the input array\n    for number in arr:\n        # Check if the number is already in the seen set\n        if number in seen:\n            # If it is, we found a duplicate, return True\n            return True\n        # Add the number to the seen set\n        seen.add(number)\n    \n    # If we finish the loop without finding duplicates, return False\n    return False\n```"
