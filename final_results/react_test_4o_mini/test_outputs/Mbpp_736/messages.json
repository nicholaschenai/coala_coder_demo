Specifically, we need to find the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the specified value.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the sorted list and compare each element with the specified value. We will keep track of the index where we find the first element that is greater than or equal to the specified value. If we reach the end of the list without finding such an element, the insertion point will be at the end of the list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function left_insertion(sorted_list, value):\n       for index from 0 to length of sorted_list:\n           if sorted_list[index] >= value:\n               return index\n       return length of sorted_list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef left_insertion(sorted_list, value):\n    # Iterate through the sorted list\n    for index in range(len(sorted_list)):\n        # Check if the current element is greater than or equal to the value\n        if sorted_list[index] >= value:\n            # Return the current index as the insertion point\n            return index\n    # If no element is found, return the length of the list as the insertion point\n    return len(sorted_list)\n```"
