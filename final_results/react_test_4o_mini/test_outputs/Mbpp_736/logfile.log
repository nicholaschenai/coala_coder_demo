You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to locate the left insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/736 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that finds the position where a given value can be inserted into a sorted list while maintaining the order of the list. Specifically, we need to find the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the specified value.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the sorted list and compare each element with the specified value. We will keep track of the index where we find the first element that is greater than or equal to the specified value. If we reach the end of the list without finding such an element, the insertion point will be at the end of the list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function left_insertion(sorted_list, value):
       for index from 0 to length of sorted_list:
           if sorted_list[index] >= value:
               return index
       return length of sorted_list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def left_insertion(sorted_list, value):
    # Iterate through the sorted list
    for index in range(len(sorted_list)):
        # Check if the current element is greater than or equal to the value
        if sorted_list[index] >= value:
            # Return the current index as the insertion point
            return index
    # If no element is found, return the length of the list as the insertion point
    return len(sorted_list)
