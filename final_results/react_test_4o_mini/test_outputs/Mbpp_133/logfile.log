You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to calculate the sum of the negative numbers of a given list of numbers.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/133 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and calculates the sum of all the negative numbers in that list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each number in the list. For each number, we will check if it is negative. If it is, we will add it to a running total. At the end of the iteration, we will return the total sum of the negative numbers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function sum_negativenum(numbers):
       initialize total_sum to 0
       for each number in numbers:
           if number is less than 0:
               add number to total_sum
       return total_sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def sum_negativenum(numbers):
    # Initialize a variable to hold the sum of negative numbers
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate through each number in the provided list
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the number is negative
        if number < 0:
            # Add the negative number to the total sum
            total_sum += number
            
    # Return the total sum of negative numbers
    return total_sum
```
