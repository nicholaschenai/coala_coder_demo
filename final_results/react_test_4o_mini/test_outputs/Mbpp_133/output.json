    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and calculates the sum of all the negative numbers in that list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each number in the list. For each number, we will check if it is negative. If it is, we will add it to a running total. At the end of the iteration, we will return the total sum of the negative numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function sum_negativenum(numbers):\n       initialize total_sum to 0\n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is less than 0:\n               add number to total_sum\n       return total_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef sum_negativenum(numbers):\n    # Initialize a variable to hold the sum of negative numbers\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the provided list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is negative\n        if number < 0:\n            # Add the negative number to the total sum\n            total_sum += number\n            \n    # Return the total sum of negative numbers\n    return total_sum\n```",
