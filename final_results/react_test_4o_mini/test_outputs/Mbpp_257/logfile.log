INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/257 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/257 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes two numbers as input and returns them in reverse order as a tuple. Specifically, the function should return the second number first, followed by the first number.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will define a function that accepts two parameters. Inside the function, we will create a tuple that contains the second parameter followed by the first parameter. Finally, we will return this tuple.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION swap_numbers(num1, num2):
       CREATE a tuple with (num2, num1)
       RETURN the tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function that takes two numbers as input
def swap_numbers(num1, num2):
    # Create a tuple with the second number first and the first number second
    result = (num2, num1)
    # Return the created tuple
    return result
```
