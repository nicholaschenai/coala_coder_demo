    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes two numbers as input and returns them in reverse order as a tuple. Specifically, the function should return the second number first, followed by the first number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will define a function that accepts two parameters. Inside the function, we will create a tuple that contains the second parameter followed by the first parameter. Finally, we will return this tuple.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION swap_numbers(num1, num2):\n       CREATE a tuple with (num2, num1)\n       RETURN the tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function that takes two numbers as input\ndef swap_numbers(num1, num2):\n    # Create a tuple with the second number first and the first number second\n    result = (num2, num1)\n    # Return the created tuple\n    return result\n```",
