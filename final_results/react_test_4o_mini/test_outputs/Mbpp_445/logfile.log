You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/445 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes two tuples, each containing pairs of numbers. The function should multiply the corresponding elements of these tuples index-wise and return a new tuple with the results.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through both tuples simultaneously.
   - For each pair of elements at the same index in the two tuples, we will multiply them together.
   - We will collect these products into a new tuple.
   - Finally, we will return this new tuple.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define a function index_multiplication(tuple1, tuple2):
       Initialize an empty list to store the results
       For each index i from 0 to the length of tuple1:
           Multiply the elements tuple1[i] and tuple2[i]
           Append the result to the results list
       Convert the results list to a tuple
       Return the results tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def index_multiplication(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results
    result = []

        # Multiply the elements at the same index
        product = (tuple1[i][0] * tuple2[i][0], tuple1[i][1] * tuple2[i][1])
        # Append the product to the results list
        result.append(product)
    
    # Convert the results list to a tuple
    return tuple(result)
