You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/140 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples (where each tuple contains numbers) and combines all the numbers from these tuples into a single set. The result should be a set of unique numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each tuple in the list. For each tuple, we will extract the numbers and add them to a set. Using a set will automatically handle duplicates, ensuring that each number appears only once in the final result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Define a function extract_singly that takes a list of tuples as input
   Initialize an empty set to store unique numbers
   For each tuple in the list:
       For each number in the tuple:
           Add the number to the set
   Return the set of unique numbers
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def extract_singly(lst):
    # Initialize an empty set to store unique numbers
    unique_numbers = set()
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the list
    for tup in lst:
        # Iterate through each number in the tuple
        for num in tup:
            # Add the number to the set
            unique_numbers.add(num)
    
    # Return the set of unique numbers
    return unique_numbers
