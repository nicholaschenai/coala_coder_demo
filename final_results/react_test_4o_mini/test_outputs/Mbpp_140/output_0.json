    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples (where each tuple contains numbers) and combines all the numbers from these tuples into a single set. The result should be a set of unique numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each tuple in the list. For each tuple, we will extract the numbers and add them to a set. Using a set will automatically handle duplicates, ensuring that each number appears only once in the final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Define a function extract_singly that takes a list of tuples as input\n   Initialize an empty set to store unique numbers\n   For each tuple in the list:\n       For each number in the tuple:\n           Add the number to the set\n   Return the set of unique numbers\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef extract_singly(lst):\n    # Initialize an empty set to store unique numbers\n    unique_numbers = set()\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the list\n    for tup in lst:\n        # Iterate through each number in the tuple\n        for num in tup:\n            # Add the number to the set\n            unique_numbers.add(num)\n    \n    # Return the set of unique numbers\n    return unique_numbers\n```",
