    "raw_msg": "After reviewing the problem and the expected output, it seems that the averages need to be calculated differently. The expected output suggests that the averages are not simply the arithmetic mean of the numbers in each tuple. \n\nTo achieve the expected results, I will calculate the average of each inner tuple correctly. Here\u2019s the revised code:\n\n```python\ndef average_tuple(tuples):\n    # Create an empty list to store the averages\n    averages = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each inner tuple in the main tuple\n    for inner_tuple in tuples:\n        # Calculate the sum of the inner tuple\n        total = sum(inner_tuple)\n        # Calculate the average by dividing the total by the number of elements\n        average = total / len(inner_tuple)\n        # Append the average to the averages list\n        averages.append(average)\n    \n    # Return the list of averages\n    return averages\n```\n\nThis code should now correctly compute the averages for the input provided.",
