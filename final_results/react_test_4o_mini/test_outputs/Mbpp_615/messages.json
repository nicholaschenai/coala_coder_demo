The expected output for the given input is `[30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]`.\n\n2. **Reviewing the Code:**\n   The code iterates through each inner tuple, calculates the sum, and divides it by the length of the inner tuple to find the average.

This suggests that the calculation of the average might not be done correctly.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Calculation:**\n   - For the first inner tuple `(10, 10, 10, 12)`, the sum is `42`, and the average should be `42 / 4 = 10.5`, which is incorrect based on the expected output.\n   - For the second inner tuple `(30, 45, 56, 45)`, the sum is `176`, and the average should be `176 / 4 = 44.0`, which is also incorrect.\n   - Continuing this way, it seems that the averages calculated do not match the expected values.\n\n5. **Finding the Mistake:**\n   The mistake is in the interpretation of the expected output. The expected averages are not simply the average of the numbers in each tuple.
