    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a tuple containing multiple tuples of numbers. The function should calculate the average of the numbers in each inner tuple and return these averages as a list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate through each inner tuple in the main tuple.\n   - For each inner tuple, we will calculate the sum of its elements and divide that sum by the number of elements to get the average.\n   - We will store each average in a list.\n   - Finally, we will return the list of averages.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function average_tuple(tuples):\n       create an empty list called averages\n       for each inner_tuple in tuples:\n           calculate the sum of inner_tuple\n           calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length of inner_tuple\n           append the average to averages\n       return averages\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef average_tuple(tuples):\n    # Create an empty list to store the averages\n    averages = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each inner tuple in the main tuple\n    for inner_tuple in tuples:\n        # Calculate the sum of the inner tuple\n        total = sum(inner_tuple)\n        # Calculate the average by dividing the total by the number of elements\n        average = total / len(inner_tuple)\n        # Append the average to the averages list\n        averages.append(average)\n    \n    # Return the list of averages\n    return averages\n```",
