INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/406 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd.
assert find_Parity(12) == False

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/406 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given integer is odd. If the number is odd, the function should return `True`, and if it is even, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if a number is odd, we can use the modulus operator `%`. If a number divided by 2 has a remainder of 1, it is odd. If it has a remainder of 0, it is even. Therefore, we will check the remainder of the number when divided by 2.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Function find_Parity(number):
       If number % 2 == 1:
           Return True
       Else:
           Return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to find the parity of a number
def find_Parity(number):
    # Check if the number is odd
    if number % 2 == 1:
        return True  # Return True if the number is odd
    else:
        return False  # Return False if the number is even
