    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of names and calculates the total length of the names that start with an uppercase letter. Any names that start with a lowercase letter should be ignored in this calculation.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate through each name in the provided list.\n   - For each name, we will check if the first character is uppercase.\n   - If it is uppercase, we will add the length of that name to a running total.\n   - Finally, we will return the total length of all the names that started with an uppercase letter.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function sample_nam(names):\n       initialize total_length to 0\n       for each name in names:\n           if the first character of name is uppercase:\n               add the length of name to total_length\n       return total_length\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef sample_nam(names):\n    # Initialize a variable to hold the total length of valid names\n    total_length = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each name in the provided list\n    for name in names:\n        # Check if the first character of the name is uppercase\n        if name and name[0].isupper():\n            # Add the length of the name to the total length\n            total_length += len(name)\n    \n    # Return the total length of names that start with an uppercase letter\n    return total_length\n```",
