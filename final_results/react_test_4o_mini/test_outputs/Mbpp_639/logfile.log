You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/639 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of names and calculates the total length of the names that start with an uppercase letter. Any names that start with a lowercase letter should be ignored in this calculation.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each name in the provided list.
   - For each name, we will check if the first character is uppercase.
   - If it is uppercase, we will add the length of that name to a running total.
   - Finally, we will return the total length of all the names that started with an uppercase letter.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sample_nam(names):
       initialize total_length to 0
       for each name in names:
           if the first character of name is uppercase:
               add the length of name to total_length
       return total_length
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def sample_nam(names):
    # Initialize a variable to hold the total length of valid names
    total_length = 0
    
    # Iterate through each name in the provided list
    for name in names:
        # Check if the first character of the name is uppercase
        if name and name[0].isupper():
            # Add the length of the name to the total length
            total_length += len(name)
    
    # Return the total length of names that start with an uppercase letter
    return total_length
```
