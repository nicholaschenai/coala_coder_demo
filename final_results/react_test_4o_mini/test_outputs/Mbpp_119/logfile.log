You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/119 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the unique element in a sorted array where every other element appears exactly twice. The unique element is the one that appears only once.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   Since the array is sorted, we can use a binary search approach to efficiently find the unique element. We can compare elements in pairs. If we find that the first element of a pair is equal to the second, we move to the next pair. If they are not equal, we check if the index is even or odd to determine which half of the array to search next. This way, we can narrow down our search space until we find the unique element.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function search(arr):
       left = 0
       right = length of arr - 1
       
       while left < right:
           mid = left + (right - left) // 2
           
           if mid is even:
               if arr[mid] == arr[mid + 1]:
                   left = mid + 2
               else:
                   right = mid
           else:
               if arr[mid] == arr[mid - 1]:
                   left = mid + 1
               else:
                   right = mid
       
       return arr[left]
   ```
