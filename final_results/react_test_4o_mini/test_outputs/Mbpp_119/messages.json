The unique element is the one that appears only once.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   Since the array is sorted, we can use a binary search approach to efficiently find the unique element. We can compare elements in pairs. If we find that the first element of a pair is equal to the second, we move to the next pair. If they are not equal, we check if the index is even or odd to determine which half of the array to search next. This way, we can narrow down our search space until we find the unique element.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function search(arr):\n       left = 0\n       right = length of arr - 1\n       \n       while left < right:\n           mid = left + (right - left) // 2\n           \n           if mid is even:\n               if arr[mid] == arr[mid + 1]:\n                   left = mid + 2\n               else:\n                   right = mid\n           else:\n               if arr[mid] == arr[mid - 1]:\n                   left = mid + 1\n               else:\n                   right = mid\n       \n       return arr[left]\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef search(arr):\n    # Initialize left and right pointers\n    left = 0\n    right = len(arr) - 1\n    \n    # Perform binary search\n    while left < right:\n        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  # Find the middle index\n        \n        # Check if mid is even\n        if mid % 2 == 0:\n            # If the element at mid is equal to the next element\n            if arr[mid] == arr[mid + 1]:\n                left = mid + 2  # Move to the right half\n            else:\n                right = mid  # Move to the left half\n        else:\n            # If mid is odd\n            if arr[mid] == arr[mid - 1]:\n                left = mid + 1  # Move to the right half\n            else:\n                right = mid  # Move to the left half\n    \n    # When left meets right, we found the unique element\n    return arr[left]\n```"
