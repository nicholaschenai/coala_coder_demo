You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/739 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that finds the index of the smallest triangular number that has a specific number of digits, `n`. A triangular number is a number that can be arranged in the shape of an equilateral triangle, and it can be calculated using the formula: T(k) = k * (k + 1) / 2, where `k` is the index of the triangular number.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to:
   - Start with an index `k` and calculate the triangular number using the formula.
   - Check if the number of digits in the triangular number is equal to `n`.
   - If it is, return the index `k`.
   - If not, increment `k` and repeat the process until we find a triangular number with `n` digits.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_Index(n):
       k = 1
       while True:
           triangular_number = k * (k + 1) / 2
           if number of digits in triangular_number == n:
               return k
           k = k + 1
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def find_Index(n):
    # Initialize the index k to 1
    k = 1
    # Loop indefinitely until we find the desired triangular number
    while True:
        # Calculate the k-th triangular number using the formula
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        # Check if the number of digits in the triangular number is equal to n
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            # If it is, return the current index k
            return k
        # Increment k to check the next triangular number
        k += 1
