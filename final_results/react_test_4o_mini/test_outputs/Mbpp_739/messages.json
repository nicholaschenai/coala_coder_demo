        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The task is to create a function that finds the index of the smallest triangular number that has a specific number of digits, `n`. A triangular number is a number that can be arranged in the shape of an equilateral triangle, and it can be calculated using the formula: T(k) = k * (k + 1) / 2, where `k` is the index of the triangular number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Start with an index `k` and calculate the triangular number using the formula.\n   - Check if the number of digits in the triangular number is equal to `n`.\n   - If it is, return the index `k`.\n   - If not, increment `k` and repeat the process until we find a triangular number with `n` digits.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function find_Index(n):\n       k = 1\n       while True:\n           triangular_number = k * (k + 1) / 2\n           if number of digits in triangular_number == n:\n               return k\n           k = k + 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef find_Index(n):\n    # Initialize the index k to 1\n    k = 1\n    # Loop indefinitely until we find the desired triangular number\n    while True:\n        # Calculate the k-th triangular number using the formula\n        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2\n        # Check if the number of digits in the triangular number is equal to n\n        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:\n            # If it is, return the current index k\n            return k\n        # Increment k to check the next triangular number\n        k += 1\n```"
