    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists (sublists) as input and returns the length of the longest sublist within that list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the longest sublist, we can iterate through each sublist in the main list, check the length of each sublist, and keep track of the maximum length found. At the end of the iteration, we will return this maximum length.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function Find_Max_Length(sublists):\n       initialize max_length to 0\n       for each sublist in sublists:\n           current_length = length of sublist\n           if current_length > max_length:\n               update max_length to current_length\n       return max_length\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef Find_Max_Length(sublists):\n    # Initialize the maximum length to 0\n    max_length = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the input list\n    for sublist in sublists:\n        # Get the length of the current sublist\n        current_length = len(sublist)\n        \n        # If the current length is greater than the max_length found so far\n        if current_length > max_length:\n            # Update max_length to the current length\n            max_length = current_length\n            \n    # Return the maximum length found\n    return max_length\n```",
