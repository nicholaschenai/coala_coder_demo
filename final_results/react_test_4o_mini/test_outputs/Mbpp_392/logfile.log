You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/392 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that calculates the maximum sum possible for a given integer `n` using a specific equation. The equation states that for any integer `n`, the maximum sum can be found by either taking the value of `n` itself or the sum of the maximum sums of `n/2`, `n/3`, `n/4`, and `n/5`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. For any integer `n`, we will check if we can get a larger sum by breaking it down into smaller parts (i.e., `n/2`, `n/3`, `n/4`, and `n/5`) and summing their maximum sums. If the sum of these parts is greater than `n`, we will return that sum; otherwise, we will return `n`. We will also use memoization to store previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function get_max_sum(n):
       if n is 0:
           return 0
       if n is in memo:
           return memo[n]
       sum_parts = get_max_sum(n/2) + get_max_sum(n/3) + get_max_sum(n/4) + get_max_sum(n/5)
       memo[n] = max(sum_parts, n)
       return memo[n]

   initialize memo as an empty dictionary
   call get_max_sum with the input value
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

# Initialize a dictionary to store previously computed results
memo = {}
