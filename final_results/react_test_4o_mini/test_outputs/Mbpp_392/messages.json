        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that calculates the maximum sum possible for a given integer `n` using a specific equation. The equation states that for any integer `n`, the maximum sum can be found by either taking the value of `n` itself or the sum of the maximum sums of `n/2`, `n/3`, `n/4`, and `n/5`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. For any integer `n`, we will check if we can get a larger sum by breaking it down into smaller parts (i.e., `n/2`, `n/3`, `n/4`, and `n/5`) and summing their maximum sums. If the sum of these parts is greater than `n`, we will return that sum; otherwise, we will return `n`. We will also use memoization to store previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function get_max_sum(n):\n       if n is 0:\n           return 0\n       if n is in memo:\n           return memo[n]\n       sum_parts = get_max_sum(n/2) + get_max_sum(n/3) + get_max_sum(n/4) + get_max_sum(n/5)\n       memo[n] = max(sum_parts, n)\n       return memo[n]\n\n   initialize memo as an empty dictionary\n   call get_max_sum with the input value\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\n# Initialize a dictionary to store previously computed results\nmemo = {}\n\ndef get_max_sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # Base case: if n is 0, the maximum sum is also 0\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    # Check if the result for n is already computed\n    if n in memo:\n        return memo[n]\n    # Recursively calculate the maximum sums for n/2, n/3, n/4, and n/5\n    sum_parts = get_max_sum(n // 2) + get_max_sum(n // 3) + get_max_sum(n // 4) + get_max_sum(n // 5)\n    # Store the maximum of the calculated sum or n itself in the memo dictionary\n    memo[n] = max(sum_parts, n)\n    # Return the computed maximum sum for n\n    return memo[n]\n```"
