You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/141 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function called `pancake_sort` that takes a list of integers and sorts them in ascending order. The function should return the sorted list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   The pancake sorting algorithm is a sorting technique that involves flipping segments of the list. The main idea is to repeatedly find the largest unsorted element, flip the list to bring it to the front, and then flip the entire unsorted segment to move it to its correct position. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function pancake_sort(arr):
       n = length of arr
       for i from n-1 down to 1:
           find the index of the maximum element in arr[0..i]
           if the maximum element is not at index i:
               flip the list to bring the maximum element to the front
               flip the list to move the maximum element to its correct position
       return arr
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def flip(arr, k):
    # This helper function reverses the order of the first k elements in arr
    start = 0
    while start < k:
        arr[start], arr[k] = arr[k], arr[start]
        start += 1
        k -= 1

def pancake_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Iterate from the end of the array to the beginning
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        # Find the index of the maximum element in arr[0..i]
