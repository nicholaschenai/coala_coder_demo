    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The task is to create a function called `pancake_sort` that takes a list of integers and sorts them in ascending order. The function should return the sorted list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   The pancake sorting algorithm is a sorting technique that involves flipping segments of the list. The main idea is to repeatedly find the largest unsorted element, flip the list to bring it to the front, and then flip the entire unsorted segment to move it to its correct position. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function pancake_sort(arr):\n       n = length of arr\n       for i from n-1 down to 1:\n           find the index of the maximum element in arr[0..i]\n           if the maximum element is not at index i:\n               flip the list to bring the maximum element to the front\n               flip the list to move the maximum element to its correct position\n       return arr\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef flip(arr, k):\n    # This helper function reverses the order of the first k elements in arr\n    start = 0\n    while start < k:\n        arr[start], arr[k] = arr[k], arr[start]\n        start += 1\n        k -= 1\n\ndef pancake_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    # Iterate from the end of the array to the beginning\n    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        # Find the index of the maximum element in arr[0..i]\n        max_index = 0\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[max_index]:\n                max_index = j\n        \n        # If the maximum element is not at index i, we need to flip\n        if max_index != i:\n            # Flip the maximum element to the front if it's not already there\n            if max_index != 0:\n                flip(arr, max_index)\n            # Now flip the maximum element to its correct position\n            flip(arr, i)\n    \n    return arr\n```",
