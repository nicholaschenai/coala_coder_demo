    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a decimal (base 10) number as input and converts it into its binary (base 2) representation. The output should be a string that represents the binary number without any leading zeros.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To convert a decimal number to binary, we can repeatedly divide the number by 2 and keep track of the remainders. The binary representation is formed by reading these remainders in reverse order. We also need to ensure that if the input is zero, we return '0' as the binary representation.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function decimal_to_binary(n):\n       if n is 0:\n           return '0'\n       initialize an empty list to store remainders\n       while n is greater than 0:\n           remainder = n % 2\n           append remainder to the list\n           n = n // 2\n       reverse the list of remainders\n       convert the list to a string and return it\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef decimal_to_binary(n: int) -> str:\n    # Check if the input number is zero\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    \n    # Initialize an empty list to store the binary digits\n    binary_digits = []\n    \n    # Loop until the number is greater than zero\n    while n > 0:\n        # Get the remainder when n is divided by 2\n        remainder = n % 2\n        # Append the remainder to the list\n        binary_digits.append(str(remainder))\n        # Update n to be the quotient of n divided by 2\n        n = n // 2\n    \n    # Reverse the list of binary digits to get the correct order\n    binary_digits.reverse()\n    \n    # Join the list into a string and return it\n    return ''.join(binary_digits)\n```",
