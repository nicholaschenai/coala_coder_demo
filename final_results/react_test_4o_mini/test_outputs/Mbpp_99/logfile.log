You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to convert the given decimal number to its binary equivalent, represented as a string with no leading zeros.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/99 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a decimal (base 10) number as input and converts it into its binary (base 2) representation. The output should be a string that represents the binary number without any leading zeros.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To convert a decimal number to binary, we can repeatedly divide the number by 2 and keep track of the remainders. The binary representation is formed by reading these remainders in reverse order. We also need to ensure that if the input is zero, we return '0' as the binary representation.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function decimal_to_binary(n):
       if n is 0:
           return '0'
       initialize an empty list to store remainders
       while n is greater than 0:
           remainder = n % 2
           append remainder to the list
           n = n // 2
       reverse the list of remainders
       convert the list to a string and return it
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(n: int) -> str:
    # Check if the input number is zero
    if n == 0:
        return '0'
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store the binary digits
    binary_digits = []
    
    # Loop until the number is greater than zero
    while n > 0:
        # Get the remainder when n is divided by 2
        remainder = n % 2
        # Append the remainder to the list
        binary_digits.append(str(remainder))
        # Update n to be the quotient of n divided by 2
        n = n // 2
    
    # Reverse the list of binary digits to get the correct order
    binary_digits.reverse()
    
    # Join the list into a string and return it
