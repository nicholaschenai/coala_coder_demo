The function should return `True` if the month has 31 days and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We can create a list of month numbers that have 31 days. Then, we can check if the input month number is in that list. If it is, we return `True`; if it is not, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function `check_monthnumb_number` that takes an integer `month`.\n   - Create a list of month numbers that have 31 days: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`.\n   - Check if the input `month` is in this list.\n   - Return `True` if it is, otherwise return `False`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef check_monthnumb_number(month: int) -> bool:\n    # List of months that have 31 days\n    months_with_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]\n    \n    # Check if the given month is in the list\n    return month in months_with_31_days\n```"
