You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/455 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given month number (from 1 to 12) has 31 days. The function should return `True` if the month has 31 days and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   We can create a list of month numbers that have 31 days. Then, we can check if the input month number is in that list. If it is, we return `True`; if it is not, we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function `check_monthnumb_number` that takes an integer `month`.
   - Create a list of month numbers that have 31 days: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`.
   - Check if the input `month` is in this list.
   - Return `True` if it is, otherwise return `False`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def check_monthnumb_number(month: int) -> bool:
    # List of months that have 31 days
    months_with_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    
    # Check if the given month is in the list
    return month in months_with_31_days
