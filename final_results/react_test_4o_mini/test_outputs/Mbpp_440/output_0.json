    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that identifies the first adverb in a given sentence and returns its position (index) along with the adverb itself. The output should be a tuple containing the starting index of the adverb, the ending index of the adverb, and the adverb string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Define a list of common adverbs to check against.\n   - Split the input sentence into words.\n   - Iterate through the words to find the first one that matches an adverb from our list.\n   - If we find an adverb, we will calculate its starting and ending positions in the original sentence and return them along with the adverb.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_adverb_position(sentence):\n       define a list of common adverbs\n       split the sentence into words\n       for each word in the list of words:\n           if the word is in the list of adverbs:\n               calculate the start index of the word in the sentence\n               calculate the end index of the word in the sentence\n               return (start index, end index, word)\n       return None (if no adverb is found)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_adverb_position(sentence: str) -> tuple:\n    # Define a list of common adverbs\n    adverbs = [\"clearly\", \"quickly\", \"silently\", \"happily\", \"sadly\", \"eagerly\", \"very\", \"too\", \"well\", \"badly\"]\n    \n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Iterate through the words to find the first adverb\n    for word in words:\n        if word in adverbs:\n            # Calculate the start index of the word in the sentence\n            start_index = sentence.index(word)\n            # Calculate the end index of the word in the sentence\n            end_index = start_index + len(word) - 1\n            # Return the indices and the adverb\n            return (start_index, end_index, word)\n    \n    # Return None if no adverb is found\n    return None\n```",
