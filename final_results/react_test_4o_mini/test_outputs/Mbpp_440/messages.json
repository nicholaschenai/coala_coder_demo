The output should be a tuple containing the starting index of the adverb, the ending index of the adverb, and the adverb string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Define a list of common adverbs to check against.\n   - Split the input sentence into words.\n   - Iterate through the words to find the first one that matches an adverb from our list.\n   - If we find an adverb, we will calculate its starting and ending positions in the original sentence and return them along with the adverb.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_adverb_position(sentence):\n       define a list of common adverbs\n       split the sentence into words\n       for each word in the list of words:\n           if the word is in the list of adverbs:\n               calculate the start index of the word in the sentence\n               calculate the end index of the word in the sentence\n               return (start index, end index, word)\n       return None (if no adverb is found)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_adverb_position(sentence: str) -> tuple:\n    # Define a list of common adverbs\n    adverbs = [\"clearly\", \"quickly\", \"silently\", \"happily\", \"sadly\", \"eagerly\", \"very\", \"too\", \"well\", \"badly\"]\n    \n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Iterate through the words to find the first adverb\n    for word in words:\n        if word in adverbs:\n            # Calculate the start index of the word in the sentence\n            start_index = sentence.index(word)\n            # Calculate the end index of the word in the sentence\n            end_index = start_index + len(word) - 1\n            # Return the indices and the adverb\n            return (start_index, end_index, word)\n    \n    # Return None if no adverb is found\n    return None\n```"

This indicates that the function did not find the adverb \"clearly\" in the input sentence.\n\n2. **Identifying the Issue**: The problem arises from the way we are checking for adverbs. The word \"clearly!!\" includes punctuation (\"!!\"), which means it does not match the plain word \"clearly\" in our list of adverbs. Therefore, the function fails to identify it as an adverb.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong**: \n   - I did not account for punctuation when checking for adverbs. The function should be able to recognize words even if they are followed by punctuation.\n   - The current implementation uses `sentence.index(word)` to find the starting index, which may not work correctly if the word contains punctuation.\n\n4. **Next Steps**: \n   - I need to modify the function to strip punctuation from the words before checking if they are in the list of adverbs.\n   - I should also ensure that the starting and ending indices are calculated correctly based on the original sentence.\n\nNow, I will revise the code to address these issues. \n\nHere\u2019s the updated solution:\n\n```python\ndef find_adverb_position(sentence: str) -> tuple:\n    # Define a list of common adverbs\n    adverbs = [\"clearly\", \"quickly\", \"silently\", \"happily\", \"sadly\", \"eagerly\", \"very\", \"too\", \"well\", \"badly\"]\n    \n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Iterate through the words to find the first adverb\n    for word in words:\n        # Strip punctuation from the word for comparison\n        stripped_word = ''.join(char for char in word if char.isalnum())\n        if stripped_word in adverbs:\n            # Calculate the start index of the word in the sentence\n            start_index = sentence.index(word)\n            # Calculate the end index of the word in the sentence\n            end_index = start_index + len(stripped_word) - 1\n            # Return the indices and the adverb\n            return (start_index, end_index, stripped_word)\n    \n    # Return None if no adverb is found\n    return None\n```"

This indicates that the end index of the adverb is calculated incorrectly.\n\n2. **Identifying the Issue**: The end index is calculated using `end_index = start_index + len(stripped_word) - 1`. In this case, `len(stripped_word)` is 7 (for \"clearly\"), and since the starting index is 0, the calculation gives `0 + 7 - 1 = 6`. This means the end index is pointing to the last character of \"clearly\" instead of the last character of the entire word including punctuation.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong**: \n   - The end index should account for the punctuation that follows the adverb. Since \"clearly!!\" has two exclamation marks, the end index should be `start_index + len(word) - 1` instead of `start_index + len(stripped_word) - 1`. This way, we include the punctuation in the end index.\n\n4. **Next Steps**: \n   - I need to adjust the calculation of the end index to use the length of the original word (including punctuation) instead of the stripped word.\n\nNow, I will revise the code to fix this issue.\n\nHere\u2019s the updated solution:\n\n```python\ndef find_adverb_position(sentence: str) -> tuple:\n    # Define a list of common adverbs\n    adverbs = [\"clearly\", \"quickly\", \"silently\", \"happily\", \"sadly\", \"eagerly\", \"very\", \"too\", \"well\", \"badly\"]\n    \n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Iterate through the words to find the first adverb\n    for word in words:\n        # Strip punctuation from the word for comparison\n        stripped_word = ''.join(char for char in word if char.isalnum())\n        if stripped_word in adverbs:\n            # Calculate the start index of the word in the sentence\n            start_index = sentence.index(word)\n            # Calculate the end index of the word in the sentence using the original word\n            end_index = start_index + len(word) - 1\n            # Return the indices and the adverb\n            return (start_index, end_index, stripped_word)\n    \n    # Return None if no adverb is found\n    return None\n```"

In this case, the word \"clearly!!\" has a length of 8 (7 characters for \"clearly\" and 1 for the exclamation mark).
