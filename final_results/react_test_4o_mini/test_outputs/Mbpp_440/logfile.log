INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/440 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that identifies the first adverb in a given sentence and returns its position (index) along with the adverb itself. The output should be a tuple containing the starting index of the adverb, the ending index of the adverb, and the adverb string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Define a list of common adverbs to check against.
   - Split the input sentence into words.
   - Iterate through the words to find the first one that matches an adverb from our list.
   - If we find an adverb, we will calculate its starting and ending positions in the original sentence and return them along with the adverb.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_adverb_position(sentence):
       define a list of common adverbs
       split the sentence into words
       for each word in the list of words:
           if the word is in the list of adverbs:
               calculate the start index of the word in the sentence
               calculate the end index of the word in the sentence
               return (start index, end index, word)
       return None (if no adverb is found)
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/440 [generation text] Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Failure**: The assertion `assert find_adverb_position("clearly!! we can see the sky")==(0, 7, 'clearly')` failed because the function returned `None` instead of the expected tuple `(0, 7, 'clearly')`. This indicates that the function did not find the adverb "clearly" in the input sentence.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: The problem arises from the way we are checking for adverbs. The word "clearly!!" includes punctuation ("!!"), which means it does not match the plain word "clearly" in our list of adverbs. Therefore, the function fails to identify it as an adverb.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**: 
   - I did not account for punctuation when checking for adverbs. The function should be able to recognize words even if they are followed by punctuation.
   - The current implementation uses `sentence.index(word)` to find the starting index, which may not work correctly if the word contains punctuation.

4. **Next Steps**: 
   - I need to modify the function to strip punctuation from the words before checking if they are in the list of adverbs.
   - I should also ensure that the starting and ending indices are calculated correctly based on the original sentence.

Now, I will revise the code to address these issues. 

Here’s the updated solution:

```python
def find_adverb_position(sentence: str) -> tuple:
    # Define a list of common adverbs
    adverbs = ["clearly", "quickly", "silently", "happily", "sadly", "eagerly", "very", "too", "well", "badly"]
    
    # Split the sentence into words
    words = sentence.split()
    
    # Iterate through the words to find the first adverb
    for word in words:
        # Strip punctuation from the word for comparison
        stripped_word = ''.join(char for char in word if char.isalnum())
        if stripped_word in adverbs:
            # Calculate the start index of the word in the sentence
            start_index = sentence.index(word)
            # Calculate the end index of the word in the sentence
            end_index = start_index + len(stripped_word) - 1
            # Return the indices and the adverb
            return (start_index, end_index, stripped_word)
    
    # Return None if no adverb is found
    return None

2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/440 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that identifies the first adverb in a given sentence and returns its position (index) along with the adverb itself. The output should be a tuple containing the starting index of the adverb, the ending index of the adverb, and the adverb string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Define a list of common adverbs to check against.
   - Split the input sentence into words.
   - Iterate through the words to find the first one that matches an adverb from our list.
   - If we find an adverb, we will calculate its starting and ending positions in the original sentence and return them along with the adverb.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_adverb_position(sentence):
       define a list of common adverbs
       split the sentence into words
       for each word in the list of words:
           if the word is in the list of adverbs:
               calculate the start index of the word in the sentence
               calculate the end index of the word in the sentence
               return (start index, end index, word)
       return None (if no adverb is found)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def find_adverb_position(sentence: str) -> tuple:
    # Define a list of common adverbs
    adverbs = ["clearly", "quickly", "silently", "happily", "sadly", "eagerly", "very", "too", "well", "badly"]
    
    # Split the sentence into words
    words = sentence.split()
    
    # Iterate through the words to find the first adverb
    for word in words:
        if word in adverbs:
            # Calculate the start index of the word in the sentence
            start_index = sentence.index(word)
            # Calculate the end index of the word in the sentence

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/440 [prompt] Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Failure**: The assertion `assert find_adverb_position("clearly!! we can see the sky")==(0, 7, 'clearly')` failed because the function returned `None` instead of the expected tuple `(0, 7, 'clearly')`. This indicates that the function did not find the adverb "clearly" in the input sentence.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: The problem arises from the way we are checking for adverbs. The word "clearly!!" includes punctuation ("!!"), which means it does not match the plain word "clearly" in our list of adverbs. Therefore, the function fails to identify it as an adverb.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**: 
   - I did not account for punctuation when checking for adverbs. The function should be able to recognize words even if they are followed by punctuation.
   - The current implementation uses `sentence.index(word)` to find the starting index, which may not work correctly if the word contains punctuation.

4. **Next Steps**: 
   - I need to modify the function to strip punctuation from the words before checking if they are in the list of adverbs.
   - I should also ensure that the starting and ending indices are calculated correctly based on the original sentence.

Now, I will revise the code to address these issues. 

Here’s the updated solution:

```python
def find_adverb_position(sentence: str) -> tuple:
    # Define a list of common adverbs
    adverbs = ["clearly", "quickly", "silently", "happily", "sadly", "eagerly", "very", "too", "well", "badly"]
    
    # Split the sentence into words
    words = sentence.split()
    
    # Iterate through the words to find the first adverb
    for word in words:
        # Strip punctuation from the word for comparison
        stripped_word = ''.join(char for char in word if char.isalnum())
        if stripped_word in adverbs:
            # Calculate the start index of the word in the sentence
            start_index = sentence.index(word)
            # Calculate the end index of the word in the sentence
            end_index = start_index + len(stripped_word) - 1
            # Return the indices and the adverb
            return (start_index, end_index, stripped_word)
    
    # Return None if no adverb is found
    return None

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/440 [generation text] Let's analyze the situation step-by-step again:

1. **Understanding the Failure**: The assertion `assert find_adverb_position("clearly!! we can see the sky")==(0, 7, 'clearly')` failed because the function returned `(0, 6, 'clearly')` instead of the expected `(0, 7, 'clearly')`. This indicates that the end index of the adverb is calculated incorrectly.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: The end index is calculated using `end_index = start_index + len(stripped_word) - 1`. In this case, `len(stripped_word)` is 7 (for "clearly"), and since the starting index is 0, the calculation gives `0 + 7 - 1 = 6`. This means the end index is pointing to the last character of "clearly" instead of the last character of the entire word including punctuation.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**: 
   - The end index should account for the punctuation that follows the adverb. Since "clearly!!" has two exclamation marks, the end index should be `start_index + len(word) - 1` instead of `start_index + len(stripped_word) - 1`. This way, we include the punctuation in the end index.

4. **Next Steps**: 
   - I need to adjust the calculation of the end index to use the length of the original word (including punctuation) instead of the stripped word.

Now, I will revise the code to fix this issue.

Here’s the updated solution:

def find_adverb_position(sentence: str) -> tuple:

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/440 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that identifies the first adverb in a given sentence and returns its position (index) along with the adverb itself. The output should be a tuple containing the starting index of the adverb, the ending index of the adverb, and the adverb string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Define a list of common adverbs to check against.
   - Split the input sentence into words.
   - Iterate through the words to find the first one that matches an adverb from our list.
   - If we find an adverb, we will calculate its starting and ending positions in the original sentence and return them along with the adverb.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_adverb_position(sentence):
       define a list of common adverbs
       split the sentence into words
       for each word in the list of words:
           if the word is in the list of adverbs:
               calculate the start index of the word in the sentence
               calculate the end index of the word in the sentence
               return (start index, end index, word)
       return None (if no adverb is found)
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/440 [prompt] Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Failure**: The assertion `assert find_adverb_position("clearly!! we can see the sky")==(0, 7, 'clearly')` failed because the function returned `None` instead of the expected tuple `(0, 7, 'clearly')`. This indicates that the function did not find the adverb "clearly" in the input sentence.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: The problem arises from the way we are checking for adverbs. The word "clearly!!" includes punctuation ("!!"), which means it does not match the plain word "clearly" in our list of adverbs. Therefore, the function fails to identify it as an adverb.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**: 
   - I did not account for punctuation when checking for adverbs. The function should be able to recognize words even if they are followed by punctuation.
   - The current implementation uses `sentence.index(word)` to find the starting index, which may not work correctly if the word contains punctuation.

4. **Next Steps**: 
   - I need to modify the function to strip punctuation from the words before checking if they are in the list of adverbs.
   - I should also ensure that the starting and ending indices are calculated correctly based on the original sentence.

Now, I will revise the code to address these issues. 

Here’s the updated solution:

```python
def find_adverb_position(sentence: str) -> tuple:
    # Define a list of common adverbs
    adverbs = ["clearly", "quickly", "silently", "happily", "sadly", "eagerly", "very", "too", "well", "badly"]
    
    # Split the sentence into words
    words = sentence.split()
    
    # Iterate through the words to find the first adverb
    for word in words:
        # Strip punctuation from the word for comparison
        stripped_word = ''.join(char for char in word if char.isalnum())
        if stripped_word in adverbs:
            # Calculate the start index of the word in the sentence
            start_index = sentence.index(word)
            # Calculate the end index of the word in the sentence
            end_index = start_index + len(stripped_word) - 1
            # Return the indices and the adverb
            return (start_index, end_index, stripped_word)
    
    # Return None if no adverb is found

1. **Understanding the Failure**: The assertion `assert find_adverb_position("clearly!! we can see the sky")==(0, 7, 'clearly')` failed because the function returned `(0, 6, 'clearly')` instead of the expected `(0, 7, 'clearly')`. This indicates that the end index of the adverb is calculated incorrectly.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: The end index is calculated using `end_index = start_index + len(stripped_word) - 1`. In this case, `len(stripped_word)` is 7 (for "clearly"), and since the starting index is 0, the calculation gives `0 + 7 - 1 = 6`. This means the end index is pointing to the last character of "clearly" instead of the last character of the entire word including punctuation.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**: 
   - The end index should account for the punctuation that follows the adverb. Since "clearly!!" has two exclamation marks, the end index should be `start_index + len(word) - 1` instead of `start_index + len(stripped_word) - 1`. This way, we include the punctuation in the end index.

4. **Next Steps**: 
   - I need to adjust the calculation of the end index to use the length of the original word (including punctuation) instead of the stripped word.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/440 [generation text] Let's analyze the situation step-by-step again:

1. **Understanding the Failure**: The assertion `assert find_adverb_position("clearly!! we can see the sky")==(0, 7, 'clearly')` failed because the function returned `(0, 8, 'clearly')` instead of the expected `(0, 7, 'clearly')`. This indicates that the end index is still being calculated incorrectly.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: The end index is calculated using `end_index = start_index + len(word) - 1`. In this case, the word "clearly!!" has a length of 8 (7 characters for "clearly" and 1 for the exclamation mark). Therefore, the calculation gives `0 + 8 - 1 = 8`, which points to the last character of the word instead of the last character of the adverb itself.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**: 
   - The expected end index should be the index of the last character of the adverb "clearly", which is at index 7. However, since I am using the length of the entire word (including punctuation) to calculate the end index, it results in an off-by-one error.

4. **Next Steps**: 
   - I need to adjust the calculation of the end index to ensure it points to the last character of the adverb itself, which is `start_index + len(stripped_word) - 1`. This will ensure that the end index correctly reflects the position of the last character of the adverb without including punctuation.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/440 [prompt] Let's analyze the situation step-by-step again:

1. **Understanding the Failure**: The assertion `assert find_adverb_position("clearly!! we can see the sky")==(0, 7, 'clearly')` failed because the function returned `(0, 6, 'clearly')` instead of the expected `(0, 7, 'clearly')`. This indicates that the end index of the adverb is calculated incorrectly.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: The end index is calculated using `end_index = start_index + len(stripped_word) - 1`. In this case, `len(stripped_word)` is 7 (for "clearly"), and since the starting index is 0, the calculation gives `0 + 7 - 1 = 6`. This means the end index is pointing to the last character of "clearly" instead of the last character of the entire word including punctuation.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**: 
   - The end index should account for the punctuation that follows the adverb. Since "clearly!!" has two exclamation marks, the end index should be `start_index + len(word) - 1` instead of `start_index + len(stripped_word) - 1`. This way, we include the punctuation in the end index.

4. **Next Steps**: 
   - I need to adjust the calculation of the end index to use the length of the original word (including punctuation) instead of the stripped word.

Now, I will revise the code to fix this issue.

Here’s the updated solution:

```python
def find_adverb_position(sentence: str) -> tuple:
    # Define a list of common adverbs
    adverbs = ["clearly", "quickly", "silently", "happily", "sadly", "eagerly", "very", "too", "well", "badly"]
    
    # Split the sentence into words
    words = sentence.split()
    
    # Iterate through the words to find the first adverb
    for word in words:
        # Strip punctuation from the word for comparison
        stripped_word = ''.join(char for char in word if char.isalnum())
        if stripped_word in adverbs:
            # Calculate the start index of the word in the sentence
            start_index = sentence.index(word)
            # Calculate the end index of the word in the sentence using the original word
            end_index = start_index + len(word) - 1
            # Return the indices and the adverb
            return (start_index, end_index, stripped_word)
    
    # Return None if no adverb is found
    return None
```

1. **Understanding the Failure**: The assertion `assert find_adverb_position("clearly!! we can see the sky")==(0, 7, 'clearly')` failed because the function returned `(0, 8, 'clearly')` instead of the expected `(0, 7, 'clearly')`. This indicates that the end index is still being calculated incorrectly.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: The end index is calculated using `end_index = start_index + len(word) - 1`. In this case, the word "clearly!!" has a length of 8 (7 characters for "clearly" and 1 for the exclamation mark). Therefore, the calculation gives `0 + 8 - 1 = 8`, which points to the last character of the word instead of the last character of the adverb itself.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**: 
   - The expected end index should be the index of the last character of the adverb "clearly", which is at index 7. However, since I am using the length of the entire word (including punctuation) to calculate the end index, it results in an off-by-one error.

4. **Next Steps**: 
   - I need to adjust the calculation of the end index to ensure it points to the last character of the adverb itself, which is `start_index + len(stripped_word) - 1`. This will ensure that the end index correctly reflects the position of the last character of the adverb without including punctuation.
