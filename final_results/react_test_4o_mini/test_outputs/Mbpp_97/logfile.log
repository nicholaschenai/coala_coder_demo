You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find frequency of each element in a flattened list of lists, returned in a dictionary.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/97 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists (a 2D list) and counts how many times each unique element appears across all the lists. The result should be returned as a dictionary where the keys are the unique elements and the values are their respective counts.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Start with an empty dictionary to hold the frequency counts.
   - Loop through each sublist in the main list.
   - For each element in the sublist, check if it is already a key in the dictionary.
   - If it is, increment its count; if not, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.
   - Finally, return the dictionary containing the frequency of each element.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function frequency_lists(input_list):
       create an empty dictionary called frequency
       for each sublist in input_list:
           for each element in sublist:
               if element is in frequency:
                   increment frequency[element] by 1
               else:
                   set frequency[element] to 1
       return frequency
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def frequency_lists(input_list):
    # Create an empty dictionary to hold the frequency counts
    frequency = {}
