    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists (a 2D list) and counts how many times each unique element appears across all the lists. The result should be returned as a dictionary where the keys are the unique elements and the values are their respective counts.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - Start with an empty dictionary to hold the frequency counts.\n   - Loop through each sublist in the main list.\n   - For each element in the sublist, check if it is already a key in the dictionary.\n   - If it is, increment its count; if not, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n   - Finally, return the dictionary containing the frequency of each element.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function frequency_lists(input_list):\n       create an empty dictionary called frequency\n       for each sublist in input_list:\n           for each element in sublist:\n               if element is in frequency:\n                   increment frequency[element] by 1\n               else:\n                   set frequency[element] to 1\n       return frequency\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef frequency_lists(input_list):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to hold the frequency counts\n    frequency = {}\n    \n    # Loop through each sublist in the input list\n    for sublist in input_list:\n        # Loop through each element in the sublist\n        for element in sublist:\n            # If the element is already in the frequency dictionary\n            if element in frequency:\n                # Increment its count\n                frequency[element] += 1\n            else:\n                # Otherwise, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1\n                frequency[element] = 1\n    \n    # Return the dictionary containing the frequency of each element\n    return frequency\n```",
