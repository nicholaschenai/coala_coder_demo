If there are no numerical values, the function should not return anything.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We will iterate through each element in the list. For each element, we will check if it is a number (either an integer or a float). If it is, we will compare it with the current maximum value found so far. If it is greater than the current maximum, we will update the maximum.
