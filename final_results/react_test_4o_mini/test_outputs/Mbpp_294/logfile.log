INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/294 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find the maximum value in a given heterogeneous list.
assert max_val(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version'])==5

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/294 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list containing different types of elements (like strings and numbers) and returns the maximum numerical value from that list. If there are no numerical values, the function should not return anything.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   We will iterate through each element in the list. For each element, we will check if it is a number (either an integer or a float). If it is, we will compare it with the current maximum value found so far. If it is greater than the current maximum, we will update the maximum. At the end of the iteration, we will return the maximum value found.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function max_val(input_list):
       initialize max_value to None
       for each element in input_list:
           if element is a number:
               if max_value is None or element > max_value:
                   set max_value to element
       return max_value
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def max_val(input_list):
    # Initialize max_value to None to track the maximum number found
    max_value = None
    
    # Iterate through each element in the input list
    for element in input_list:
        # Check if the element is a number (int or float)
        if isinstance(element, (int, float)):
            # If max_value is None or the current element is greater than max_value
            if max_value is None or element > max_value:
                # Update max_value to the current element
                max_value = element
    
    # Return the maximum value found
    return max_value
