    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that counts how many pairs of strings in a given list are reverse of each other. For example, if one string is \"abc\", we should check if \"cba\" is also in the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - We will iterate through each string in the list.\n   - For each string, we will check if its reverse exists in the list.\n   - We need to ensure that we do not count the same pair twice, so we can keep track of the strings we have already counted.\n   - We will maintain a count of the pairs found.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_reverse_pairs(string_list):\n       initialize a set to keep track of counted strings\n       initialize a counter to zero\n       for each string in string_list:\n           if the string is not in counted strings:\n               reverse the string\n               if the reversed string is in string_list:\n                   increment the counter\n                   add both the string and its reverse to counted strings\n       return the counter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_reverse_pairs(string_list):\n    # Initialize a set to keep track of counted strings\n    counted = set()\n    # Initialize a counter to zero\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each string in the list\n    for string in string_list:\n        # Check if the string has already been counted\n        if string not in counted:\n            # Reverse the string\n            reversed_string = string[::-1]\n            # Check if the reversed string is in the list\n            if reversed_string in string_list:\n                # Increment the counter\n                count += 1\n                # Add both the string and its reverse to counted\n                counted.add(string)\n                counted.add(reversed_string)\n    \n    # Return the count of reverse pairs found\n    return count\n```",
