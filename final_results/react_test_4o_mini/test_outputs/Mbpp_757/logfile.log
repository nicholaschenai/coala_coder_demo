You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/757 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that counts how many pairs of strings in a given list are reverse of each other. For example, if one string is "abc", we should check if "cba" is also in the list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - We will iterate through each string in the list.
   - For each string, we will check if its reverse exists in the list.
   - We need to ensure that we do not count the same pair twice, so we can keep track of the strings we have already counted.
   - We will maintain a count of the pairs found.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function count_reverse_pairs(string_list):
       initialize a set to keep track of counted strings
       initialize a counter to zero
       for each string in string_list:
           if the string is not in counted strings:
               reverse the string
               if the reversed string is in string_list:
                   increment the counter
                   add both the string and its reverse to counted strings
       return the counter
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def count_reverse_pairs(string_list):
    # Initialize a set to keep track of counted strings
    counted = set()
    # Initialize a counter to zero
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each string in the list
    for string in string_list:
        # Check if the string has already been counted
        if string not in counted:
            # Reverse the string
            reversed_string = string[::-1]
            # Check if the reversed string is in the list
            if reversed_string in string_list:
                # Increment the counter
                count += 1
                # Add both the string and its reverse to counted
                counted.add(string)
                counted.add(reversed_string)
