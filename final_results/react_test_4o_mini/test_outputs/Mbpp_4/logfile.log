You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/4 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and an integer `n`, and returns the `n` largest integers from that list in descending order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Sort the list of integers in descending order.
   - Select the first `n` elements from the sorted list, as these will be the largest integers.
   - Return this selection as the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function heap_queue_largest(numbers, n):
       sort numbers in descending order
       select the first n elements from the sorted list
       return the selected elements
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def heap_queue_largest(numbers, n):
    # Step 1: Sort the list of numbers in descending order
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers, reverse=True)
    
    # Step 2: Select the first n elements from the sorted list
    largest_numbers = sorted_numbers[:n]
    
    # Step 3: Return the selected elements
    return largest_numbers
```
