    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns the first character that appears only once in that string. If all characters are repeated, the function should return `None`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each character in the string. After counting, we can iterate through the string again to find the first character that has a count of one. If we find such a character, we return it; if not, we return `None`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function first_non_repeating_character(s):\n       create an empty dictionary to count characters\n       for each character in the string s:\n           if character is in the dictionary:\n               increment its count\n           else:\n               set its count to 1\n       \n       for each character in the string s:\n           if the count of the character in the dictionary is 1:\n               return the character\n       \n       return None\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef first_non_repeating_character(s: str) -> str:\n    # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each character\n    char_count = {}\n    \n    # Count each character in the string\n    for char in s:\n        if char in char_count:\n            char_count[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_count[char] = 1\n    \n    # Find the first character that has a count of 1\n    for char in s:\n        if char_count[char] == 1:\n            return char\n    \n    # If no non-repeating character is found, return None\n    return None\n```",
