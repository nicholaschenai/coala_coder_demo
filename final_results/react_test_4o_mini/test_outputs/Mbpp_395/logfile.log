You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/395 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns the first character that appears only once in that string. If all characters are repeated, the function should return `None`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each character in the string. After counting, we can iterate through the string again to find the first character that has a count of one. If we find such a character, we return it; if not, we return `None`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function first_non_repeating_character(s):
       create an empty dictionary to count characters
       for each character in the string s:
           if character is in the dictionary:
               increment its count
           else:
               set its count to 1
       
       for each character in the string s:
           if the count of the character in the dictionary is 1:
               return the character
       
       return None
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def first_non_repeating_character(s: str) -> str:
    # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each character
    char_count = {}
    
    # Count each character in the string
    for char in s:
        if char in char_count:
            char_count[char] += 1
        else:
            char_count[char] = 1
    
    # Find the first character that has a count of 1
    for char in s:
        if char_count[char] == 1:
            return char
    
    # If no non-repeating character is found, return None
