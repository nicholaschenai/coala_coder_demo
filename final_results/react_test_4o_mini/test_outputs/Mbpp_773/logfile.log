You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/773 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that searches for a specific substring within a given string. If the substring is found, the function should return the substring along with the starting and ending positions of its first occurrence. If the substring is not found, the function should return None.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use the built-in string method `find()` which returns the lowest index of the substring if it is found in the string. If the substring is not found, it returns -1. We will check the result of `find()`, and if it is not -1, we will calculate the ending position of the substring by adding its length to the starting position. Finally, we will return the substring along with its starting and ending positions. If the substring is not found, we will return None.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function occurance_substring(main_string, substring):
       start_index = main_string.find(substring)
       if start_index is -1:
           return None
       end_index = start_index + length of substring
       return (substring, start_index, end_index)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def occurance_substring(main_string: str, substring: str):
    # Find the starting index of the substring in the main string
    start_index = main_string.find(substring)
    
    # If the substring is not found, return None
    if start_index == -1:
        return None
    
    # Calculate the ending index of the substring
    end_index = start_index + len(substring)
    
    # Return the substring along with its starting and ending positions
    return (substring, start_index, end_index)
```
