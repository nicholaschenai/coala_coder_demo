If the substring is found, the function should return the substring along with the starting and ending positions of its first occurrence. If the substring is not found, the function should return None.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can use the built-in string method `find()` which returns the lowest index of the substring if it is found in the string. If the substring is not found, it returns -1. We will check the result of `find()`, and if it is not -1, we will calculate the ending position of the substring by adding its length to the starting position. Finally, we will return the substring along with its starting and ending positions. If the substring is not found, we will return None.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function occurance_substring(main_string, substring):\n       start_index = main_string.find(substring)\n       if start_index is -1:\n           return None\n       end_index = start_index + length of substring\n       return (substring, start_index, end_index)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef occurance_substring(main_string: str, substring: str):\n    # Find the starting index of the substring in the main string\n    start_index = main_string.find(substring)\n    \n    # If the substring is not found, return None\n    if start_index == -1:\n        return None\n    \n    # Calculate the ending index of the substring\n    end_index = start_index + len(substring)\n    \n    # Return the substring along with its starting and ending positions\n    return (substring, start_index, end_index)\n```"
