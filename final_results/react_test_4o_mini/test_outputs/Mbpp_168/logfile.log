INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/168 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/168 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that counts how many times a specific number appears in a given list of numbers. If the number is not present in the list, the function should return 0.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list and keep a count of how many times we encounter the specified number. We will initialize a counter to zero and increment it each time we find a match. Finally, we will return the counter.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function frequency(numbers, target):
       initialize count to 0
       for each number in numbers:
           if number is equal to target:
               increment count
       return count
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def frequency(numbers, target):
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of occurrences
    count = 0
    # Iterate through each number in the provided list
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the current number is equal to the target number
        if number == target:
            # Increment the count if a match is found
            count += 1
    # Return the total count of occurrences
    return count
```
