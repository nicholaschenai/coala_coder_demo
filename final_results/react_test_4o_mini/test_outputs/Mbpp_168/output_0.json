    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that counts how many times a specific number appears in a given list of numbers. If the number is not present in the list, the function should return 0.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list and keep a count of how many times we encounter the specified number. We will initialize a counter to zero and increment it each time we find a match. Finally, we will return the counter.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function frequency(numbers, target):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is equal to target:\n               increment count\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef frequency(numbers, target):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of occurrences\n    count = 0\n    # Iterate through each number in the provided list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the current number is equal to the target number\n        if number == target:\n            # Increment the count if a match is found\n            count += 1\n    # Return the total count of occurrences\n    return count\n```",
