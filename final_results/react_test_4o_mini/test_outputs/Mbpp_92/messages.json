        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that checks if a given number is \"undulating.\" An undulating number is defined as one where the digits alternate between two different values. For example, the number 1212121 is undulating because it alternates between 1 and 2.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if a number is undulating, we can convert the number to a string to easily access each digit. We will then check if the digits alternate between two distinct values. If we find that the digits do not alternate correctly, we will return False. If they do alternate correctly throughout the entire number, we will return True.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Convert the number to a string.\n   - Check if the length of the string is less than 2; if so, return True (since a single digit or empty number is trivially undulating).\n   - Initialize two variables to hold the first and second distinct digits.\n   - Loop through the digits of the string:\n     - If the current index is even, check if it matches the first digit.\n     - If the current index is odd, check if it matches the second digit.\n     - If a mismatch is found, return False.\n   - If the loop completes without mismatches, return True.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef is_undulating(number: int) -> bool:\n    # Convert the number to a string to access each digit\n    num_str = str(number)\n    \n    # If the number has less than 2 digits, it is undulating\n    if len(num_str) < 2:\n        return True\n    \n    # Initialize the first and second distinct digits\n    first_digit = num_str[0]\n    second_digit = None\n    \n    # Find the second distinct digit\n    for digit in num_str:\n        if digit != first_digit:\n            second_digit = digit\n            break\n    \n    # If there is no second distinct digit, return False\n    if second_digit is None:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check the undulating pattern\n    for i in range(len(num_str)):\n        if i % 2 == 0:  # Even index\n            if num_str[i] != first_digit:\n                return False\n        else:  # Odd index\n            if num_str[i] != second_digit:\n                return False\n    \n    # If all checks passed, return True\n    return True\n```"
