        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The task is to create a function that finds the nth polite number. A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. The first few polite numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, etc. The only numbers that are not polite are the powers of two (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To find the nth polite number, we can iterate through positive integers, checking if each number is polite. We can do this by checking if the number is a power of two. If it is not a power of two, we count it as a polite number. We continue this process until we reach the nth polite number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function is_polite(n):\n       count = 0\n       current_number = 1\n       while count < n:\n           if current_number is not a power of two:\n               count += 1\n           current_number += 1\n       return current_number - 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef is_power_of_two(x):\n    # A helper function to check if x is a power of two\n    return (x & (x - 1)) == 0\n\ndef is_polite(n):\n    # Initialize count of polite numbers found\n    count = 0\n    # Start checking from the first positive integer\n    current_number = 1\n    \n    # Loop until we find the nth polite number\n    while count < n:\n        # Check if the current number is not a power of two\n        if not is_power_of_two(current_number):\n            count += 1  # Increment the count of polite numbers\n        current_number += 1  # Move to the next number\n    \n    # Return the last found polite number\n    return current_number - 1\n```"
