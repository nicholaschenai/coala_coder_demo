You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/765 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that finds the nth polite number. A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. The first few polite numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, etc. The only numbers that are not polite are the powers of two (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the nth polite number, we can iterate through positive integers, checking if each number is polite. We can do this by checking if the number is a power of two. If it is not a power of two, we count it as a polite number. We continue this process until we reach the nth polite number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function is_polite(n):
       count = 0
       current_number = 1
       while count < n:
           if current_number is not a power of two:
               count += 1
           current_number += 1
       return current_number - 1
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def is_power_of_two(x):
    # A helper function to check if x is a power of two
    return (x & (x - 1)) == 0

def is_polite(n):
    # Initialize count of polite numbers found
    count = 0
    # Start checking from the first positive integer
    current_number = 1
    
    # Loop until we find the nth polite number
    while count < n:
        # Check if the current number is not a power of two
        if not is_power_of_two(current_number):
            count += 1  # Increment the count of polite numbers
        current_number += 1  # Move to the next number
    
    # Return the last found polite number
    return current_number - 1
