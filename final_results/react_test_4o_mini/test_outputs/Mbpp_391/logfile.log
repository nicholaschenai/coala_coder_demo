You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/391 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes three lists as input: one containing student IDs, another containing student names, and the last containing their corresponding scores. The function should return a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a student with their ID as the key, and another dictionary as the value that contains the student's name and score.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through the indices of the input lists.
   - For each index, we will create a dictionary where the key is the student ID, and the value is another dictionary containing the student's name and score.
   - We will collect all these dictionaries into a list and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function convert_list_dictionary(ids, names, scores):
       create an empty list called result
       for each index in the range of the length of ids:
           create a dictionary with ids[index] as the key
           create a nested dictionary with names[index] as the key and scores[index] as the value
           add this dictionary to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def convert_list_dictionary(ids, names, scores):
    # Create an empty list to hold the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through the indices of the input lists
    for i in range(len(ids)):
        # Create a dictionary for each student
        student_dict = {ids[i]: {names[i]: scores[i]}}
        # Add the student dictionary to the result list
        result.append(student_dict)
    
    # Return the final list of dictionaries
    return result
