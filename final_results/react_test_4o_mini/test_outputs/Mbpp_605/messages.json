A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To check if a number is prime, we can follow these steps:\n   - If the number is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime.\n   - If the number is 2, it is prime (the only even prime number).\n   - For numbers greater than 2, we can check for factors from 2 up to the square root of the number. If we find any factors in this range, the number is not prime; otherwise, it is prime.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function prime_num(n):\n       if n <= 1:\n           return False\n       if n == 2:\n           return True\n       if n is even:\n           return False\n       for i from 3 to sqrt(n) step 2:\n           if n is divisible by i:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef is_even(n):\n    return n % 2 == 0\n\ndef is_divisible(n, i):\n    return n % i == 0\n\ndef prime_num(n):\n    # Check if the number is less than or equal to 1\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    # Check if the number is 2\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    # Check if the number is even\n    if is_even(n):\n        return False\n    # Check for factors from 3 to the square root of n\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        if is_divisible(n, i):\n            return False\n    # If no factors were found, the number is prime\n    return True\n```"
