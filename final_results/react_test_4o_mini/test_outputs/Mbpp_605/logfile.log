INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/605 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/605 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that determines whether a given integer is a prime number. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To check if a number is prime, we can follow these steps:
   - If the number is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime.
   - If the number is 2, it is prime (the only even prime number).
   - For numbers greater than 2, we can check for factors from 2 up to the square root of the number. If we find any factors in this range, the number is not prime; otherwise, it is prime.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function prime_num(n):
       if n <= 1:
           return False
       if n == 2:
           return True
       if n is even:
           return False
       for i from 3 to sqrt(n) step 2:
           if n is divisible by i:
               return False
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def is_even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0

def is_divisible(n, i):
    return n % i == 0

    # Check for factors from 3 to the square root of n
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if is_divisible(n, i):
            return False
    # If no factors were found, the number is prime
