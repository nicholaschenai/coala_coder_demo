INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/293 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the length of the third side of a right-angled triangle when the lengths of the other two sides are provided. The function should return the length of the third side.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   In a right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. If we know the lengths of the two sides, we can calculate the hypotenuse using the formula: 
   \[
   c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
   \]
   where \(c\) is the hypotenuse, and \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the other two sides. If one of the sides is the hypotenuse, we can find the other side using:
   \[
   a = \sqrt{c^2 - b^2}
   \]
   or 
   \[
   b = \sqrt{c^2 - a^2}
   \]
   depending on which side is the hypotenuse.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Function otherside_rightangle(side1, side2):
       If side1 is greater than side2:
           hypotenuse = side1
           other_side = sqrt(hypotenuse^2 - side2^2)
       Else:
           hypotenuse = side2
           other_side = sqrt(hypotenuse^2 - side1^2)

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/293 [generation text] Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find the length of the third side of a right-angled triangle given the lengths of the other two sides. The assertion provided indicates that the function should return the length of the hypotenuse when given the lengths of the two other sides.

2. **Identifying the Error**: In the previous solution, I incorrectly assumed that one of the provided sides could be the hypotenuse. However, the problem statement implies that we are always given the two shorter sides of the triangle, and we need to calculate the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem.

3. **Correct Approach**: The correct formula to use is:
   \[
   c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
   \]
   where \(c\) is the hypotenuse, and \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the two sides provided. 

4. **Where I Went Wrong**: I mistakenly implemented a conditional check to determine which side was the hypotenuse, which is unnecessary since the problem specifies that we are given the two shorter sides. The function should simply calculate the hypotenuse using both sides directly.

Now, I will correct the implementation to ensure it calculates the hypotenuse correctly based on the two provided sides.

Here’s the corrected solution:

```python
import math

def otherside_rightangle(side1: float, side2: float) -> float:
    # Calculate the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem
    hypotenuse = math.sqrt(side1**2 + side2**2)
    return hypotenuse
