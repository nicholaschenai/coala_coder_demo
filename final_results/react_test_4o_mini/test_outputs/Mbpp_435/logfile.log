INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/435 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to find the last digit of a given number.
assert last_Digit(123) == 3

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/435 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes an integer as input and returns the last digit of that integer.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the last digit of a number, we can use the modulus operator. When we divide a number by 10, the remainder will be the last digit of that number. For example, for the number 123, when we do `123 % 10`, the result is 3, which is the last digit.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Function last_Digit(number):
       Return number modulo 10
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to find the last digit of a given number
def last_Digit(number):
    # Use the modulus operator to get the last digit
    return number % 10
```
