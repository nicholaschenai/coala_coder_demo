    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns the length of the longest subsequence within that string that reads the same forwards and backwards (a palindrome).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the longest palindromic subsequence, we can use dynamic programming. We will create a 2D array (table) where each cell represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence for a substring of the input string. We will fill this table based on the following rules:\n   - If the characters at the two ends of the substring are the same, the length of the palindromic subsequence is 2 plus the length of the palindromic subsequence of the substring without those two characters.\n   - If the characters are different, the length is the maximum of the lengths of the palindromic subsequences of the two possible substrings formed by removing one of the characters.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function lps(s):\n       n = length of s\n       create a 2D array dp of size n x n initialized to 0\n       \n       for i from 0 to n-1:\n           dp[i][i] = 1  // each character is a palindrome of length 1\n       \n       for length from 2 to n:\n           for start from 0 to n-length:\n               end = start + length - 1\n               if s[start] == s[end]:\n                   dp[start][end] = dp[start + 1][end - 1] + 2\n               else:\n                   dp[start][end] = max(dp[start + 1][end], dp[start][end - 1])\n       \n       return dp[0][n-1]  // the length of the longest palindromic subsequence\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef lps(s: str) -> int:\n    n = len(s)  # Get the length of the input string\n    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]  # Create a 2D array initialized to 0\n\n    # Each character is a palindrome of length 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        dp[i][i] = 1\n\n    # Fill the dp table\n    for length in range(2, n + 1):  # Length of the substring\n        for start in range(n - length + 1):  # Starting index of the substring\n            end = start + length - 1  # Ending index of the substring\n            if s[start] == s[end]:  # If characters match\n                dp[start][end] = dp[start + 1][end - 1] + 2  # Include both characters\n            else:  # If characters do not match\n                dp[start][end] = max(dp[start + 1][end], dp[start][end - 1])  # Take the max of two options\n\n    return dp[0][n - 1]  # Return the length of the longest palindromic subsequence\n```",
