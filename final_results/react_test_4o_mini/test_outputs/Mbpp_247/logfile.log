You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/247 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns the length of the longest subsequence within that string that reads the same forwards and backwards (a palindrome).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the longest palindromic subsequence, we can use dynamic programming. We will create a 2D array (table) where each cell represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence for a substring of the input string. We will fill this table based on the following rules:
   - If the characters at the two ends of the substring are the same, the length of the palindromic subsequence is 2 plus the length of the palindromic subsequence of the substring without those two characters.
   - If the characters are different, the length is the maximum of the lengths of the palindromic subsequences of the two possible substrings formed by removing one of the characters.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function lps(s):
       n = length of s
       create a 2D array dp of size n x n initialized to 0
       
       for i from 0 to n-1:
           dp[i][i] = 1  // each character is a palindrome of length 1
       
       for length from 2 to n:
           for start from 0 to n-length:
               end = start + length - 1
               if s[start] == s[end]:
                   dp[start][end] = dp[start + 1][end - 1] + 2
               else:
                   dp[start][end] = max(dp[start + 1][end], dp[start][end - 1])
       
       return dp[0][n-1]  // the length of the longest palindromic subsequence
   ```

def lps(s: str) -> int:
