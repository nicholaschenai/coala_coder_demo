You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/607 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that searches for a specific substring (pattern) within a given string. If the substring is found, the function should return the substring itself along with its starting and ending indices in the original string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use the built-in string methods in Python. We will search for the substring using the `find` method, which returns the starting index of the first occurrence of the substring. If the substring is found, we can calculate the ending index by adding the length of the substring to the starting index. Finally, we will return the substring along with its starting and ending indices.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_literals(string, pattern):
       start_index = string.find(pattern)  // Find the starting index of the pattern
       if start_index is not -1:  // Check if the pattern was found
           end_index = start_index + length of pattern  // Calculate the ending index
           return (pattern, start_index, end_index)  // Return the result
       else:
           return None  // Return None if the pattern is not found
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def find_literals(string: str, pattern: str) -> tuple:
    # Find the starting index of the pattern in the string
    start_index = string.find(pattern)
    
    # Check if the pattern was found
    if start_index != -1:
        # Calculate the ending index
        end_index = start_index + len(pattern)
        # Return the matching substring and its indices
        return (pattern, start_index, end_index)

        # Return None if the pattern is not found
