If the substring is found, the function should return the substring itself along with its starting and ending indices in the original string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use the built-in string methods in Python. We will search for the substring using the `find` method, which returns the starting index of the first occurrence of the substring. If the substring is found, we can calculate the ending index by adding the length of the substring to the starting index. Finally, we will return the substring along with its starting and ending indices.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_literals(string, pattern):\n       start_index = string.find(pattern)  // Find the starting index of the pattern\n       if start_index is not -1:  // Check if the pattern was found\n           end_index = start_index + length of pattern  // Calculate the ending index\n           return (pattern, start_index, end_index)  // Return the result\n       else:\n           return None  // Return None if the pattern is not found\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_literals(string: str, pattern: str) -> tuple:\n    # Find the starting index of the pattern in the string\n    start_index = string.find(pattern)\n    \n    # Check if the pattern was found\n    if start_index != -1:\n        # Calculate the ending index\n        end_index = start_index + len(pattern)\n        # Return the matching substring and its indices\n        return (pattern, start_index, end_index)\n    else:\n        # Return None if the pattern is not found\n        return None\n```"
