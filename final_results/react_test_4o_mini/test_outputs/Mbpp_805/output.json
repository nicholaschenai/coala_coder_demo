    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists (where each inner list contains numbers) and returns the inner list that has the highest sum of its elements.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate through each inner list in the main list.\n   - For each inner list, we will calculate the sum of its elements.\n   - We will keep track of the maximum sum found and the corresponding inner list.\n   - At the end of the iteration, we will return the inner list that has the highest sum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function max_sum_list(lists):\n       initialize max_sum to a very small number\n       initialize max_list to None\n       for each inner_list in lists:\n           calculate the sum of inner_list\n           if the sum is greater than max_sum:\n               update max_sum to this sum\n               update max_list to this inner_list\n       return max_list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef max_sum_list(lists):\n    # Initialize max_sum to a very small number\n    max_sum = float('-inf')\n    # Initialize max_list to None\n    max_list = None\n    \n    # Iterate through each inner list in the main list\n    for inner_list in lists:\n        # Calculate the sum of the current inner list\n        current_sum = sum(inner_list)\n        \n        # If the current sum is greater than the max_sum found so far\n        if current_sum > max_sum:\n            # Update max_sum to the current sum\n            max_sum = current_sum\n            # Update max_list to the current inner list\n            max_list = inner_list\n            \n    # Return the inner list with the highest sum\n    return max_list\n```",
