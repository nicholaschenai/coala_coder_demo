You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/805 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists (where each inner list contains numbers) and returns the inner list that has the highest sum of its elements.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each inner list in the main list.
   - For each inner list, we will calculate the sum of its elements.
   - We will keep track of the maximum sum found and the corresponding inner list.
   - At the end of the iteration, we will return the inner list that has the highest sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_sum_list(lists):
       initialize max_sum to a very small number
       initialize max_list to None
       for each inner_list in lists:
           calculate the sum of inner_list
           if the sum is greater than max_sum:
               update max_sum to this sum
               update max_list to this inner_list
       return max_list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def max_sum_list(lists):
    # Initialize max_sum to a very small number
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    # Initialize max_list to None
    max_list = None

    for inner_list in lists:
        # Calculate the sum of the current inner list
        current_sum = sum(inner_list)
