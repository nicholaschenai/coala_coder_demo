You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/448 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of the first `n` Perrin numbers, where `n` is provided as an input to the function. The function should return this sum.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   The Perrin sequence is defined as follows:
   - P(0) = 3
   - P(1) = 0
   - P(2) = 2
   - For n > 2, P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3)
   To solve the problem, we will:
   - Initialize the first three Perrin numbers.
   - Use a loop to calculate the Perrin numbers up to the nth number.
   - Sum these numbers as we calculate them.
   - Return the total sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function cal_sum(n):
       if n == 0:
           return 3
       if n == 1:
           return 3
       if n == 2:
           return 5
       
       initialize P0 = 3, P1 = 0, P2 = 2
       sum = P0 + P1 + P2
       
       for i from 3 to n:
           Pn = P(i-2) + P(i-3)
           add Pn to sum
           update P0, P1, P2 for next iteration
       
       return sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def cal_sum(n: int) -> int:
    # Handle the base cases for n = 0, 1, and 2
    if n == 0:
        return 3

        return 3
    if n == 2:

    # Initialize the first three Perrin numbers
    P0, P1, P2 = 3, 0, 2
    total_sum = P0 + P1 + P2  # Start the sum with the first three numbers
    
    # Calculate Perrin numbers from P(3) to P(n) and sum them
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        Pn = P0 + P1  # P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3)
        total_sum += Pn  # Add the current Perrin number to the sum
        
        # Update the previous Perrin numbers for the next iteration
        P0, P1, P2 = P1, P2, Pn
    
    return total_sum
