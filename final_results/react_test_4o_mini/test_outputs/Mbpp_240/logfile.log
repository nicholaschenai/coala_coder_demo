You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/240 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes two lists as input. The function should replace the last element of the first list with all the elements from the second list. The result should be a new list that combines the elements of the first list (up to the last element) with the elements of the second list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - First, we will check if the first list is not empty to avoid errors when trying to access the last element.
   - We will create a new list that consists of all elements from the first list except the last one.
   - Then, we will append all elements from the second list to this new list.
   - Finally, we will return the new list as the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function replace_list(list1, list2):
       if list1 is empty:
           return list2
       new_list = copy of list1 without the last element
       append all elements of list2 to new_list
       return new_list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def replace_list(list1, list2):
    # Check if the first list is empty
    if not list1:
        return list2  # If empty, return the second list
    
    # Create a new list with all elements of list1 except the last one
    new_list = list1[:-1]
    
    # Append all elements of list2 to the new list
    new_list.extend(list2)
    
    # Return the new list
    return new_list
