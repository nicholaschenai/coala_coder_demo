The function should replace the last element of the first list with all the elements from the second list. The result should be a new list that combines the elements of the first list (up to the last element) with the elements of the second list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - First, we will check if the first list is not empty to avoid errors when trying to access the last element.\n   - We will create a new list that consists of all elements from the first list except the last one.\n   - Then, we will append all elements from the second list to this new list.\n   - Finally, we will return the new list as the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function replace_list(list1, list2):\n       if list1 is empty:\n           return list2\n       new_list = copy of list1 without the last element\n       append all elements of list2 to new_list\n       return new_list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef replace_list(list1, list2):\n    # Check if the first list is empty\n    if not list1:\n        return list2  # If empty, return the second list\n    \n    # Create a new list with all elements of list1 except the last one\n    new_list = list1[:-1]\n    \n    # Append all elements of list2 to the new list\n    new_list.extend(list2)\n    \n    # Return the new list\n    return new_list\n```"
