    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes two tuples of the same length and computes the modulo of each corresponding pair of elements from the two tuples. The result should be a new tuple containing the results of these modulo operations.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Iterate through both tuples simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of elements (one from each tuple), we will calculate the modulo of the first element by the second.\n   - We will collect these results into a new tuple and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function tuple_modulo(tuple1, tuple2):\n       create an empty list to store results\n       for each index in the range of the length of tuple1:\n           calculate the modulo of tuple1[index] by tuple2[index]\n           append the result to the results list\n       convert the results list to a tuple\n       return the results tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef tuple_modulo(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Create an empty list to store results\n    results = []\n    \n    # Iterate through both tuples using their indices\n    for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n        # Calculate the modulo of the elements at the current index\n        mod_result = tuple1[i] % tuple2[i]\n        # Append the result to the results list\n        results.append(mod_result)\n    \n    # Convert the results list to a tuple\n    return tuple(results)\n```",
