You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/616 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes two tuples of the same length and computes the modulo of each corresponding pair of elements from the two tuples. The result should be a new tuple containing the results of these modulo operations.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Iterate through both tuples simultaneously.
   - For each pair of elements (one from each tuple), we will calculate the modulo of the first element by the second.
   - We will collect these results into a new tuple and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function tuple_modulo(tuple1, tuple2):
       create an empty list to store results
       for each index in the range of the length of tuple1:
           calculate the modulo of tuple1[index] by tuple2[index]
           append the result to the results list
       convert the results list to a tuple
       return the results tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def tuple_modulo(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Create an empty list to store results
    results = []
    
    # Iterate through both tuples using their indices
    for i in range(len(tuple1)):
        # Calculate the modulo of the elements at the current index
        mod_result = tuple1[i] % tuple2[i]
        # Append the result to the results list
        results.append(mod_result)
    
    # Convert the results list to a tuple
    return tuple(results)
