    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of words as input and returns the length of the longest word in that list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the longest word, we can iterate through each word in the list, check its length, and keep track of the maximum length we encounter. At the end of the iteration, we will have the length of the longest word.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function len_log(words):\n       initialize max_length to 0\n       for each word in words:\n           if length of word is greater than max_length:\n               update max_length to length of word\n       return max_length\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef len_log(words):\n    # Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum length found\n    max_length = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each word in the provided list\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if the current word's length is greater than the max_length\n        if len(word) > max_length:\n            # Update max_length to the length of the current word\n            max_length = len(word)\n    \n    # Return the maximum length found\n    return max_length\n```",
