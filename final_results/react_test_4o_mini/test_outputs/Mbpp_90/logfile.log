INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/90 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/90 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of words as input and returns the length of the longest word in that list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the longest word, we can iterate through each word in the list, check its length, and keep track of the maximum length we encounter. At the end of the iteration, we will have the length of the longest word.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function len_log(words):
       initialize max_length to 0
       for each word in words:
           if length of word is greater than max_length:
               update max_length to length of word
       return max_length
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def len_log(words):
    # Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum length found
    max_length = 0
    
    # Iterate through each word in the provided list
    for word in words:
        # Check if the current word's length is greater than the max_length
        if len(word) > max_length:
            # Update max_length to the length of the current word
            max_length = len(word)
    
    # Return the maximum length found
    return max_length
