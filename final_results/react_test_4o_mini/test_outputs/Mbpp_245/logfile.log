You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/245 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and finds the maximum sum of a subsequence that first increases and then decreases. This type of subsequence is called a "bitonic subsequence."

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can break it down into two main parts:
   - First, we will find the maximum sum of increasing subsequences that end at each index of the array.
   - Second, we will find the maximum sum of decreasing subsequences that start at each index of the array.
   - Finally, for each index, we will combine the results from the two parts to find the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence that peaks at that index.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_sum(arr):
       n = length of arr
       if n is 0:
           return 0
       
       create an array inc_sum of size n initialized to 0
       create an array dec_sum of size n initialized to 0
       
       for i from 0 to n-1:
           inc_sum[i] = arr[i]
           for j from 0 to i-1:
               if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                   inc_sum[i] = max(inc_sum[i], inc_sum[j] + arr[i])
       
       for i from n-1 to 0:
           dec_sum[i] = arr[i]
           for j from n-1 to i+1:
               if arr[j] < arr[i]:
                   dec_sum[i] = max(dec_sum[i], dec_sum[j] + arr[i])
       
       max_bitonic_sum = 0
       for i from 0 to n-1:
           max_bitonic_sum = max(max_bitonic_sum, inc_sum[i] + dec_sum[i] - arr[i])
