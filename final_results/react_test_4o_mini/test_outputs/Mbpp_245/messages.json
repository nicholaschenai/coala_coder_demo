This type of subsequence is called a \"bitonic subsequence.\"\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can break it down into two main parts:\n   - First, we will find the maximum sum of increasing subsequences that end at each index of the array.\n   - Second, we will find the maximum sum of decreasing subsequences that start at each index of the array.\n   - Finally, for each index, we will combine the results from the two parts to find the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence that peaks at that index.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function max_sum(arr):\n       n = length of arr\n       if n is 0:\n           return 0\n       \n       create an array inc_sum of size n initialized to 0\n       create an array dec_sum of size n initialized to 0\n       \n       for i from 0 to n-1:\n           inc_sum[i] = arr[i]\n           for j from 0 to i-1:\n               if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                   inc_sum[i] = max(inc_sum[i], inc_sum[j] + arr[i])\n       \n       for i from n-1 to 0:\n           dec_sum[i] = arr[i]\n           for j from n-1 to i+1:\n               if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                   dec_sum[i] = max(dec_sum[i], dec_sum[j] + arr[i])\n       \n       max_bitonic_sum = 0\n       for i from 0 to n-1:\n           max_bitonic_sum = max(max_bitonic_sum, inc_sum[i] + dec_sum[i] - arr[i])\n       \n       return max_bitonic_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef max_sum(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Create arrays to store the maximum sum of increasing subsequences\n    inc_sum = [0] * n\n    # Create arrays to store the maximum sum of decreasing subsequences\n    dec_sum = [0] * n\n    \n    # Fill inc_sum array\n    for i in range(n):\n        inc_sum[i] = arr[i]  # Start with the value itself\n        for j in range(i):\n            if arr[j] < arr[i]:  # Check for increasing condition\n                inc_sum[i] = max(inc_sum[i], inc_sum[j] + arr[i])\n    \n    # Fill dec_sum array\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        dec_sum[i] = arr[i]  # Start with the value itself\n        for j in range(n-1, i, -1):\n            if arr[j] < arr[i]:  # Check for decreasing condition\n                dec_sum[i] = max(dec_sum[i], dec_sum[j] + arr[i])\n    \n    # Calculate the maximum sum of bitonic subsequence\n    max_bitonic_sum = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        max_bitonic_sum = max(max_bitonic_sum, inc_sum[i] + dec_sum[i] - arr[i])\n    \n    return max_bitonic_sum\n```"
