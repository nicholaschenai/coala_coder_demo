    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the volume of a cube based on the length of one of its sides. The volume of a cube is found by raising the side length to the power of three.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the volume of a cube, we will take the side length as input and compute the volume by multiplying the side length by itself three times (or raising it to the power of three). The result will be returned as the output of the function.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION volume_cube(side_length):\n       RETURN side_length * side_length * side_length\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the volume of a cube\ndef volume_cube(side_length: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the volume by cubing the side length\n    return side_length * side_length * side_length\n```",
