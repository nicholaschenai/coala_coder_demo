INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/234 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/234 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the volume of a cube based on the length of one of its sides. The volume of a cube is found by raising the side length to the power of three.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the volume of a cube, we will take the side length as input and compute the volume by multiplying the side length by itself three times (or raising it to the power of three). The result will be returned as the output of the function.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION volume_cube(side_length):
       RETURN side_length * side_length * side_length
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to calculate the volume of a cube
def volume_cube(side_length: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the volume by cubing the side length
    return side_length * side_length * side_length
```
