Each tuple contains numbers, and we want to subtract the corresponding elements of the first tuple from the second tuple. The result should be a new tuple containing the differences.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Define a function that accepts two tuples.\n   - Initialize an empty list to store the results of the subtractions.\n   - Loop through the elements of both tuples using their indices.\n   - For each index, subtract the element of the second tuple from the element of the first tuple and store the result in the list.\n   - Finally, convert the list back to a tuple and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function substract_elements(tuple1, tuple2):\n       create an empty list result\n       for index from 0 to length of tuple1:\n           difference = tuple1[index] - tuple2[index]\n           append difference to result\n       return tuple(result)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef substract_elements(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Create an empty list to store the results\n    result = []\n    \n    # Loop through the indices of the tuples\n    for index in range(len(tuple1)):\n        # Subtract the element of the second tuple from the first\n        difference = tuple1[index] - tuple2[index]\n        # Append the result to the list\n        result.append(difference)\n    \n    # Convert the list back to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(result)\n```"
