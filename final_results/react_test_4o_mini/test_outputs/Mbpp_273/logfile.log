You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/273 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes two tuples as input. Each tuple contains numbers, and we want to subtract the corresponding elements of the first tuple from the second tuple. The result should be a new tuple containing the differences.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Define a function that accepts two tuples.
   - Initialize an empty list to store the results of the subtractions.
   - Loop through the elements of both tuples using their indices.
   - For each index, subtract the element of the second tuple from the element of the first tuple and store the result in the list.
   - Finally, convert the list back to a tuple and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function substract_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
       create an empty list result
       for index from 0 to length of tuple1:
           difference = tuple1[index] - tuple2[index]
           append difference to result
       return tuple(result)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def substract_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Create an empty list to store the results
    result = []
    
    # Loop through the indices of the tuples
    for index in range(len(tuple1)):
        # Subtract the element of the second tuple from the first
        difference = tuple1[index] - tuple2[index]
        # Append the result to the list
        result.append(difference)
    
    # Convert the list back to a tuple and return it
    return tuple(result)
