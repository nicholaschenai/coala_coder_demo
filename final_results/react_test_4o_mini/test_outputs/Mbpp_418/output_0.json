    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the sublist that has the most elements. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, we will return the first one encountered.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - We will iterate through each sublist in the main list.\n   - For each sublist, we will check its length.\n   - We will keep track of the longest sublist found so far.\n   - At the end of the iteration, we will return the longest sublist.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function Find_Max(list_of_lists):\n       initialize max_length to 0\n       initialize max_list to None\n       for each sublist in list_of_lists:\n           if length of sublist is greater than max_length:\n               update max_length to length of sublist\n               update max_list to sublist\n       return max_list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef Find_Max(list_of_lists):\n    # Initialize the maximum length and the corresponding sublist\n    max_length = 0\n    max_list = None\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the input list\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        # Check if the current sublist is longer than the max_length found so far\n        if len(sublist) > max_length:\n            # Update max_length and max_list with the current sublist\n            max_length = len(sublist)\n            max_list = sublist\n            \n    # Return the sublist with the maximum length\n    return max_list\n```",
