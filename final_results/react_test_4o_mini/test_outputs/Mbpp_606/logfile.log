You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/606 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that converts an angle given in degrees to its equivalent in radians. The function should take a single input (the angle in degrees) and return the angle in radians.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To convert degrees to radians, we can use the mathematical relationship that Ï€ radians is equal to 180 degrees. Therefore, to convert degrees to radians, we can multiply the degree value by Ï€ and then divide by 180. We can use the built-in constant `math.pi` for the value of Ï€.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION radian_degree(degrees):
       SET pi = 3.141592653589793
       SET radians = (degrees * pi) / 180
       RETURN radians
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def radian_degree(degrees):
    # Define the value of pi
    pi = 3.141592653589793
    # Convert degrees to radians using the formula
    radians = (degrees * pi) / 180
    # Return the calculated radians
    return radians
