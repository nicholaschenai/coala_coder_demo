The function should take a single input (the angle in degrees) and return the angle in radians.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To convert degrees to radians, we can use the mathematical relationship that \u03c0 radians is equal to 180 degrees. Therefore, to convert degrees to radians, we can multiply the degree value by \u03c0 and then divide by 180. We can use the built-in constant `math.pi` for the value of \u03c0.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION radian_degree(degrees):\n       SET pi = 3.141592653589793\n       SET radians = (degrees * pi) / 180\n       RETURN radians\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef radian_degree(degrees):\n    # Define the value of pi\n    pi = 3.141592653589793\n    # Convert degrees to radians using the formula\n    radians = (degrees * pi) / 180\n    # Return the calculated radians\n    return radians\n```"
