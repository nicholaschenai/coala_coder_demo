INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/404 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/404 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that takes two numbers as input and returns the smaller of the two numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the minimum of two numbers, we can compare the two numbers using a simple conditional statement. If the first number is less than or equal to the second number, we return the first number; otherwise, we return the second number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION minimum(a, b):
       IF a is less than or equal to b:
           RETURN a
       ELSE:
           RETURN b
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to find the minimum of two numbers
def minimum(a, b):
    # Check if the first number is less than or equal to the second
    if a <= b:
        # If true, return the first number
        return a
    else:
        # Otherwise, return the second number
        return b
```
