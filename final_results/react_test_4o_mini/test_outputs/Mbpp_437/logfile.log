Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/437 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string that contains only the characters from the original string that are located at even indices. In other words, we want to remove characters that are at odd positions in the string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string and check the index of each character. If the index is even, we will keep that character; if it is odd, we will skip it. We can then combine all the kept characters into a new string and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function remove_odd(input_string):
       create an empty string result
       for index from 0 to length of input_string - 1:
           if index is even:
               append input_string[index] to result
       return result
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/437 [generation text] Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Requirement**: The function is supposed to return characters from the input string that are located at odd indices (1-based counting). In the example provided, "python", the characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5) are 'y', 'h', and 'n', which should be returned as "yhn".

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: In my previous solution, I mistakenly interpreted the requirement to keep characters at even indices (0-based counting) instead of odd indices. This led to the inclusion of characters 'p', 't', and 'o' instead of the correct characters.

3. **Correcting the Logic**: To fix the code, I need to change the condition to check for odd indices. In Python, this means checking if the index is odd using `index % 2 != 0`.

4. **Revising the Pseudocode**:
   ```
   function remove_odd(input_string):
       create an empty string result
       for index from 0 to length of input_string - 1:
           if index is odd:
               append input_string[index] to result
       return result
   ```

5. **Updating the Python Code**: I will now implement the corrected logic in the Python function.

Here is the revised code:
```python
def remove_odd(input_string: str) -> str:
    # Create an empty string to store the result
    result = ""
    # Iterate through the input string using its indices
    for index in range(len(input_string)):
        # Check if the index is odd
        if index % 2 != 0:
            # Append the character at the odd index to the result
            result += input_string[index]
    # Return the final result string
