INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/565 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/565 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a list of its individual characters.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can iterate over each character in the input string and collect them into a list. This can be done using a simple loop or by utilizing Python's built-in capabilities to convert the string into a list of characters.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Function split(input_string):
       Initialize an empty list called character_list
       For each character in input_string:
           Append the character to character_list
       Return character_list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def split(input_string: str) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to hold the characters
    character_list = []
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for character in input_string:
        # Append the character to the list
        character_list.append(character)
    
    # Return the list of characters
    return character_list
