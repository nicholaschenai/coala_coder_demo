    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the smallest of those three numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the minimum of three numbers, we can compare the first number with the second and third numbers. We will keep track of the smallest number found during these comparisons and return it at the end.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Function min_of_three(a, b, c):\n       Initialize min_value to a\n       If b is less than min_value:\n           Set min_value to b\n       If c is less than min_value:\n           Set min_value to c\n       Return min_value\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to find the minimum of three numbers\ndef min_of_three(a, b, c):\n    # Initialize min_value to the first number\n    min_value = a\n    # Compare with the second number\n    if b < min_value:\n        min_value = b\n    # Compare with the third number\n    if c < min_value:\n        min_value = c\n    # Return the smallest number found\n    return min_value\n```",
