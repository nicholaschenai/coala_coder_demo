You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/227 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the smallest of those three numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the minimum of three numbers, we can compare the first number with the second and third numbers. We will keep track of the smallest number found during these comparisons and return it at the end.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Function min_of_three(a, b, c):
       Initialize min_value to a
       If b is less than min_value:
           Set min_value to b
       If c is less than min_value:
           Set min_value to c
       Return min_value
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to find the minimum of three numbers
def min_of_three(a, b, c):
    # Initialize min_value to the first number
    min_value = a
    # Compare with the second number
    if b < min_value:
        min_value = b
    # Compare with the third number
    if c < min_value:
        min_value = c
    # Return the smallest number found
    return min_value
