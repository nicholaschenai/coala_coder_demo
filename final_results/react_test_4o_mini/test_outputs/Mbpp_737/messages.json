The function should use regular expressions to perform this check.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will use a regular expression that matches strings starting with any of the vowels. We will define a function that takes a string as input, applies the regex pattern, and returns `True` if the string starts with a vowel and `False` otherwise.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function named `check_str` that takes a string as an argument.\n   - Use a regular expression to check if the string starts with a vowel.\n   - Return `True` if it matches, otherwise return `False`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\nimport re  # Importing the regex module\n\n# Define a function to check if the string starts with a vowel\ndef check_str(s: str) -> bool:\n    # Define a regex pattern that matches a string starting with a vowel\n    pattern = r'^[aeiouAEIOU]'  # ^ asserts position at the start of the string\n    # Use re.match to check if the string matches the pattern\n    return re.match(pattern, s) is not None  # Return True if it matches, otherwise False\n```"
