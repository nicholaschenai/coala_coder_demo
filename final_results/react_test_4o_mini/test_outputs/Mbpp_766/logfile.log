You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/766 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of items and returns a new list containing pairs of consecutive items from the original list. Each pair should be represented as a tuple.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the given list and for each item, we will create a tuple with the current item and the next item. We will continue this until we reach the second-to-last item in the list, as the last item does not have a consecutive item to pair with.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function pair_wise(input_list):
       initialize an empty list called result
       for i from 0 to length of input_list - 2:
           create a tuple with input_list[i] and input_list[i + 1]
           append this tuple to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def pair_wise(input_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through the list up to the second-to-last item
    for i in range(len(input_list) - 1):
        # Create a tuple of the current item and the next item
        pair = (input_list[i], input_list[i + 1])
        # Append the tuple to the result list
        result.append(pair)
    
    # Return the list of pairs
    return result
