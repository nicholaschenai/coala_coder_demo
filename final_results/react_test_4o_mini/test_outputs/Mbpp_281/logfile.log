You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to check if the elements of a given list are unique or not.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/281 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if all the elements in a given list are unique. If all elements are unique, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if all elements in the list are unique, we can use a set to keep track of the elements we have seen so far. As we iterate through the list, we will check if each element is already in the set. If it is, that means we have a duplicate, and we can return `False`. If we finish checking all elements without finding duplicates, we return `True`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function all_unique(input_list):
       create an empty set called seen
       for each element in input_list:
           if element is in seen:
               return False
           add element to seen
       return True
   ```

def all_unique(input_list):
    # Create an empty set to keep track of seen elements
    seen = set()
    
    # Iterate through each element in the input list

        # If the element is already in the seen set, return False
        if element in seen:
            return False
        # Add the element to the seen set
        seen.add(element)
    
    # If no duplicates were found, return True
