If all elements are unique, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if all elements in the list are unique, we can use a set to keep track of the elements we have seen so far. As we iterate through the list, we will check if each element is already in the set. If it is, that means we have a duplicate, and we can return `False`. If we finish checking all elements without finding duplicates, we return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function all_unique(input_list):\n       create an empty set called seen\n       for each element in input_list:\n           if element is in seen:\n               return False\n           add element to seen\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef all_unique(input_list):\n    # Create an empty set to keep track of seen elements\n    seen = set()\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the input list\n    for element in input_list:\n        # If the element is already in the seen set, return False\n        if element in seen:\n            return False\n        # Add the element to the seen set\n        seen.add(element)\n    \n    # If no duplicates were found, return True\n    return True\n```"
