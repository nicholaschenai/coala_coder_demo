    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The task is to create a function that calculates the nth centered hexagonal number. The centered hexagonal numbers are a sequence of numbers that can be arranged in a hexagonal pattern, and we need to find the specific number in this sequence based on the input n.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To find the nth centered hexagonal number, we can use the formula for centered hexagonal numbers, which is given by:\n   \\[\n   H(n) = 3n(n - 1) + 1\n   \\]\n   This formula allows us to compute the nth centered hexagonal number directly without needing to generate all previous numbers in the sequence.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   FUNCTION centered_hexagonal_number(n):\n       RETURN 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the nth centered hexagonal number\ndef centered_hexagonal_number(n):\n    # Use the formula for centered hexagonal numbers\n    return 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1\n```",
