You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/86 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that calculates the nth centered hexagonal number. The centered hexagonal numbers are a sequence of numbers that can be arranged in a hexagonal pattern, and we need to find the specific number in this sequence based on the input n.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the nth centered hexagonal number, we can use the formula for centered hexagonal numbers, which is given by:
   \[
   H(n) = 3n(n - 1) + 1
   \]
   This formula allows us to compute the nth centered hexagonal number directly without needing to generate all previous numbers in the sequence.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   FUNCTION centered_hexagonal_number(n):
       RETURN 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
# Define a function to calculate the nth centered hexagonal number
def centered_hexagonal_number(n):
    # Use the formula for centered hexagonal numbers
    return 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1
```
