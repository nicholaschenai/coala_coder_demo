INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/424 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple.
assert extract_rear(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers') ) == ['s', 'r', 's']

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/424 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in that tuple.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each string in the tuple, extract the last character of each string, and store these characters in a list. Finally, we will return this list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Define a function extract_rear that takes a tuple of strings as input
   Initialize an empty list to hold the last characters
   For each string in the input tuple:
       Get the last character of the string
       Append the last character to the list
   Return the list of last characters
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def extract_rear(strings: tuple) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to hold the last characters
    last_characters = []
    
    # Iterate through each string in the input tuple
    for string in strings:
        # Get the last character of the string
        last_character = string[-1]
        # Append the last character to the list
        last_characters.append(last_character)
    
    # Return the list of last characters
    return last_characters
