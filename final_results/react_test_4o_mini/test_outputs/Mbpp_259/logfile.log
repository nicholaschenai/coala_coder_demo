You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/259 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes two tuples of pairs of numbers. For each pair in the first tuple, we want to compare it with the corresponding pair in the second tuple and create a new tuple where each pair consists of the maximum value from the two pairs.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through both tuples simultaneously.
   - For each pair of tuples, we will compare the first elements and the second elements.
   - We will create a new tuple where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements from the two input tuples.
   - Finally, we will return the new tuple containing the maximum values.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function maximize_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
       create an empty list to hold the result
       for each pair in tuple1 and tuple2:
           find the maximum of the first elements
           find the maximum of the second elements
           create a new pair with these maximums
           add this new pair to the result list
       convert the result list to a tuple
       return the result tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def maximize_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Create an empty list to hold the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through both tuples simultaneously
    for (a, b), (c, d) in zip(tuple1, tuple2):
        # Find the maximum of the first elements
        max_first = max(a, c)
        # Find the maximum of the second elements
        max_second = max(b, d)
        # Create a new pair with these maximums
        result.append((max_first, max_second))
    
    # Convert the result list to a tuple
    return tuple(result)
