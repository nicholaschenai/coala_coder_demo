    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes two tuples of pairs of numbers. For each pair in the first tuple, we want to compare it with the corresponding pair in the second tuple and create a new tuple where each pair consists of the maximum value from the two pairs.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate through both tuples simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of tuples, we will compare the first elements and the second elements.\n   - We will create a new tuple where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements from the two input tuples.\n   - Finally, we will return the new tuple containing the maximum values.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function maximize_elements(tuple1, tuple2):\n       create an empty list to hold the result\n       for each pair in tuple1 and tuple2:\n           find the maximum of the first elements\n           find the maximum of the second elements\n           create a new pair with these maximums\n           add this new pair to the result list\n       convert the result list to a tuple\n       return the result tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef maximize_elements(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Create an empty list to hold the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through both tuples simultaneously\n    for (a, b), (c, d) in zip(tuple1, tuple2):\n        # Find the maximum of the first elements\n        max_first = max(a, c)\n        # Find the maximum of the second elements\n        max_second = max(b, d)\n        # Create a new pair with these maximums\n        result.append((max_first, max_second))\n    \n    # Convert the result list to a tuple\n    return tuple(result)\n```",
