For example, if `n` is 2, we should find the sum of the fourth powers of the first two odd numbers (1 and 3).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Generate the first `n` odd natural numbers.\n   - Calculate the fourth power of each of these numbers.\n   - Sum all these fourth powers together and return the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function odd_num_sum(n):\n       initialize sum to 0\n       for i from 0 to n-1:\n           odd_number = 2 * i + 1  // This generates the first n odd numbers\n           fourth_power = odd_number ** 4  // Calculate the fourth power\n           add fourth_power to sum\n       return sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef odd_num_sum(n):\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Loop through the first n odd numbers\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Generate the i-th odd number\n        odd_number = 2 * i + 1\n        \n        # Calculate the fourth power of the odd number\n        fourth_power = odd_number ** 4\n        \n        # Add the fourth power to the total sum\n        total_sum += fourth_power\n    \n    # Return the final sum\n    return total_sum\n```"
