You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/770 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of the fourth powers of the first `n` odd natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, we should find the sum of the fourth powers of the first two odd numbers (1 and 3).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Generate the first `n` odd natural numbers.
   - Calculate the fourth power of each of these numbers.
   - Sum all these fourth powers together and return the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function odd_num_sum(n):
       initialize sum to 0
       for i from 0 to n-1:
           odd_number = 2 * i + 1  // This generates the first n odd numbers
           fourth_power = odd_number ** 4  // Calculate the fourth power
           add fourth_power to sum
       return sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def odd_num_sum(n):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Loop through the first n odd numbers
    for i in range(n):
        # Generate the i-th odd number
        odd_number = 2 * i + 1
        
        # Calculate the fourth power of the odd number
        fourth_power = odd_number ** 4
        
        # Add the fourth power to the total sum
        total_sum += fourth_power
    
    # Return the final sum
    return total_sum
```
