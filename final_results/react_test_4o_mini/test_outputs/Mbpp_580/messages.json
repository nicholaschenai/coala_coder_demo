The function should return a new tuple that retains the structure of the original tuple but only includes even integers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we will need to iterate through the elements of the tuple. If an element is an integer, we will check if it is even. If it is even, we will keep it; if it is odd, we will discard it. If an element is another tuple, we will need to apply the same logic recursively to that tuple. The final result will be a new tuple that contains only the even integers, preserving the original structure.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function extract_even(nested_tuple):\n       create an empty list to hold the result\n       for each element in nested_tuple:\n           if the element is an integer:\n               if the integer is even:\n                   add it to the result list\n           else if the element is a tuple:\n               recursively call extract_even on the element and add the result to the result list\n       convert the result list back to a tuple\n       return the new tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef extract_even(nested_tuple):\n    # Create an empty list to hold the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the nested tuple\n    for element in nested_tuple:\n        # Check if the element is an integer\n        if isinstance(element, int):\n            # If it is even, add it to the result list\n            if element % 2 == 0:\n                result.append(element)\n        # Check if the element is a tuple\n        elif isinstance(element, tuple):\n            # Recursively call extract_even on the tuple and add the result to the result list\n            result.append(extract_even(element))\n    \n    # Convert the result list back to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(result)\n```"
