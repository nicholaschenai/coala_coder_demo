You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/580 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a nested tuple containing integers and removes any odd integers from it. The function should return a new tuple that retains the structure of the original tuple but only includes even integers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will need to iterate through the elements of the tuple. If an element is an integer, we will check if it is even. If it is even, we will keep it; if it is odd, we will discard it. If an element is another tuple, we will need to apply the same logic recursively to that tuple. The final result will be a new tuple that contains only the even integers, preserving the original structure.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function extract_even(nested_tuple):
       create an empty list to hold the result
       for each element in nested_tuple:
           if the element is an integer:
               if the integer is even:
                   add it to the result list
           else if the element is a tuple:
               recursively call extract_even on the element and add the result to the result list
       convert the result list back to a tuple
       return the new tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def extract_even(nested_tuple):
    # Create an empty list to hold the result
