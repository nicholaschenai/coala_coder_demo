You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/222 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks whether all the elements in a given tuple are of the same data type. If they are, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can take the following steps:
   - First, we will check if the tuple is empty. If it is, we can return `True` since there are no elements to compare.
   - Next, we will take the data type of the first element in the tuple as a reference.
   - We will then iterate through the rest of the elements in the tuple and compare their data types to the reference type.
   - If we find any element with a different data type, we will return `False`. If we finish checking all elements without finding a mismatch, we will return `True`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function check_type(tuple):
       if tuple is empty:
           return True
       reference_type = type of the first element in tuple
       for each element in tuple starting from the second:
           if type of element is not equal to reference_type:
               return False
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def check_type(tup):
    # Check if the tuple is empty
    if not tup:
        return True
    
    # Get the type of the first element as a reference
    reference_type = type(tup[0])
    
    # Iterate through the tuple starting from the second element
    for element in tup[1:]:
        # Compare the type of each element with the reference type
        if type(element) != reference_type:
            return False
    
    # If all elements have the same type, return True
