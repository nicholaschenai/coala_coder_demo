You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/61 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that counts how many substrings of a given string of digits have a sum of their digits equal to the length of the substring itself.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible substrings of the input string. For each substring, we will calculate the sum of its digits and compare this sum to the length of the substring. If they are equal, we will increment our count. Finally, we will return the total count of such substrings.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_Substrings(s):
       initialize count to 0
       for start index from 0 to length of s - 1:
           for end index from start index + 1 to length of s:
               substring = s[start index:end index]
               calculate sum of digits in substring
               if sum of digits equals length of substring:
                   increment count
       return count
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def count_Substrings(s: str) -> int:
    # Initialize a counter for valid substrings
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over all possible starting points for substrings
    for start in range(len(s)):
        # Iterate over all possible ending points for substrings
        for end in range(start + 1, len(s) + 1):
            # Extract the substring
            substring = s[start:end]
            # Calculate the sum of digits in the substring
            digit_sum = sum(int(char) for char in substring)
            # Check if the sum of digits equals the length of the substring
            if digit_sum == len(substring):
                count += 1  # Increment the count if they are equal
