For each substring, we will calculate the sum of its digits and compare this sum to the length of the substring. If they are equal, we will increment our count. Finally, we will return the total count of such substrings.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_Substrings(s):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for start index from 0 to length of s - 1:\n           for end index from start index + 1 to length of s:\n               substring = s[start index:end index]\n               calculate sum of digits in substring\n               if sum of digits equals length of substring:\n                   increment count\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef count_Substrings(s: str) -> int:\n    # Initialize a counter for valid substrings\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over all possible starting points for substrings\n    for start in range(len(s)):\n        # Iterate over all possible ending points for substrings\n        for end in range(start + 1, len(s) + 1):\n            # Extract the substring\n            substring = s[start:end]\n            # Calculate the sum of digits in the substring\n            digit_sum = sum(int(char) for char in substring)\n            # Check if the sum of digits equals the length of the substring\n            if digit_sum == len(substring):\n                count += 1  # Increment the count if they are equal\n                \n    return count  # Return the total count of valid substrings\n```"
