For example, if the list is `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and the value to insert is `6`, the function should return `4`, which is the index where `6` would be placed.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the sorted list and compare each element with the value we want to insert. We will keep track of the index where the value is less than or equal to the current element. If we reach the end of the list without finding a larger element, the insertion point will be at the end of the list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function right_insertion(sorted_list, value):\n       for index from 0 to length of sorted_list:\n           if index is equal to length of sorted_list:\n               return index\n           if sorted_list[index] is greater than or equal to value:\n               return index\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef right_insertion(sorted_list, value):\n    # Iterate through the sorted list\n    for index in range(len(sorted_list)):\n        # If we reach the end of the list, return the index\n        if index == len(sorted_list):\n            return index\n        # If the current element is greater than or equal to the value\n        if sorted_list[index] >= value:\n            return index\n    # If the value is greater than all elements, return the length of the list\n    return len(sorted_list)\n```"
