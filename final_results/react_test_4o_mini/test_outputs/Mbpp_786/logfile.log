You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/786 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that finds the correct index where a given value should be inserted into a sorted list, such that the list remains sorted after the insertion. For example, if the list is `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and the value to insert is `6`, the function should return `4`, which is the index where `6` would be placed.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the sorted list and compare each element with the value we want to insert. We will keep track of the index where the value is less than or equal to the current element. If we reach the end of the list without finding a larger element, the insertion point will be at the end of the list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function right_insertion(sorted_list, value):
       for index from 0 to length of sorted_list:
           if index is equal to length of sorted_list:
               return index
           if sorted_list[index] is greater than or equal to value:
               return index
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def right_insertion(sorted_list, value):
    # Iterate through the sorted list
    for index in range(len(sorted_list)):
        # If we reach the end of the list, return the index
        if index == len(sorted_list):
            return index
        # If the current element is greater than or equal to the value
        if sorted_list[index] >= value:
            return index
    # If the value is greater than all elements, return the length of the list
    return len(sorted_list)
