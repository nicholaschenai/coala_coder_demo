You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function that returns the perimeter of a square given its side length as input.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/17 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the perimeter of a square when given the length of one of its sides. The perimeter of a square is the total distance around it, which can be calculated by multiplying the length of one side by 4.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the perimeter of a square, we will take the side length as input and multiply it by 4. This will give us the total length of all four sides combined. 

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION square_perimeter(side_length):
       PERIMETER = side_length * 4
       RETURN PERIMETER
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to calculate the perimeter of a square
def square_perimeter(side_length):
    # Calculate the perimeter by multiplying the side length by 4
    perimeter = side_length * 4
    # Return the calculated perimeter
    return perimeter
```
