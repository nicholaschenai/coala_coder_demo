    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the perimeter of a square when given the length of one of its sides. The perimeter of a square is the total distance around it, which can be calculated by multiplying the length of one side by 4.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the perimeter of a square, we will take the side length as input and multiply it by 4. This will give us the total length of all four sides combined. \n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION square_perimeter(side_length):\n       PERIMETER = side_length * 4\n       RETURN PERIMETER\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the perimeter of a square\ndef square_perimeter(side_length):\n    # Calculate the perimeter by multiplying the side length by 4\n    perimeter = side_length * 4\n    # Return the calculated perimeter\n    return perimeter\n```",
