You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/568 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that generates a list containing a specified number of empty dictionaries. The number of dictionaries is provided as an input parameter to the function.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we need to define a function that takes an integer `N` as input. The function will then create a list that contains `N` empty dictionaries. We can achieve this by using a loop or a list comprehension to generate the required number of empty dictionaries and store them in a list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION empty_list(N):
       CREATE an empty list called result
       FOR i from 0 to N-1:
           APPEND an empty dictionary to result
       RETURN result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function that creates a list of N empty dictionaries
def empty_list(N):
    # Initialize an empty list to hold the dictionaries
    result = []
    # Loop N times to create N empty dictionaries
    for i in range(N):
        # Append an empty dictionary to the result list
        result.append({})
    # Return the list of empty dictionaries
    return result
