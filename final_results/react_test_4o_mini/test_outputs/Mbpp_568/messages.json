The number of dictionaries is provided as an input parameter to the function.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to define a function that takes an integer `N` as input. The function will then create a list that contains `N` empty dictionaries. We can achieve this by using a loop or a list comprehension to generate the required number of empty dictionaries and store them in a list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION empty_list(N):\n       CREATE an empty list called result\n       FOR i from 0 to N-1:\n           APPEND an empty dictionary to result\n       RETURN result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function that creates a list of N empty dictionaries\ndef empty_list(N):\n    # Initialize an empty list to hold the dictionaries\n    result = []\n    # Loop N times to create N empty dictionaries\n    for i in range(N):\n        # Append an empty dictionary to the result list\n        result.append({})\n    # Return the list of empty dictionaries\n    return result\n```"
