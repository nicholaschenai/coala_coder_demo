You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to reverse only the vowels of a given string (where y is not a vowel).

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/131 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and reverses only the vowels in that string. The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' (both uppercase and lowercase). The letter 'y' is not considered a vowel for this task. If there are no vowels in the string, it should return the string unchanged.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Identify all the vowels in the input string and store them in a list.
   - Reverse the list of vowels.
   - Create a new string by replacing the vowels in the original string with the reversed vowels, while keeping the positions of the consonants unchanged.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function reverse_vowels(s):
       define a list of vowels
       create an empty list to hold the vowels found in the string
       iterate through the string:
           if the character is a vowel:
               add it to the list of found vowels
       reverse the list of found vowels
       create an empty list for the result
       set a vowel index to 0
       iterate through the string again:
           if the character is a vowel:
               add the next vowel from the reversed list to the result
           else:
               add the character as is to the result
       join the result list into a string and return it
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def reverse_vowels(s: str) -> str:
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"  # Define the vowels
    found_vowels = []  # List to store the vowels found in the string
    
    # Collect all vowels from the string
    for char in s:
        if char in vowels:
            found_vowels.append(char)
    
    # Reverse the list of found vowels
    found_vowels.reverse()
    
    result = []  # List to build the result string
    vowel_index = 0  # Index to track the position in the reversed vowels list
    
    # Build the result string
    for char in s:
        if char in vowels:
            result.append(found_vowels[vowel_index])  # Replace with reversed vowel
            vowel_index += 1  # Move to the next vowel in the reversed list
        else:
            result.append(char)  # Keep the consonant as is
    
    return ''.join(result)  # Join the list into a string and return
