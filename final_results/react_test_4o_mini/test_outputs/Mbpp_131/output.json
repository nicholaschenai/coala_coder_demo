    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and reverses only the vowels in that string. The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' (both uppercase and lowercase). The letter 'y' is not considered a vowel for this task. If there are no vowels in the string, it should return the string unchanged.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - Identify all the vowels in the input string and store them in a list.\n   - Reverse the list of vowels.\n   - Create a new string by replacing the vowels in the original string with the reversed vowels, while keeping the positions of the consonants unchanged.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function reverse_vowels(s):\n       define a list of vowels\n       create an empty list to hold the vowels found in the string\n       iterate through the string:\n           if the character is a vowel:\n               add it to the list of found vowels\n       reverse the list of found vowels\n       create an empty list for the result\n       set a vowel index to 0\n       iterate through the string again:\n           if the character is a vowel:\n               add the next vowel from the reversed list to the result\n           else:\n               add the character as is to the result\n       join the result list into a string and return it\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef reverse_vowels(s: str) -> str:\n    vowels = \"aeiouAEIOU\"  # Define the vowels\n    found_vowels = []  # List to store the vowels found in the string\n    \n    # Collect all vowels from the string\n    for char in s:\n        if char in vowels:\n            found_vowels.append(char)\n    \n    # Reverse the list of found vowels\n    found_vowels.reverse()\n    \n    result = []  # List to build the result string\n    vowel_index = 0  # Index to track the position in the reversed vowels list\n    \n    # Build the result string\n    for char in s:\n        if char in vowels:\n            result.append(found_vowels[vowel_index])  # Replace with reversed vowel\n            vowel_index += 1  # Move to the next vowel in the reversed list\n        else:\n            result.append(char)  # Keep the consonant as is\n    \n    return ''.join(result)  # Join the list into a string and return\n```",
