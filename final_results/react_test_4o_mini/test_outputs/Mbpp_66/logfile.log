You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to count the number of positive numbers in a list.
assert pos_count([1,-2,3,-4]) == 2

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/66 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and counts how many of those numbers are positive (greater than zero).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each number in the list, check if it is positive, and maintain a count of how many positive numbers we find. At the end of the iteration, we will return the count.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function pos_count(numbers):
       initialize count to 0
       for each number in numbers:
           if number is greater than 0:
               increment count by 1
       return count
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def pos_count(numbers):
    # Initialize a counter for positive numbers
    count = 0
    # Iterate through each number in the provided list
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the number is positive
        if number > 0:
            # Increment the count for each positive number
            count += 1
    # Return the total count of positive numbers
    return count
```
