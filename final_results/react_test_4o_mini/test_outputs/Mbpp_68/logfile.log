You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/68 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a given list of numbers is monotonic. A list is considered monotonic if it is either entirely non-increasing (each number is less than or equal to the previous one) or entirely non-decreasing (each number is greater than or equal to the previous one).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To determine if the list is monotonic, we can iterate through the list and check the relationship between each pair of adjacent elements. We will keep track of whether we have seen an increase or a decrease. If we see both an increase and a decrease, we can conclude that the list is not monotonic. If we only see one type of relationship (either all increases or all decreases), then the list is monotonic.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function is_Monotonic(array):
       if the array is empty or has one element:
           return True
       
       initialize a variable to track if we have seen an increase
       initialize a variable to track if we have seen a decrease
       
       for each index from 1 to the length of the array - 1:
           if the current element is greater than the previous element:
               set the increase variable to True
           else if the current element is less than the previous element:
               set the decrease variable to True
           
           if both increase and decrease are True:
               return False
       
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def is_Monotonic(array):
    # Check if the array is empty or has one element
    if len(array) <= 1:
        return True
