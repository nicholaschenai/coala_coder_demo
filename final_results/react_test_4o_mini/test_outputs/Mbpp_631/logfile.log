INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/631 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to replace whitespaces with an underscore and vice versa in a given string.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/631 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and replaces all spaces in the string with underscores ('_') and all underscores with spaces (' '). 

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the input string. For each character, we will check if it is a space or an underscore. If it is a space, we will replace it with an underscore, and if it is an underscore, we will replace it with a space. All other characters will remain unchanged. Finally, we will combine the modified characters back into a single string and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function replace_spaces(input_string):
       create an empty list to hold the modified characters
       for each character in input_string:
           if character is a space:
               append '_' to the list
           else if character is an underscore:
               append ' ' to the list
           else:
               append the character to the list
       join the list into a single string
       return the new string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def replace_spaces(input_string: str) -> str:
    # Create an empty list to hold the modified characters
    modified_chars = []
    
    # Iterate through each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # If the character is a space, replace it with an underscore
        if char == ' ':
            modified_chars.append('_')
        # If the character is an underscore, replace it with a space
        elif char == '_':
            modified_chars.append(' ')
        # Otherwise, keep the character unchanged
        else:
            modified_chars.append(char)
    
    # Join the list of modified characters into a single string
