For each character, we will check if it is a space or an underscore. If it is a space, we will replace it with an underscore, and if it is an underscore, we will replace it with a space. All other characters will remain unchanged. Finally, we will combine the modified characters back into a single string and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function replace_spaces(input_string):\n       create an empty list to hold the modified characters\n       for each character in input_string:\n           if character is a space:\n               append '_' to the list\n           else if character is an underscore:\n               append ' ' to the list\n           else:\n               append the character to the list\n       join the list into a single string\n       return the new string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef replace_spaces(input_string: str) -> str:\n    # Create an empty list to hold the modified characters\n    modified_chars = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the input string\n    for char in input_string:\n        # If the character is a space, replace it with an underscore\n        if char == ' ':\n            modified_chars.append('_')\n        # If the character is an underscore, replace it with a space\n        elif char == '_':\n            modified_chars.append(' ')\n        # Otherwise, keep the character unchanged\n        else:\n            modified_chars.append(char)\n    \n    # Join the list of modified characters into a single string\n    return ''.join(modified_chars)\n```"
