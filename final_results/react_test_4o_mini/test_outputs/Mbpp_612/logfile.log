You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/612 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists, where each inner list contains exactly two elements. The function should return a new list containing two lists: the first list should have all the first elements from the inner lists, and the second list should have all the second elements from the inner lists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each sublist in the input list. For each sublist, we will extract the first element and the second element. We will store the first elements in one list and the second elements in another list. Finally, we will return a list containing these two lists.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function merge(input_list):
       create an empty list first_elements
       create an empty list second_elements
       for each sublist in input_list:
           append the first element of sublist to first_elements
           append the second element of sublist to second_elements
       return a list containing first_elements and second_elements
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def merge(input_list):
    # Create an empty list to hold the first elements
    first_elements = []
    # Create an empty list to hold the second elements
    second_elements = []
    
    # Iterate through each sublist in the input list
    for sublist in input_list:
        # Append the first element of the sublist to first_elements
        first_elements.append(sublist[0])
        # Append the second element of the sublist to second_elements
        second_elements.append(sublist[1])
    
    # Return a list containing both lists
    return [first_elements, second_elements]
