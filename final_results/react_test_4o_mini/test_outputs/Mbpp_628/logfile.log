You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to replace all spaces in the given string with '%20'.
assert replace_spaces("My Name is Dawood") == 'My%20Name%20is%20Dawood'

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/628 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and replaces every space in that string with the substring '%20'.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the input string. Whenever we encounter a space, we will append '%20' to a new result string. If the character is not a space, we will simply append the character itself. Finally, we will return the new string that has all spaces replaced.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function replace_spaces(input_string):
       initialize an empty result string
       for each character in input_string:
           if character is a space:
               append '%20' to result string
           else:
               append character to result string
       return result string
   ```

            # Otherwise, append the character itself
