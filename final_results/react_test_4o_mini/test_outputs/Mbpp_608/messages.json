The Bell numbers are a sequence of numbers that represent the number of ways to partition a set. For example, the second Bell number is 2, which means there are two ways to partition a set of two elements.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the nth Bell number, we can use a recursive relationship. The Bell numbers can be computed using a triangular array where each Bell number is derived from the previous Bell numbers. Specifically, the Bell number for n can be calculated using the Bell numbers for n-1 and the values from the previous row of the triangle.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function bell_Number(n):\n       if n == 0:\n           return 1\n       create a 2D list (triangle) of size (n+1) x (n+1)\n       triangle[0][0] = 1\n       for i from 1 to n:\n           triangle[i][0] = triangle[i-1][i-1] (first element of each row)\n           for j from 1 to i:\n               triangle[i][j] = triangle[i-1][j-1] + triangle[i][j-1] (fill the triangle)\n       return the last element of the nth row (triangle[n][0])\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef bell_Number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Base case: the 0th Bell number is 1\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Create a 2D list (triangle) to store Bell numbers\n    triangle = [[0 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    \n    # The first Bell number is 1\n    triangle[0][0] = 1\n    \n    # Fill the triangle using the Bell number properties\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # The first element of each row is the last element of the previous row\n        triangle[i][0] = triangle[i - 1][i - 1]\n        \n        # Fill the rest of the row\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            triangle[i][j] = triangle[i - 1][j - 1] + triangle[i][j - 1]\n    \n    # The nth Bell number is the first element of the nth row\n    return triangle[n][0]\n```"
