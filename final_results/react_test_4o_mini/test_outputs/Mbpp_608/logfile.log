You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/608 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the nth Bell number. The Bell numbers are a sequence of numbers that represent the number of ways to partition a set. For example, the second Bell number is 2, which means there are two ways to partition a set of two elements.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the nth Bell number, we can use a recursive relationship. The Bell numbers can be computed using a triangular array where each Bell number is derived from the previous Bell numbers. Specifically, the Bell number for n can be calculated using the Bell numbers for n-1 and the values from the previous row of the triangle.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function bell_Number(n):
       if n == 0:
           return 1
       create a 2D list (triangle) of size (n+1) x (n+1)
       triangle[0][0] = 1
       for i from 1 to n:
           triangle[i][0] = triangle[i-1][i-1] (first element of each row)
           for j from 1 to i:
               triangle[i][j] = triangle[i-1][j-1] + triangle[i][j-1] (fill the triangle)
       return the last element of the nth row (triangle[n][0])
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def bell_Number(n: int) -> int:
    # Base case: the 0th Bell number is 1
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    
    # Create a 2D list (triangle) to store Bell numbers
    triangle = [[0 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]
