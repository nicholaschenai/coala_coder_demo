The lateral surface area refers to the area of the sides of the cube, excluding the top and bottom faces.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the lateral surface area of a cube, we can use the formula: \n   - Lateral Surface Area = 4 * (side length)\u00b2\n   This is because a cube has four vertical sides, and each side has an area equal to the square of the side length.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION lateralsurface_cube(side_length):\n       IF side_length is less than or equal to 0:\n           RETURN 0\n       lateral_surface_area = 4 * (side_length * side_length)\n       RETURN lateral_surface_area\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the lateral surface area of a cube\ndef lateralsurface_cube(side_length):\n    # Check if the side length is valid (greater than 0)\n    if side_length <= 0:\n        return 0  # Return 0 for non-positive side lengths\n    # Calculate the lateral surface area using the formula\n    lateral_surface_area = 4 * (side_length * side_length)\n    return lateral_surface_area  # Return the calculated area\n```"
