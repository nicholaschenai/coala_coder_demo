You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/266 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cube based on the length of its sides. The lateral surface area refers to the area of the sides of the cube, excluding the top and bottom faces.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the lateral surface area of a cube, we can use the formula: 
   - Lateral Surface Area = 4 * (side length)Â²
   This is because a cube has four vertical sides, and each side has an area equal to the square of the side length.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION lateralsurface_cube(side_length):
       IF side_length is less than or equal to 0:
           RETURN 0
       lateral_surface_area = 4 * (side_length * side_length)
       RETURN lateral_surface_area
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to calculate the lateral surface area of a cube
def lateralsurface_cube(side_length):
    # Check if the side length is valid (greater than 0)
    if side_length <= 0:
        return 0  # Return 0 for non-positive side lengths
    # Calculate the lateral surface area using the formula
    lateral_surface_area = 4 * (side_length * side_length)
    return lateral_surface_area  # Return the calculated area
```
