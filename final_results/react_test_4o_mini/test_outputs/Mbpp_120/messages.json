The function should calculate the product of the two numbers in each tuple, find the absolute value of these products, and return the maximum absolute product found among all the tuples.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum absolute product found.\n   - Loop through each tuple in the list.\n   - For each tuple, calculate the product of the two numbers.\n   - Take the absolute value of this product.\n   - If this absolute value is greater than the current maximum, update the maximum.\n   - After checking all tuples, return the maximum absolute product.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function max_product_tuple(tuples):\n       max_product = 0\n       for each tuple in tuples:\n           product = tuple[0] * tuple[1]\n           abs_product = absolute(product)\n           if abs_product > max_product:\n               max_product = abs_product\n       return max_product\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef max_product_tuple(tuples):\n    # Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum absolute product\n    max_product = 0\n    \n    # Loop through each tuple in the list\n    for tup in tuples:\n        # Calculate the product of the two numbers in the tuple\n        product = tup[0] * tup[1]\n        \n        # Take the absolute value of the product\n        abs_product = abs(product)\n        \n        # If the absolute product is greater than the current maximum, update it\n        if abs_product > max_product:\n            max_product = abs_product\n            \n    # Return the maximum absolute product found\n    return max_product\n```"
