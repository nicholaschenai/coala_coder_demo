You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find the maximum absolute product between numbers in pairs of tuples within a given list.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/120 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two numbers. The function should calculate the product of the two numbers in each tuple, find the absolute value of these products, and return the maximum absolute product found among all the tuples.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum absolute product found.
   - Loop through each tuple in the list.
   - For each tuple, calculate the product of the two numbers.
   - Take the absolute value of this product.
   - If this absolute value is greater than the current maximum, update the maximum.
   - After checking all tuples, return the maximum absolute product.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_product_tuple(tuples):
       max_product = 0
       for each tuple in tuples:
           product = tuple[0] * tuple[1]
           abs_product = absolute(product)
           if abs_product > max_product:
               max_product = abs_product
       return max_product
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def max_product_tuple(tuples):
    # Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum absolute product
