    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that checks if a given integer can be expressed as the difference between the squares of two integers. For example, the number 5 can be represented as \\(3^2 - 2^2\\) (which is 9 - 4).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To determine if a number \\(n\\) can be expressed as the difference of two squares, we can use the mathematical property that a number can be expressed as the difference of two squares if and only if it is not of the form \\(4k + 2\\) for some integer \\(k\\). This means that if \\(n\\) modulo 4 equals 2, then it cannot be expressed as the difference of two squares. Otherwise, it can.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `dif_Square(n)`.\n   - Check if \\(n \\mod 4\\) equals 2.\n     - If it does, return `False`.\n     - Otherwise, return `True`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef dif_Square(n):\n    # Check if n modulo 4 equals 2\n    if n % 4 == 2:\n        # If it does, it cannot be expressed as the difference of two squares\n        return False\n    # Otherwise, it can be expressed as the difference of two squares\n    return True\n```",
