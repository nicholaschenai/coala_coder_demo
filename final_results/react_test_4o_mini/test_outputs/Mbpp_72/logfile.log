You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/72 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a given integer can be expressed as the difference between the squares of two integers. For example, the number 5 can be represented as \(3^2 - 2^2\) (which is 9 - 4).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To determine if a number \(n\) can be expressed as the difference of two squares, we can use the mathematical property that a number can be expressed as the difference of two squares if and only if it is not of the form \(4k + 2\) for some integer \(k\). This means that if \(n\) modulo 4 equals 2, then it cannot be expressed as the difference of two squares. Otherwise, it can.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `dif_Square(n)`.
   - Check if \(n \mod 4\) equals 2.
     - If it does, return `False`.
     - Otherwise, return `True`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def dif_Square(n):
    # Check if n modulo 4 equals 2
    if n % 4 == 2:
        # If it does, it cannot be expressed as the difference of two squares
        return False
    # Otherwise, it can be expressed as the difference of two squares
    return True
