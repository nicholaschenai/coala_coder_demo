You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/630 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a coordinate represented as a tuple (x, y) and returns a list of all adjacent coordinates. Adjacent coordinates are those that differ by at most 1 in either the x or y direction.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the adjacent coordinates, we can iterate through a range of values around the given coordinate. Specifically, we can check the coordinates that are one unit away in all directions (left, right, up, down, and the diagonals). We will collect these coordinates in a list and return them.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function `get_coordinates` that takes a tuple `coord`.
   - Initialize an empty list to hold the adjacent coordinates.
   - Use nested loops to iterate through the range of -1 to 1 for both x and y directions.
   - For each combination of x and y offsets, calculate the new coordinates.
   - Append the new coordinates to the list.
   - Return the list of adjacent coordinates.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def get_coordinates(coord):
    # Initialize an empty list to hold the adjacent coordinates
    adjacent_coords = []
    
    # Iterate through the range of -1 to 1 for both x and y directions
    for dx in range(-1, 2):  # dx will be -1, 0, 1
        for dy in range(-1, 2):  # dy will be -1, 0, 1
            # Calculate the new coordinates
            new_x = coord[0] + dx
            new_y = coord[1] + dy
            
            # Append the new coordinates to the list
            adjacent_coords.append([new_x, new_y])
