Adjacent coordinates are those that differ by at most 1 in either the x or y direction.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the adjacent coordinates, we can iterate through a range of values around the given coordinate. Specifically, we can check the coordinates that are one unit away in all directions (left, right, up, down, and the diagonals). We will collect these coordinates in a list and return them.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function `get_coordinates` that takes a tuple `coord`.\n   - Initialize an empty list to hold the adjacent coordinates.\n   - Use nested loops to iterate through the range of -1 to 1 for both x and y directions.\n   - For each combination of x and y offsets, calculate the new coordinates.\n   - Append the new coordinates to the list.\n   - Return the list of adjacent coordinates.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef get_coordinates(coord):\n    # Initialize an empty list to hold the adjacent coordinates\n    adjacent_coords = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the range of -1 to 1 for both x and y directions\n    for dx in range(-1, 2):  # dx will be -1, 0, 1\n        for dy in range(-1, 2):  # dy will be -1, 0, 1\n            # Calculate the new coordinates\n            new_x = coord[0] + dx\n            new_y = coord[1] + dy\n            \n            # Append the new coordinates to the list\n            adjacent_coords.append([new_x, new_y])\n    \n    # Return the list of adjacent coordinates\n    return adjacent_coords\n```"
