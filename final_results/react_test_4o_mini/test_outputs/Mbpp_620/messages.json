We will sort the list of numbers first. Then, we will create a list to keep track of the size of the largest subset that can be formed with each number as the largest element. For each number, we will check all previous numbers to see if they can divide the current number. If they can, we will update the size of the subset for the current number based on the size of the subset of the previous number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function largest_subset(numbers):\n       sort the numbers\n       create a list dp of the same length as numbers initialized to 1\n       for i from 1 to length of numbers:\n           for j from 0 to i-1:\n               if numbers[i] % numbers[j] == 0:\n                   dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n       return max(dp)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef largest_subset(numbers):\n    # Step 1: Sort the numbers to ensure we can check divisibility in order\n    numbers.sort()\n    \n    # Step 2: Create a list to store the size of the largest subset ending with each number\n    dp = [1] * len(numbers)\n    \n    # Step 3: Iterate through each number to find the largest subset\n    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):\n        for j in range(i):\n            # Step 4: Check if the current number is divisible by the previous number\n            if numbers[i] % numbers[j] == 0:\n                # Step 5: Update the dp array with the maximum size of the subset\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n    \n    # Step 6: Return the maximum size found in the dp array\n    return max(dp)\n```"
