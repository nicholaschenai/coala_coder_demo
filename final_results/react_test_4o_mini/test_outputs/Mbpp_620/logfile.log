You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/620 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and finds the largest subset of those numbers such that every pair of numbers in that subset can divide each other without leaving a remainder.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will sort the list of numbers first. Then, we will create a list to keep track of the size of the largest subset that can be formed with each number as the largest element. For each number, we will check all previous numbers to see if they can divide the current number. If they can, we will update the size of the subset for the current number based on the size of the subset of the previous number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function largest_subset(numbers):
       sort the numbers
       create a list dp of the same length as numbers initialized to 1
       for i from 1 to length of numbers:
           for j from 0 to i-1:
               if numbers[i] % numbers[j] == 0:
                   dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
       return max(dp)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def largest_subset(numbers):
    # Step 1: Sort the numbers to ensure we can check divisibility in order
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Step 2: Create a list to store the size of the largest subset ending with each number
    dp = [1] * len(numbers)
    
    # Step 3: Iterate through each number to find the largest subset
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i):
            # Step 4: Check if the current number is divisible by the previous number
            if numbers[i] % numbers[j] == 0:
                # Step 5: Update the dp array with the maximum size of the subset
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    
    # Step 6: Return the maximum size found in the dp array
    return max(dp)
