The function should take a list of integers as input and return a new list that is sorted in ascending order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   Shell sort is an optimization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart. The algorithm starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other, then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared. The process continues until the gap is reduced to one, at which point the list is sorted using a simple insertion sort.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function shell_sort(arr):\n       n = length of arr\n       gap = n // 2  // Start with a big gap, then reduce the gap\n       while gap > 0:\n           for i from gap to n-1:\n               temp = arr[i]\n               j = i\n               // Shift earlier gap-sorted elements up until the correct location for arr[i] is found\n               while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:\n                   arr[j] = arr[j - gap]\n                   j -= gap\n               arr[j] = temp\n           gap //= 2  // Reduce the gap for the next element\n       return arr\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef shell_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)  # Get the length of the array\n    gap = n // 2  # Start with a big gap, then reduce the gap\n    while gap > 0:  # Continue until the gap is reduced to zero\n        for i in range(gap, n):  # Start from the gap to the end of the array\n            temp = arr[i]  # Store the current element\n            j = i  # Initialize j to the current index\n            # Shift earlier gap-sorted elements up until the correct location for arr[i] is found\n            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:\n                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]  # Move the element at j-gap to position j\n                j -= gap  # Move j back by the gap\n            arr[j] = temp  # Place the stored element in its correct position\n        gap //= 2  # Reduce the gap for the next iteration\n    return arr  # Return the sorted array\n```"
