You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/791 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a tuple as input and removes any nested tuples from it. The output should be a new tuple that contains only the non-tuple elements from the original tuple.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each element of the input tuple. For each element, we will check if it is a tuple. If it is not a tuple, we will keep it; if it is a tuple, we will skip it. Finally, we will return a new tuple that contains only the non-tuple elements.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function remove_nested(input_tuple):
       create an empty list to hold non-tuple elements
       for each element in input_tuple:
           if element is not a tuple:
               add element to the list
       convert the list to a tuple
       return the new tuple
   ```

def remove_nested(input_tuple):
    # Create an empty list to hold non-tuple elements

        if not isinstance(element, tuple):
            # Add the non-tuple element to the list
            non_tuples.append(element)
    
    # Convert the list of non-tuple elements back to a tuple
