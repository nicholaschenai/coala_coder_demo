The output should be a new tuple that contains only the non-tuple elements from the original tuple.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each element of the input tuple.

Finally, we will return a new tuple that contains only the non-tuple elements.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function remove_nested(input_tuple):\n       create an empty list to hold non-tuple elements\n       for each element in input_tuple:\n           if element is not a tuple:\n               add element to the list\n       convert the list to a tuple\n       return the new tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef remove_nested(input_tuple):\n    # Create an empty list to hold non-tuple elements\n    non_tuples = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the input tuple\n    for element in input_tuple:\n        # Check if the element is not a tuple\n        if not isinstance(element, tuple):\n            # Add the non-tuple element to the list\n            non_tuples.append(element)\n    \n    # Convert the list of non-tuple elements back to a tuple\n    return tuple(non_tuples)\n```"
