You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to find the largest number that can be formed with the given list of digits.
assert find_Max_Num([1,2,3]) == 321

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/57 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of single-digit integers and returns the largest possible number that can be formed by arranging those digits.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the largest number, we can convert each digit to a string, sort the strings in descending order, and then concatenate them to form the final number. Finally, we will convert the concatenated string back to an integer to return the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function `find_Max_Num` that takes a list of digits as input.
   - Convert each digit in the list to a string.
   - Sort the list of strings in descending order.
   - Join the sorted strings into a single string.
   - Convert the resulting string back to an integer.
   - Return the integer.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def find_Max_Num(digits):
    # Convert each digit to a string
    str_digits = [str(digit) for digit in digits]
    
    # Sort the string digits in descending order
    str_digits.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Join the sorted strings into a single string
    largest_num_str = ''.join(str_digits)
    
    # Convert the resulting string back to an integer
    largest_num = int(largest_num_str)
    
    # Return the largest number formed
    return largest_num
