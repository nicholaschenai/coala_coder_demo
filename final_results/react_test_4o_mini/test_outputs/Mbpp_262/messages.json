The function should split the list into two parts: the first part should contain the first L elements of the list, and the second part should contain the remaining elements. The function should return these two parts as a tuple.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Take the input list and the integer L.\n   - Use slicing to create the first part of the list, which will include the first L elements.\n   - The second part will be the remainder of the list, starting from the L-th index to the end.\n   - Finally, we will return both parts as a tuple.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function split_two_parts(list, L):\n       first_part = list[0:L]  // Get the first L elements\n       second_part = list[L:]   // Get the elements from index L to the end\n       return (first_part, second_part)  // Return the two parts as a tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef split_two_parts(lst, L):\n    # Get the first part of the list containing the first L elements\n    first_part = lst[0:L]\n    # Get the second part of the list containing the elements from index L to the end\n    second_part = lst[L:]\n    # Return both parts as a tuple\n    return (first_part, second_part)\n```"
