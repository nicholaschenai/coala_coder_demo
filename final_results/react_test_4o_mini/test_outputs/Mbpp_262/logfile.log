You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/262 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list and an integer L. The function should split the list into two parts: the first part should contain the first L elements of the list, and the second part should contain the remaining elements. The function should return these two parts as a tuple.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Take the input list and the integer L.
   - Use slicing to create the first part of the list, which will include the first L elements.
   - The second part will be the remainder of the list, starting from the L-th index to the end.
   - Finally, we will return both parts as a tuple.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function split_two_parts(list, L):
       first_part = list[0:L]  // Get the first L elements
       second_part = list[L:]   // Get the elements from index L to the end
       return (first_part, second_part)  // Return the two parts as a tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def split_two_parts(lst, L):
    # Get the first part of the list containing the first L elements
    first_part = lst[0:L]
    # Get the second part of the list containing the elements from index L to the end
    second_part = lst[L:]
    # Return both parts as a tuple
    return (first_part, second_part)
```
