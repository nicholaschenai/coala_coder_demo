If the number is even, the function should return `True`, and if it is odd, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if a number is even, we can use the modulus operator `%`. If a number divided by 2 has a remainder of 0, then it is even. Otherwise, it is odd.
