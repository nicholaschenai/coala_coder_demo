INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/600 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/600 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given number is even. If the number is even, the function should return `True`, and if it is odd, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if a number is even, we can use the modulus operator `%`. If a number divided by 2 has a remainder of 0, then it is even. Otherwise, it is odd. We will implement a function that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean value based on this check.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Function is_Even(number):
       If number % 2 == 0:
           Return True
       Else:
           Return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:

# Define a function to check if a number is even
def is_Even(number):
    # Check if the number is divisible by 2
    if number % 2 == 0:
        # If true, return True (the number is even)
        return True
    else:
        # If false, return False (the number is odd)
        return False
