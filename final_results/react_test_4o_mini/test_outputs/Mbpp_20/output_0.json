    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that determines if a given number is a \"woodball\" number. A woodball number is defined as a number that can be expressed as the sum of consecutive integers starting from 1.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To check if a number is a woodball number, we can find the sum of consecutive integers starting from 1 and see if we can reach the given number. The sum of the first `n` integers is given by the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`. We will keep calculating this sum for increasing values of `n` until the sum is equal to or greater than the given number. If we find a match, the number is a woodball number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function is_woodall(number):\n       initialize sum to 0\n       initialize n to 1\n       while sum is less than number:\n           sum = sum + n\n           if sum equals number:\n               return True\n           increment n by 1\n       return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef is_woodall(number):\n    # Initialize the sum of consecutive integers\n    sum = 0\n    # Start with the first integer\n    n = 1\n    # Continue until the sum is less than the given number\n    while sum < number:\n        # Add the current integer to the sum\n        sum += n\n        # Check if the current sum equals the given number\n        if sum == number:\n            return True\n        # Move to the next integer\n        n += 1\n    # If we exit the loop, the number is not a woodball number\n    return False\n```",
