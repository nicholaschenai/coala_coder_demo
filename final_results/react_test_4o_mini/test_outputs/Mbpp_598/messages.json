An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if a number is an Armstrong number, we will:\n   - Convert the number to a string to easily access each digit.\n   - Count the number of digits in the number.\n   - For each digit, raise it to the power of the total number of digits and sum these values.\n   - Finally, compare the sum to the original number. If they are equal, the number is an Armstrong number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function armstrong_number(n):\n       convert n to string to get digits\n       count the number of digits (d)\n       initialize sum to 0\n       for each digit in digits:\n           convert digit back to integer\n           raise digit to the power of d and add to sum\n       if sum equals n:\n           return True\n       else:\n           return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef armstrong_number(n):\n    # Convert the number to a string to access each digit\n    digits = str(n)\n    # Count the number of digits\n    num_digits = len(digits)\n    # Initialize a variable to hold the sum of the powers\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each digit\n    for digit in digits:\n        # Convert the digit back to an integer and raise it to the power of num_digits\n        total_sum += int(digit) ** num_digits\n    \n    # Check if the total sum is equal to the original number\n    return total_sum == n\n```"
