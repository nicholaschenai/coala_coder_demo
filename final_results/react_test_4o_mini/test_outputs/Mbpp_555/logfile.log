You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to find the difference between the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the first n natural numbers.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/555 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the difference between two values: the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula \( \text{Sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - Calculate the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula \( \text{Sum of cubes} = \left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right)^2 \).
   - Finally, we will find the difference between the sum of cubes and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function difference(n):
       sum_n = (n * (n + 1)) / 2
       sum_cubes = sum_n^2
       return sum_cubes - sum_n
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def difference(n):
    # Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers
    sum_n = (n * (n + 1)) // 2
    # Calculate the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers
    sum_cubes = sum_n * sum_n
    # Return the difference between the sum of cubes and the sum of the first n natural numbers
    return sum_cubes - sum_n
```
