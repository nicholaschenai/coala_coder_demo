    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the difference between two values: the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula \\( \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\).\n   - Calculate the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula \\( \\text{Sum of cubes} = \\left(\\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\\right)^2 \\).\n   - Finally, we will find the difference between the sum of cubes and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function difference(n):\n       sum_n = (n * (n + 1)) / 2\n       sum_cubes = sum_n^2\n       return sum_cubes - sum_n\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef difference(n):\n    # Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers\n    sum_n = (n * (n + 1)) // 2\n    # Calculate the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers\n    sum_cubes = sum_n * sum_n\n    # Return the difference between the sum of cubes and the sum of the first n natural numbers\n    return sum_cubes - sum_n\n```",
