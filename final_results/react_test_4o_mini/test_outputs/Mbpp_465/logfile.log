INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/465 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to drop empty items from a given dictionary.
assert drop_empty({'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green', 'c3':None})=={'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green'}

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/465 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a dictionary as input and removes any key-value pairs where the value is empty. In this context, an empty value is defined as `None`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through the dictionary and check each value. If a value is not `None`, we will keep the key-value pair in a new dictionary. Finally, we will return this new dictionary that contains only the non-empty items.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function drop_empty(input_dict):
       create an empty dictionary called result
       for each key-value pair in input_dict:
           if value is not None:
               add key-value pair to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def drop_empty(input_dict):
    # Create an empty dictionary to store non-empty items
    result = {}
    
    # Iterate through each key-value pair in the input dictionary
    for key, value in input_dict.items():
        # Check if the value is not None
        if value is not None:
            # Add the key-value pair to the result dictionary
            result[key] = value
            
    # Return the dictionary containing only non-empty items
