INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/116 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/116 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a tuple of positive integers and combines them into a single integer. For example, if the input is (1, 2, 3), the output should be 123.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can convert each integer in the tuple to a string, concatenate these strings together, and then convert the resulting string back into an integer. This will give us the desired single integer output.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function named `tuple_to_int` that takes a tuple as an argument.
   - Initialize an empty string to hold the concatenated result.
   - Loop through each integer in the tuple:
     - Convert the integer to a string and append it to the result string.
   - Convert the final concatenated string back to an integer.
   - Return the resulting integer.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def tuple_to_int(tup):
    # Initialize an empty string to hold the concatenated result
    result_str = ""
    
    # Loop through each integer in the tuple
    for num in tup:
        # Convert the integer to a string and append it to the result string
        result_str += str(num)
    
    # Convert the final concatenated string back to an integer
    result_int = int(result_str)
    
    # Return the resulting integer
    return result_int
