    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples and an integer `k`. The function should return a new list containing only those tuples where every element in the tuple is divisible by `k`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each tuple in the list. For each tuple, we will check if all its elements are divisible by `k`. If they are, we will add that tuple to a new list. Finally, we will return the new list containing only the tuples that meet the criteria.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_tuples(tuples_list, k):\n       create an empty list called result\n       for each tuple in tuples_list:\n           set a flag called all_divisible to True\n           for each element in the tuple:\n               if element is not divisible by k:\n                   set all_divisible to False\n                   break out of the loop\n           if all_divisible is True:\n               add the tuple to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_tuples(tuples_list, k):\n    # Create an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the provided list\n    for tup in tuples_list:\n        # Assume all elements are divisible by k\n        all_divisible = True\n        \n        # Check each element in the tuple\n        for element in tup:\n            # If any element is not divisible by k, set the flag to False\n            if element % k != 0:\n                all_divisible = False\n                break  # No need to check further elements\n        \n        # If all elements were divisible, add the tuple to the result list\n        if all_divisible:\n            result.append(tup)\n    \n    # Return the list of tuples that meet the criteria\n    return result\n```",
