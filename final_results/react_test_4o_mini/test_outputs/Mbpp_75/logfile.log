You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find tuples which have all elements divisible by k from the given list of tuples.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/75 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples and an integer `k`. The function should return a new list containing only those tuples where every element in the tuple is divisible by `k`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each tuple in the list. For each tuple, we will check if all its elements are divisible by `k`. If they are, we will add that tuple to a new list. Finally, we will return the new list containing only the tuples that meet the criteria.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_tuples(tuples_list, k):
       create an empty list called result
       for each tuple in tuples_list:
           set a flag called all_divisible to True
           for each element in the tuple:
               if element is not divisible by k:
                   set all_divisible to False
                   break out of the loop
           if all_divisible is True:
               add the tuple to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def find_tuples(tuples_list, k):
    # Create an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the provided list
    for tup in tuples_list:

        all_divisible = True
        
        # Check each element in the tuple
        for element in tup:
            # If any element is not divisible by k, set the flag to False
            if element % k != 0:
                all_divisible = False
                break  # No need to check further elements
        
        # If all elements were divisible, add the tuple to the result list
        if all_divisible:
            result.append(tup)
