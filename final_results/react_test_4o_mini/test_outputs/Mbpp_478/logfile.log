You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/478 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and removes all lowercase substrings from it. A lowercase substring is defined as any sequence of characters in the string that are all lowercase letters.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string and check each character. If we encounter a lowercase letter, we will skip it and not include it in the final result. We will build a new string that only contains the uppercase letters and any other characters that are not lowercase.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Initialize an empty result string.
   - Loop through each character in the input string.
   - If the character is not a lowercase letter (i.e., it is uppercase or not a letter), append it to the result string.
   - Return the result string after the loop ends.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def remove_lowercase(s: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty result string
    result = ""
    
    # Loop through each character in the input string
    for char in s:
        # Check if the character is not a lowercase letter
        if not char.islower():
            # Append the character to the result string
            result += char
            
    # Return the result string
    return result
