A lowercase substring is defined as any sequence of characters in the string that are all lowercase letters.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string and check each character. If we encounter a lowercase letter, we will skip it and not include it in the final result. We will build a new string that only contains the uppercase letters and any other characters that are not lowercase.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Initialize an empty result string.\n   - Loop through each character in the input string.\n   - If the character is not a lowercase letter (i.e., it is uppercase or not a letter), append it to the result string.\n   - Return the result string after the loop ends.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef remove_lowercase(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty result string\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Loop through each character in the input string\n    for char in s:\n        # Check if the character is not a lowercase letter\n        if not char.islower():\n            # Append the character to the result string\n            result += char\n            \n    # Return the result string\n    return result\n```"
