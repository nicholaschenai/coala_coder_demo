    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that checks if two lists follow the same pattern. The first list contains colors, and the second list contains letters. A pattern is considered the same if the same colors map to the same letters in both lists.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To determine if the two lists follow the same pattern, we can use a dictionary to map each unique color to its corresponding letter. We will iterate through both lists simultaneously, checking if the current color has been seen before and if it maps to the expected letter. If we find any discrepancies, we return `False`. If we finish checking all elements without issues, we return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function is_samepatterns(patterns, values):\n       create an empty dictionary for mapping\n       for each index in the range of the length of patterns:\n           get the current color and letter\n           if the color is not in the dictionary:\n               if the letter is already mapped to another color:\n                   return False\n               map the color to the letter in the dictionary\n           else:\n               if the mapped letter does not match the current letter:\n                   return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef is_samepatterns(patterns, values):\n    # Create a dictionary to map colors to letters\n    color_to_letter = {}\n    # Create a set to track letters that have already been assigned\n    letter_assigned = set()\n    \n    # Iterate through both lists simultaneously\n    for i in range(len(patterns)):\n        color = patterns[i]\n        letter = values[i]\n        \n        # If the color is not in the mapping\n        if color not in color_to_letter:\n            # If the letter is already assigned to another color, return False\n            if letter in letter_assigned:\n                return False\n            # Map the color to the letter and mark the letter as assigned\n            color_to_letter[color] = letter\n            letter_assigned.add(letter)\n        else:\n            # If the color is already mapped, check if it matches the current letter\n            if color_to_letter[color] != letter:\n                return False\n    \n    # If all checks pass, return True\n    return True\n```",
