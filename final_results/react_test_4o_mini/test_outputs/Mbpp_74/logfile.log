You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/74 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if two lists follow the same pattern. The first list contains colors, and the second list contains letters. A pattern is considered the same if the same colors map to the same letters in both lists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To determine if the two lists follow the same pattern, we can use a dictionary to map each unique color to its corresponding letter. We will iterate through both lists simultaneously, checking if the current color has been seen before and if it maps to the expected letter. If we find any discrepancies, we return `False`. If we finish checking all elements without issues, we return `True`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function is_samepatterns(patterns, values):
       create an empty dictionary for mapping
       for each index in the range of the length of patterns:
           get the current color and letter
           if the color is not in the dictionary:
               if the letter is already mapped to another color:
                   return False
               map the color to the letter in the dictionary
           else:
               if the mapped letter does not match the current letter:
                   return False
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def is_samepatterns(patterns, values):
    # Create a dictionary to map colors to letters
    color_to_letter = {}
    # Create a set to track letters that have already been assigned
    letter_assigned = set()
