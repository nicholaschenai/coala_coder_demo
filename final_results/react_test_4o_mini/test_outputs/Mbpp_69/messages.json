The function should return `True` if the sublist is found in the main list and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if the sublist exists in the main list, we can iterate through the main list and check for segments of it that match the sublist. We will compare slices of the main list with the sublist. If we find a match, we return `True`. If we finish checking all possible segments without finding a match, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function is_sublist(main_list, sub_list):\n       if sub_list is empty:\n           return True\n       if main_list is empty:\n           return False\n       for each index in main_list:\n           if the slice of main_list from index to index + length of sub_list matches sub_list:\n               return True\n       return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef is_sublist(main_list, sub_list):\n    # If the sublist is empty, it is considered to be present in any list\n    if not sub_list:\n        return True\n    # If the main list is empty and sublist is not, sublist cannot be present\n    if not main_list:\n        return False\n    # Get the lengths of the main list and sublist\n    main_length = len(main_list)\n    sub_length = len(sub_list)\n    \n    # Iterate through the main list\n    for i in range(main_length - sub_length + 1):\n        # Check if the slice of main_list matches the sub_list\n        if main_list[i:i + sub_length] == sub_list:\n            return True\n    # If no match was found, return False\n    return False\n```"
