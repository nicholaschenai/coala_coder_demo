INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/69 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/69 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given list (sublist) is present within another list (main list). The function should return `True` if the sublist is found in the main list and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if the sublist exists in the main list, we can iterate through the main list and check for segments of it that match the sublist. We will compare slices of the main list with the sublist. If we find a match, we return `True`. If we finish checking all possible segments without finding a match, we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function is_sublist(main_list, sub_list):
       if sub_list is empty:
           return True
       if main_list is empty:
           return False
       for each index in main_list:
           if the slice of main_list from index to index + length of sub_list matches sub_list:
               return True
       return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:

def is_sublist(main_list, sub_list):

        if main_list[i:i + sub_length] == sub_list:
