    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that calculates the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence. The sequence is defined such that:\n   - The first number is 1.\n   - The second number is also 1.\n   - The third number is 2.\n   - For any number n greater than 3, the nth number is the sum of the numbers at the positions defined by the values of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th numbers in the sequence.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To find the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence, we can use a list to store the sequence values. We will initialize the first three values of the sequence. For each subsequent number, we will calculate its value based on the values of the previous two numbers in the sequence. This will continue until we reach the nth number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function sequence(n):\n       if n is 1 or 2:\n           return 1\n       if n is 3:\n           return 2\n       create a list 'seq' with first three values [0, 1, 1, 2]\n       for i from 4 to n:\n           next_value = seq[seq[i-1]] + seq[seq[i-2]]\n           append next_value to seq\n       return seq[n]\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef sequence(n):\n    # Handle base cases for n = 1, 2, and 3\n    if n == 1 or n == 2:\n        return 1\n    if n == 3:\n        return 2\n    \n    # Initialize the sequence list with the first three values\n    seq = [0, 1, 1, 2]\n    \n    # Calculate the sequence values from 4 to n\n    for i in range(4, n + 1):\n        # The next value is the sum of the values at the positions defined by seq[i-1] and seq[i-2]\n        next_value = seq[seq[i - 1]] + seq[seq[i - 2]]\n        seq.append(next_value)\n    \n    # Return the nth value in the sequence\n    return seq[n]\n```",
