You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/577 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that calculates the last digit of the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a number n (denoted as n!) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n. For example, the factorial of 4 (4!) is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, which equals 24. The last digit of 24 is 4.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the last digit of the factorial of a number, we can calculate the factorial by multiplying all integers from 1 to that number. After calculating the factorial, we can simply take the last digit by using the modulus operator with 10. This will give us the last digit of the resulting factorial.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function last_Digit_Factorial(n):
       if n is 0 or n is 1:
           return 1
       factorial = 1
       for i from 2 to n:
           factorial = factorial * i
       return factorial % 10
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
# Function to find the last digit of the factorial of a given number
def last_Digit_Factorial(n):
    # Handle the base case where n is 0 or 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize factorial variable
    factorial = 1
    
    # Calculate factorial by multiplying all integers from 2 to n
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        factorial *= i
    
    # Return the last digit of the factorial
    return factorial % 10
