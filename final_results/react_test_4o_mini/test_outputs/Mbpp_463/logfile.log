You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/463 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that takes an array of integers and finds the maximum product that can be obtained from a contiguous subarray within that array. The function should return this maximum product.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array while keeping track of the maximum product that can be obtained up to the current index. We will also need to consider negative numbers, as they can turn a small product into a large one when multiplied by another negative number. Therefore, we will maintain two variables: one for the maximum product and one for the minimum product (to handle negative values). At each step, we will update these variables based on the current number and the products calculated so far.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_subarray_product(arr):
       if arr is empty:
           return 0
       
       max_product = arr[0]
       min_product = arr[0]
       result = arr[0]
       
       for each number in arr starting from index 1:
           if number is negative:
               swap max_product and min_product
           
           max_product = max(number, max_product * number)
           min_product = min(number, min_product * number)
           
           result = max(result, max_product)
       
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def max_subarray_product(arr):
    # Check if the array is empty
    if not arr:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize max_product, min_product, and result with the first element
    max_product = arr[0]
