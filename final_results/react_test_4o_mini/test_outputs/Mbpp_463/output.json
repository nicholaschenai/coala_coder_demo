    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to write a function that takes an array of integers and finds the maximum product that can be obtained from a contiguous subarray within that array. The function should return this maximum product.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array while keeping track of the maximum product that can be obtained up to the current index. We will also need to consider negative numbers, as they can turn a small product into a large one when multiplied by another negative number. Therefore, we will maintain two variables: one for the maximum product and one for the minimum product (to handle negative values). At each step, we will update these variables based on the current number and the products calculated so far.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function max_subarray_product(arr):\n       if arr is empty:\n           return 0\n       \n       max_product = arr[0]\n       min_product = arr[0]\n       result = arr[0]\n       \n       for each number in arr starting from index 1:\n           if number is negative:\n               swap max_product and min_product\n           \n           max_product = max(number, max_product * number)\n           min_product = min(number, min_product * number)\n           \n           result = max(result, max_product)\n       \n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef max_subarray_product(arr):\n    # Check if the array is empty\n    if not arr:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Initialize max_product, min_product, and result with the first element\n    max_product = arr[0]\n    min_product = arr[0]\n    result = arr[0]\n    \n    # Iterate through the array starting from the second element\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        number = arr[i]\n        \n        # If the current number is negative, swap max_product and min_product\n        if number < 0:\n            max_product, min_product = min_product, max_product\n        \n        # Update max_product and min_product\n        max_product = max(number, max_product * number)\n        min_product = min(number, min_product * number)\n        \n        # Update the result with the maximum product found so far\n        result = max(result, max_product)\n    \n    return result\n```",
