    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a matrix (a list of lists) as input and sorts the rows of this matrix based on the sum of the elements in each row. The rows should be arranged in ascending order according to these sums.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Calculate the sum of each row in the matrix.\n   - Pair each row with its corresponding sum.\n   - Sort these pairs based on the sums.\n   - Extract the sorted rows from the sorted pairs to form the final sorted matrix.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function sort_matrix(matrix):\n       create a list of tuples where each tuple contains (sum of row, row)\n       sort the list of tuples based on the first element (sum of row)\n       create a new list to hold the sorted rows\n       for each tuple in the sorted list:\n           append the second element (the row) to the new list\n       return the new list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef sort_matrix(matrix):\n    # Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the sum of the row and the row itself\n    row_sums = [(sum(row), row) for row in matrix]\n    \n    # Sort the list of tuples based on the first element (the sum of the row)\n    row_sums.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n    \n    # Create a new list to hold the sorted rows\n    sorted_matrix = []\n    \n    # Extract the rows from the sorted list of tuples\n    for _, row in row_sums:\n        sorted_matrix.append(row)\n    \n    # Return the new list of sorted rows\n    return sorted_matrix\n```",
