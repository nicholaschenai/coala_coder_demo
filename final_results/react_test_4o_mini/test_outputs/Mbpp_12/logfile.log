You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/12 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a matrix (a list of lists) as input and sorts the rows of this matrix based on the sum of the elements in each row. The rows should be arranged in ascending order according to these sums.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Calculate the sum of each row in the matrix.
   - Pair each row with its corresponding sum.
   - Sort these pairs based on the sums.
   - Extract the sorted rows from the sorted pairs to form the final sorted matrix.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sort_matrix(matrix):
       create a list of tuples where each tuple contains (sum of row, row)
       sort the list of tuples based on the first element (sum of row)
       create a new list to hold the sorted rows
       for each tuple in the sorted list:
           append the second element (the row) to the new list
       return the new list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def sort_matrix(matrix):
    # Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the sum of the row and the row itself
    row_sums = [(sum(row), row) for row in matrix]
    
    # Sort the list of tuples based on the first element (the sum of the row)
    row_sums.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    # Create a new list to hold the sorted rows
    sorted_matrix = []
    
    # Extract the rows from the sorted list of tuples
    for _, row in row_sums:
        sorted_matrix.append(row)
    
    # Return the new list of sorted rows
    return sorted_matrix
