    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of the products of all possible sublists (or contiguous subarrays) of a given list of integers. For example, for the list [1, 2, 3], we need to find the sum of the products of all its sublists.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can generate all possible contiguous sublists of the input list. For each sublist, we will calculate the product of its elements. Finally, we will sum all these products together to get the final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(arr):\n       initialize total_sum to 0\n       for start_index from 0 to length of arr - 1:\n           initialize product to 1\n           for end_index from start_index to length of arr - 1:\n               multiply product by arr[end_index]\n               add product to total_sum\n       return total_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(arr):\n    # Initialize the total sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Loop through each starting index of the subarray\n    for start_index in range(len(arr)):\n        # Initialize the product for the current subarray\n        product = 1\n        \n        # Loop through each ending index of the subarray\n        for end_index in range(start_index, len(arr)):\n            # Multiply the current element to the product\n            product *= arr[end_index]\n            # Add the current product to the total sum\n            total_sum += product\n            \n    # Return the final sum of products of all subarrays\n    return total_sum\n```",
