For example, for the list [1, 2, 3], we need to find the sum of the products of all its sublists.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can generate all possible contiguous sublists of the input list.

Finally, we will sum all these products together to get the final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(arr):\n       initialize total_sum to 0\n       for start_index from 0 to length of arr - 1:\n           initialize product to 1\n           for end_index from start_index to length of arr - 1:\n               multiply product by arr[end_index]\n               add product to total_sum\n       return total_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(arr):\n    # Initialize the total sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Loop through each starting index of the subarray\n    for start_index in range(len(arr)):\n        # Initialize the product for the current subarray\n        product = 1\n        \n        # Loop through each ending index of the subarray\n        for end_index in range(start_index, len(arr)):\n            # Multiply the current element to the product\n            product *= arr[end_index]\n            # Add the current product to the total sum\n            total_sum += product\n            \n    # Return the final sum of products of all subarrays\n    return total_sum\n```"
