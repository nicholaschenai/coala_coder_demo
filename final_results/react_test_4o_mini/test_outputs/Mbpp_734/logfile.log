You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to find sum of products of all possible sublists of a given list.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/734 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of the products of all possible sublists (or contiguous subarrays) of a given list of integers. For example, for the list [1, 2, 3], we need to find the sum of the products of all its sublists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can generate all possible contiguous sublists of the input list. For each sublist, we will calculate the product of its elements. Finally, we will sum all these products together to get the final result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(arr):
       initialize total_sum to 0
       for start_index from 0 to length of arr - 1:
           initialize product to 1
           for end_index from start_index to length of arr - 1:
               multiply product by arr[end_index]
               add product to total_sum
       return total_sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(arr):
    # Initialize the total sum to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Loop through each starting index of the subarray
    for start_index in range(len(arr)):
        # Initialize the product for the current subarray
        product = 1
        
        # Loop through each ending index of the subarray
        for end_index in range(start_index, len(arr)):
            # Multiply the current element to the product
            product *= arr[end_index]
            # Add the current product to the total sum
            total_sum += product
            
    # Return the final sum of products of all subarrays
    return total_sum
