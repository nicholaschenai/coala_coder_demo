You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/772 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a string and an integer `k`, and removes all the words from the string that have a length of `k`. The function should return the modified string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Split the input string into individual words.
   - Iterate through the list of words and check the length of each word.
   - If a word's length is not equal to `k`, keep it; otherwise, discard it.
   - Join the remaining words back into a single string with spaces in between and return this new string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function remove_length(input_string, k):
       split input_string into words
       create an empty list for filtered words
       for each word in words:
           if length of word is not equal to k:
               add word to filtered words
       join filtered words into a single string with spaces
       return the new string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def remove_length(input_string: str, k: int) -> str:
    # Split the input string into individual words
    words = input_string.split()
