    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a string and an integer `k`, and removes all the words from the string that have a length of `k`. The function should return the modified string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - Split the input string into individual words.\n   - Iterate through the list of words and check the length of each word.\n   - If a word's length is not equal to `k`, keep it; otherwise, discard it.\n   - Join the remaining words back into a single string with spaces in between and return this new string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function remove_length(input_string, k):\n       split input_string into words\n       create an empty list for filtered words\n       for each word in words:\n           if length of word is not equal to k:\n               add word to filtered words\n       join filtered words into a single string with spaces\n       return the new string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef remove_length(input_string: str, k: int) -> str:\n    # Split the input string into individual words\n    words = input_string.split()\n    # Create an empty list to hold words that are not of length k\n    filtered_words = []\n    # Iterate through each word in the list of words\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if the length of the word is not equal to k\n        if len(word) != k:\n            # If not, add the word to the filtered list\n            filtered_words.append(word)\n    # Join the filtered words back into a single string with spaces\n    return ' '.join(filtered_words)\n```",
