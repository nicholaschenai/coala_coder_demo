INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/135 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/135 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the nth hexagonal number. A hexagonal number is a figurate number that represents a hexagon. The nth hexagonal number can be calculated using a specific formula.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   The formula for the nth hexagonal number is given by the equation: 
   \[
   H(n) = n(2n - 1)
   \]
   This means that to find the nth hexagonal number, we will multiply n by (2n - 1). We will implement this formula in a function that takes an integer n as input and returns the corresponding hexagonal number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION hexagonal_num(n):
       RETURN n * (2 * n - 1)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to calculate the nth hexagonal number
def hexagonal_num(n):
    # The formula for the nth hexagonal number is n * (2n - 1)
    return n * (2 * n - 1)
```
