A hexagonal number is a figurate number that represents a hexagon.

We will implement this formula in a function that takes an integer n as input and returns the corresponding hexagonal number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION hexagonal_num(n):\n       RETURN n * (2 * n - 1)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the nth hexagonal number\ndef hexagonal_num(n):\n    # The formula for the nth hexagonal number is n * (2n - 1)\n    return n * (2 * n - 1)\n```"
