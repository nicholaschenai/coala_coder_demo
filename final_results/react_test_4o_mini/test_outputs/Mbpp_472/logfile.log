You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/472 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given list of numbers contains consecutive integers. Consecutive integers are numbers that follow one after the other without any gaps.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if the numbers in the list are consecutive, we can follow these steps:
   - First, we need to sort the list of numbers.
   - Then, we will check if each number in the sorted list is exactly one more than the previous number.
   - If we find any number that does not follow this pattern, we will conclude that the list does not contain consecutive numbers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function check_Consecutive(numbers):
       if the list is empty:
           return False
       sort the list of numbers
       for i from 1 to length of numbers - 1:
           if numbers[i] is not equal to numbers[i - 1] + 1:
               return False
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:

def check_Consecutive(numbers):
    # Check if the list is empty
    if not numbers:
        return False
    
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Check for consecutive numbers
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        # If the current number is not equal to the previous number + 1, return False
        if numbers[i] != numbers[i - 1] + 1:
            return False
            
    # If all checks passed, return True
    return True
