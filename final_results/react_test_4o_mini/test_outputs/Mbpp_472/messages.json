Consecutive integers are numbers that follow one after the other without any gaps.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if the numbers in the list are consecutive, we can follow these steps:\n   - First, we need to sort the list of numbers.\n   - Then, we will check if each number in the sorted list is exactly one more than the previous number.\n   - If we find any number that does not follow this pattern, we will conclude that the list does not contain consecutive numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function check_Consecutive(numbers):\n       if the list is empty:\n           return False\n       sort the list of numbers\n       for i from 1 to length of numbers - 1:\n           if numbers[i] is not equal to numbers[i - 1] + 1:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef check_Consecutive(numbers):\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if not numbers:\n        return False\n    \n    # Sort the list of numbers\n    numbers.sort()\n    \n    # Check for consecutive numbers\n    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):\n        # If the current number is not equal to the previous number + 1, return False\n        if numbers[i] != numbers[i - 1] + 1:\n            return False\n            \n    # If all checks passed, return True\n    return True\n```"
