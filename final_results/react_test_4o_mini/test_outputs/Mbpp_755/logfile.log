You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/755 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the second smallest number from that list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the second smallest number, we can follow these steps:
   - First, we need to identify the smallest number in the list.
   - Then, we can filter out all occurrences of this smallest number from the list.
   - Finally, we will find the smallest number from the remaining numbers, which will be the second smallest number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function second_smallest(numbers):
       if the list has less than 2 unique numbers:
           return None (or some indication of insufficient numbers)
       smallest = find the smallest number in numbers
       create a new list excluding all occurrences of smallest
       second_smallest = find the smallest number in the new list
       return second_smallest
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def second_smallest(numbers):
    # Check if there are at least two unique numbers
    unique_numbers = list(set(numbers))
    if len(unique_numbers) < 2:
        return None  # Not enough unique numbers to find the second smallest
    
    # Find the smallest number
    smallest = min(unique_numbers)
    
    # Create a new list excluding all occurrences of the smallest number
    unique_numbers.remove(smallest)
    
    # Find the second smallest number from the remaining numbers
    second_smallest = min(unique_numbers)
    
    return second_smallest
```
