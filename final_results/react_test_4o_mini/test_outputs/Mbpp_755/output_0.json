    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the second smallest number from that list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To find the second smallest number, we can follow these steps:\n   - First, we need to identify the smallest number in the list.\n   - Then, we can filter out all occurrences of this smallest number from the list.\n   - Finally, we will find the smallest number from the remaining numbers, which will be the second smallest number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function second_smallest(numbers):\n       if the list has less than 2 unique numbers:\n           return None (or some indication of insufficient numbers)\n       smallest = find the smallest number in numbers\n       create a new list excluding all occurrences of smallest\n       second_smallest = find the smallest number in the new list\n       return second_smallest\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef second_smallest(numbers):\n    # Check if there are at least two unique numbers\n    unique_numbers = list(set(numbers))\n    if len(unique_numbers) < 2:\n        return None  # Not enough unique numbers to find the second smallest\n    \n    # Find the smallest number\n    smallest = min(unique_numbers)\n    \n    # Create a new list excluding all occurrences of the smallest number\n    unique_numbers.remove(smallest)\n    \n    # Find the second smallest number from the remaining numbers\n    second_smallest = min(unique_numbers)\n    \n    return second_smallest\n```",
