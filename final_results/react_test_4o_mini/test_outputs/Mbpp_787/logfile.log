INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/787 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function that matches a string that has an a followed by three 'b'.
assert not text_match_three("ac")

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/787 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given string contains the character 'a' followed immediately by exactly three 'b' characters. If the string does not match this pattern, the function should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can check if the string contains the substring "abbb". If it does, we return `True`. If it does not, we return `False`. We can also ensure that the string is long enough to contain this pattern before checking.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function text_match_three(s: string) -> bool:
       if length of s is less than 4:
           return False
       if s contains "abbb":
           return True
       return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def text_match_three(s: str) -> bool:
    # Check if the length of the string is less than 4
    if len(s) < 4:
        return False
    # Check if the string contains the substring "abbb"
    if "abbb" in s:
        return True
    # If neither condition is met, return False
    return False
