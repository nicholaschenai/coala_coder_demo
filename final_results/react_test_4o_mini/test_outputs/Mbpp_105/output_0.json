    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of boolean values (True or False) and counts how many of those values are True.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each element in the list and maintain a count of how many times we encounter the value True. At the end of the iteration, we will return this count.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count(boolean_list):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for each boolean in boolean_list:\n           if boolean is True:\n               increment count by 1\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count(boolean_list):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of True values\n    count = 0\n    # Iterate through each boolean in the provided list\n    for boolean in boolean_list:\n        # If the current boolean is True, increment the counter\n        if boolean is True:\n            count += 1\n    # Return the final count of True values\n    return count\n```",
