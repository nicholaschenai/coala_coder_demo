INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/105 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to count true booleans in the given list.
assert count([True,False,True]) == 2

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/105 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of boolean values (True or False) and counts how many of those values are True.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each element in the list and maintain a count of how many times we encounter the value True. At the end of the iteration, we will return this count.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function count(boolean_list):
       initialize count to 0
       for each boolean in boolean_list:
           if boolean is True:
               increment count by 1
       return count
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def count(boolean_list):
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of True values
    count = 0
    # Iterate through each boolean in the provided list
    for boolean in boolean_list:
        # If the current boolean is True, increment the counter
        if boolean is True:
            count += 1
    # Return the final count of True values
    return count
