You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/427 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a date in the format "yyyy-mm-dd" and converts it to the format "dd-mm-yyyy".

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To convert the date format, we can split the input string by the hyphen ("-") to separate the year, month, and day. After splitting, we can rearrange these components to form the new date format and then join them back together with hyphens.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function named `change_date_format` that takes a string input `date_str`.
   - Split `date_str` using the hyphen to get a list of components (year, month, day).
   - Rearrange the components to form a new list in the order of day, month, year.
   - Join the new list into a string with hyphens.
   - Return the newly formatted date string.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def change_date_format(date_str: str) -> str:
    # Split the input date string by the hyphen
    components = date_str.split('-')
    
    # Rearrange the components to the new format (day-month-year)
    new_format = [components[2], components[1], components[0]]
    
    # Join the new format components with hyphens
    formatted_date = '-'.join(new_format)
    
    # Return the newly formatted date string
    return formatted_date
