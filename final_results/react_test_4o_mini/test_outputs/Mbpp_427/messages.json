After splitting, we can rearrange these components to form the new date format and then join them back together with hyphens.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function named `change_date_format` that takes a string input `date_str`.\n   - Split `date_str` using the hyphen to get a list of components (year, month, day).\n   - Rearrange the components to form a new list in the order of day, month, year.\n   - Join the new list into a string with hyphens.\n   - Return the newly formatted date string.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef change_date_format(date_str: str) -> str:\n    # Split the input date string by the hyphen\n    components = date_str.split('-')\n    \n    # Rearrange the components to the new format (day-month-year)\n    new_format = [components[2], components[1], components[0]]\n    \n    # Join the new format components with hyphens\n    formatted_date = '-'.join(new_format)\n    \n    # Return the newly formatted date string\n    return formatted_date\n```"
