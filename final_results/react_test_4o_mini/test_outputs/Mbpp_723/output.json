    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes two lists of the same length and counts how many times the elements at the same index in both lists are equal.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through both lists simultaneously using their indices. For each index, we will check if the elements in both lists are the same. If they are, we will increment a counter. At the end of the iteration, we will return the counter which represents the number of indices where the values in both lists are equal.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_same_pair(list1, list2):\n       initialize a counter to 0\n       for each index from 0 to length of list1:\n           if list1[index] is equal to list2[index]:\n               increment the counter\n       return the counter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef count_same_pair(list1, list2):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of equal indices\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the indices of the lists\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        # Check if the elements at the current index are the same\n        if list1[i] == list2[i]:\n            # Increment the counter if they are equal\n            count += 1\n            \n    # Return the total count of equal indices\n    return count\n```",
