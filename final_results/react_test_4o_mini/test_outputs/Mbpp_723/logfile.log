You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/723 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes two lists of the same length and counts how many times the elements at the same index in both lists are equal.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through both lists simultaneously using their indices. For each index, we will check if the elements in both lists are the same. If they are, we will increment a counter. At the end of the iteration, we will return the counter which represents the number of indices where the values in both lists are equal.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_same_pair(list1, list2):
       initialize a counter to 0
       for each index from 0 to length of list1:
           if list1[index] is equal to list2[index]:
               increment the counter
       return the counter
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def count_same_pair(list1, list2):
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of equal indices
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through the indices of the lists
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        # Check if the elements at the current index are the same
        if list1[i] == list2[i]:
            # Increment the counter if they are equal
            count += 1
            
    # Return the total count of equal indices
    return count
