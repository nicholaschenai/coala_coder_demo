For each index, we will check if the elements in both lists are the same. If they are, we will increment a counter. At the end of the iteration, we will return the counter which represents the number of indices where the values in both lists are equal.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_same_pair(list1, list2):\n       initialize a counter to 0\n       for each index from 0 to length of list1:\n           if list1[index] is equal to list2[index]:\n               increment the counter\n       return the counter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef count_same_pair(list1, list2):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of equal indices\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the indices of the lists\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        # Check if the elements at the current index are the same\n        if list1[i] == list2[i]:\n            # Increment the counter if they are equal\n            count += 1\n            \n    # Return the total count of equal indices\n    return count\n```"
