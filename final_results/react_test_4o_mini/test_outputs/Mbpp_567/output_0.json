    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that checks if a given list of numbers is sorted in ascending order. If the list is sorted, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if the list is sorted, we can iterate through the list and compare each element with the next one. If we find any element that is greater than the following element, we can conclude that the list is not sorted and return `False`. If we reach the end of the list without finding any such pair, we return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function issort_list(lst):\n       for i from 0 to length of lst - 2:\n           if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef issort_list(lst):\n    # Iterate through the list from the first element to the second last element\n    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):\n        # Compare the current element with the next element\n        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:\n            # If the current element is greater, the list is not sorted\n            return False\n    # If no elements were found out of order, the list is sorted\n    return True\n```",
