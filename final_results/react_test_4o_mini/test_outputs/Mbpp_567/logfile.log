You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/567 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given list of numbers is sorted in ascending order. If the list is sorted, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if the list is sorted, we can iterate through the list and compare each element with the next one. If we find any element that is greater than the following element, we can conclude that the list is not sorted and return `False`. If we reach the end of the list without finding any such pair, we return `True`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function issort_list(lst):
       for i from 0 to length of lst - 2:
           if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
               return False
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def issort_list(lst):
    # Iterate through the list from the first element to the second last element
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        # Compare the current element with the next element
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            # If the current element is greater, the list is not sorted
            return False
    # If no elements were found out of order, the list is sorted
    return True
