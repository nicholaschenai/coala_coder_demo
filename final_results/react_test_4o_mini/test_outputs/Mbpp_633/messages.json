The function should take a list of integers and an integer representing the number of elements in the list, and return the total sum of the XOR results for all pairs.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Iterate through all unique pairs of numbers in the list.\n   - For each pair, calculate the XOR of the two numbers.\n   - Keep a running total of these XOR values.\n   - Finally, return the total sum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function pair_xor_Sum(numbers, n):\n       initialize total_sum to 0\n       for i from 0 to n-1:\n           for j from i+1 to n-1:\n               xor_value = numbers[i] XOR numbers[j]\n               total_sum += xor_value\n       return total_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef pair_xor_Sum(numbers, n):\n    # Initialize the total sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each unique pair of indices\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            # Calculate the XOR of the two numbers\n            xor_value = numbers[i] ^ numbers[j]\n            # Add the XOR value to the total sum\n            total_sum += xor_value\n            \n    # Return the total sum of all XOR values\n    return total_sum\n```"
