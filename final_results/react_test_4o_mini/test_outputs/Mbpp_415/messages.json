The function should return these two numbers as a tuple.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of integers and keep track of the two largest numbers we encounter. Once we have these two largest numbers, we can return them as they will yield the highest product. If the list has fewer than two numbers, we should handle that case appropriately.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function max_Product(arr):\n       if length of arr < 2:\n           return None  // or some indication of insufficient numbers\n       \n       initialize first_max and second_max to negative infinity\n       \n       for each number in arr:\n           if number > first_max:\n               update second_max to first_max\n               update first_max to number\n           else if number > second_max:\n               update second_max to number\n       \n       return (first_max, second_max)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef max_Product(arr):\n    # Check if the array has fewer than 2 elements\n    if len(arr) < 2:\n        return None  # or handle the case as needed\n    \n    # Initialize the two largest numbers\n    first_max = float('-inf')\n    second_max = float('-inf')\n    \n    # Iterate through the array to find the two largest numbers\n    for number in arr:\n        if number > first_max:\n            # Update second_max before updating first_max\n            second_max = first_max\n            first_max = number\n        elif number > second_max:\n            # Update second_max if number is less than first_max but greater than second_max\n            second_max = number\n    \n    # Return the two largest numbers as a tuple\n    return (first_max, second_max)\n```"

This indicates that while the two numbers are correct, their order in the tuple does not match the expected output.\n\n2. **Identifying the Problem:**\n   The function currently returns the two largest numbers in the order they were found, which is why we get `(8, 7)` instead of `(7, 8)`. The requirement is to return the numbers in the order they appear in the original list, with the larger number first.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong:**\n   The logic for finding the two largest numbers is correct, but I did not account for the order of the output. I need to ensure that when returning the tuple, the first element is the larger of the two numbers, and the second element is the smaller one.\n\n4. **Solution Adjustment:**\n   To fix this, I will modify the return statement to ensure that the larger number is always the first element in the tuple. \n\nNow, let's implement the corrected solution. \n\n```python\ndef max_Product(arr):\n    # Check if the array has fewer than 2 elements\n    if len(arr) < 2:\n        return None  # or handle the case as needed\n    \n    # Initialize the two largest numbers\n    first_max = float('-inf')\n    second_max = float('-inf')\n    \n    # Iterate through the array to find the two largest numbers\n    for number in arr:\n        if number > first_max:\n            # Update second_max before updating first_max\n            second_max = first_max\n            first_max = number\n        elif number > second_max:\n            # Update second_max if number is less than first_max but greater than second_max\n            second_max = number\n    \n    # Return the two largest numbers as a tuple in the correct order\n    return (second_max, first_max) if second_max > first_max else (first_max, second_max)\n```"
