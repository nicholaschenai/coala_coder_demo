    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and finds two numbers in that list whose product is the highest. The function should return these two numbers as a tuple.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of integers and keep track of the two largest numbers we encounter. Once we have these two largest numbers, we can return them as they will yield the highest product. If the list has fewer than two numbers, we should handle that case appropriately.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function max_Product(arr):\n       if length of arr < 2:\n           return None  // or some indication of insufficient numbers\n       \n       initialize first_max and second_max to negative infinity\n       \n       for each number in arr:\n           if number > first_max:\n               update second_max to first_max\n               update first_max to number\n           else if number > second_max:\n               update second_max to number\n       \n       return (first_max, second_max)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef max_Product(arr):\n    # Check if the array has fewer than 2 elements\n    if len(arr) < 2:\n        return None  # or handle the case as needed\n    \n    # Initialize the two largest numbers\n    first_max = float('-inf')\n    second_max = float('-inf')\n    \n    # Iterate through the array to find the two largest numbers\n    for number in arr:\n        if number > first_max:\n            # Update second_max before updating first_max\n            second_max = first_max\n            first_max = number\n        elif number > second_max:\n            # Update second_max if number is less than first_max but greater than second_max\n            second_max = number\n    \n    # Return the two largest numbers as a tuple\n    return (first_max, second_max)\n```",
