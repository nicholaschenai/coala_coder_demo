    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of floating-point numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, sums all the rounded numbers, and then multiplies that sum by the number of elements in the list. The final result should be returned.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - Start by defining a function that accepts a list of numbers.\n   - Initialize a variable to hold the sum of the rounded numbers.\n   - Loop through each number in the list, round it to the nearest integer, and add it to the sum.\n   - After processing all numbers, multiply the total sum by the length of the list.\n   - Return the final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function round_and_sum(numbers):\n       initialize total_sum to 0\n       for each number in numbers:\n           rounded_number = round(number)\n           total_sum += rounded_number\n       result = total_sum * length of numbers\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef round_and_sum(numbers):\n    # Initialize total_sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Loop through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Round the number to the nearest integer\n        rounded_number = round(number)\n        # Add the rounded number to total_sum\n        total_sum += rounded_number\n    \n    # Multiply the total sum by the length of the list\n    result = total_sum * len(numbers)\n    \n    # Return the final result\n    return result\n```",
