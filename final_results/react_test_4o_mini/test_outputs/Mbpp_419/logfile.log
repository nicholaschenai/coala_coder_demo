You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/419 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of floating-point numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, sums all the rounded numbers, and then multiplies that sum by the number of elements in the list. The final result should be returned.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Start by defining a function that accepts a list of numbers.
   - Initialize a variable to hold the sum of the rounded numbers.
   - Loop through each number in the list, round it to the nearest integer, and add it to the sum.
   - After processing all numbers, multiply the total sum by the length of the list.
   - Return the final result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function round_and_sum(numbers):
       initialize total_sum to 0
       for each number in numbers:
           rounded_number = round(number)
           total_sum += rounded_number
       result = total_sum * length of numbers
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def round_and_sum(numbers):
    # Initialize total_sum to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Loop through each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # Round the number to the nearest integer
        rounded_number = round(number)
        # Add the rounded number to total_sum
        total_sum += rounded_number
    
    # Multiply the total sum by the length of the list
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    
    # Return the final result
    return result
