INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/458 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/458 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the area of a rectangle given its width and height. The area is found by multiplying these two dimensions together.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the area of a rectangle, we will take two inputs: the width and the height. We will then multiply these two values to get the area. Finally, we will return the calculated area.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION rectangle_area(width, height):
       SET area = width * height
       RETURN area
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to calculate the area of a rectangle
def rectangle_area(width: int, height: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the area by multiplying width and height
    area = width * height
    # Return the calculated area
    return area
```
