    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the area of a rectangle given its width and height. The area is found by multiplying these two dimensions together.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the area of a rectangle, we will take two inputs: the width and the height. We will then multiply these two values to get the area. Finally, we will return the calculated area.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION rectangle_area(width, height):\n       SET area = width * height\n       RETURN area\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the area of a rectangle\ndef rectangle_area(width: int, height: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the area by multiplying width and height\n    area = width * height\n    # Return the calculated area\n    return area\n```",
