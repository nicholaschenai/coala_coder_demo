    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, we should find the sum of the cubes of the first two even natural numbers (2 and 4).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - Identify the first `n` even natural numbers. The first even natural number is 2, the second is 4, the third is 6, and so on. The `k`-th even natural number can be calculated as `2 * k`.\n   - For each of these even numbers, calculate its cube (which is the number multiplied by itself three times).\n   - Sum all these cubes together to get the final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function cube_Sum(n):\n       initialize sum to 0\n       for i from 1 to n:\n           even_number = 2 * i\n           cube = even_number * even_number * even_number\n           sum = sum + cube\n       return sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef cube_Sum(n):\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    # Loop through the first n even natural numbers\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the i-th even natural number\n        even_number = 2 * i\n        # Calculate the cube of the even number\n        cube = even_number * even_number * even_number\n        # Add the cube to the total sum\n        total_sum += cube\n    # Return the final sum of cubes\n    return total_sum\n```",
