You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/420 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, we should find the sum of the cubes of the first two even natural numbers (2 and 4).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Identify the first `n` even natural numbers. The first even natural number is 2, the second is 4, the third is 6, and so on. The `k`-th even natural number can be calculated as `2 * k`.
   - For each of these even numbers, calculate its cube (which is the number multiplied by itself three times).
   - Sum all these cubes together to get the final result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function cube_Sum(n):
       initialize sum to 0
       for i from 1 to n:
           even_number = 2 * i
           cube = even_number * even_number * even_number
           sum = sum + cube
       return sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def cube_Sum(n):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    total_sum = 0
    # Loop through the first n even natural numbers
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Calculate the i-th even natural number
        even_number = 2 * i
        # Calculate the cube of the even number
        cube = even_number * even_number * even_number
        # Add the cube to the total sum
        total_sum += cube
    # Return the final sum of cubes
    return total_sum
```
