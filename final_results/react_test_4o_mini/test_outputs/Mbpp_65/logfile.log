INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/65 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/65 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a nested list (a list that can contain other lists) and returns the sum of all the numbers in that list, regardless of how deeply nested they are.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. The function will check each element of the list:
   - If the element is a number, we will add it to our total sum.
   - If the element is another list, we will call the same function on that list to get its sum and add that to our total.
   This way, we can handle lists of any depth.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function recursive_list_sum(input_list):
       initialize total_sum to 0
       for each element in input_list:
           if element is a number:
               add element to total_sum
           else if element is a list:
               call recursive_list_sum on element and add the result to total_sum
       return total_sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def recursive_list_sum(input_list):
    # Initialize the total sum to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate through each element in the input list
    for element in input_list:
        # If the element is a number, add it to the total sum
        if isinstance(element, int):
            total_sum += element
        # If the element is a list, recursively call the function on that list
        elif isinstance(element, list):
            total_sum += recursive_list_sum(element)
    
    # Return the total sum of all elements
    return total_sum
