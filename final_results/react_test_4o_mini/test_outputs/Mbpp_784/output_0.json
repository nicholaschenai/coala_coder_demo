    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and finds the first even number and the first odd number in that list. Then, we will calculate the product of these two numbers and return the result.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - We will iterate through the list of numbers.\n   - We will keep track of the first even number we find and the first odd number we find.\n   - Once we have both the first even and first odd numbers, we will multiply them together and return the product.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function mul_even_odd(numbers):\n       initialize first_even as None\n       initialize first_odd as None\n       \n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is even and first_even is None:\n               set first_even to number\n           if number is odd and first_odd is None:\n               set first_odd to number\n           \n           if both first_even and first_odd are found:\n               break\n       \n       if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:\n           return first_even * first_odd\n       else:\n           return None  # or some indication that one of them was not found\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef mul_even_odd(numbers):\n    # Initialize variables to store the first even and odd numbers\n    first_even = None\n    first_odd = None\n    \n    # Iterate through the list of numbers\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is even and we haven't found an even number yet\n        if number % 2 == 0 and first_even is None:\n            first_even = number\n        # Check if the number is odd and we haven't found an odd number yet\n        if number % 2 != 0 and first_odd is None:\n            first_odd = number\n        \n        # If we have found both, we can stop searching\n        if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:\n            break\n    \n    # If both first_even and first_odd were found, return their product\n    if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:\n        return first_even * first_odd\n    else:\n        return None  # This case should not happen based on the problem statement\n```",
