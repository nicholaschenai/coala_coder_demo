You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find the product of first even and odd number of a given list.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/784 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and finds the first even number and the first odd number in that list. Then, we will calculate the product of these two numbers and return the result.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - We will iterate through the list of numbers.
   - We will keep track of the first even number we find and the first odd number we find.
   - Once we have both the first even and first odd numbers, we will multiply them together and return the product.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function mul_even_odd(numbers):
       initialize first_even as None
       initialize first_odd as None
       
       for each number in numbers:
           if number is even and first_even is None:
               set first_even to number
           if number is odd and first_odd is None:
               set first_odd to number
           
           if both first_even and first_odd are found:
               break
       
       if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:
           return first_even * first_odd
       else:
           return None  # or some indication that one of them was not found
   ```
