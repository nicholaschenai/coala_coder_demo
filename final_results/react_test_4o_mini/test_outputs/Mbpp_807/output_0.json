    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the first odd number found in that list. If there are no odd numbers, the function should not return anything.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each number in the list. For each number, we will check if it is odd (a number is odd if it is not divisible by 2). As soon as we find the first odd number, we will return it. If we finish checking all numbers without finding an odd one, we will simply return None.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function first_odd(numbers):\n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is odd:\n               return number\n       return None\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef first_odd(numbers):\n    # Iterate through each number in the provided list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is odd\n        if number % 2 != 0:\n            # Return the first odd number found\n            return number\n    # If no odd number is found, return None\n    return None\n```",
