INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/807 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to find the first odd number in a given list of numbers.
assert first_odd([1,3,5]) == 1

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/807 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the first odd number found in that list. If there are no odd numbers, the function should not return anything.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each number in the list. For each number, we will check if it is odd (a number is odd if it is not divisible by 2). As soon as we find the first odd number, we will return it. If we finish checking all numbers without finding an odd one, we will simply return None.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function first_odd(numbers):
       for each number in numbers:
           if number is odd:
               return number
       return None
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def first_odd(numbers):
    # Iterate through each number in the provided list
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the number is odd
        if number % 2 != 0:
            # Return the first odd number found
            return number
    # If no odd number is found, return None
    return None
