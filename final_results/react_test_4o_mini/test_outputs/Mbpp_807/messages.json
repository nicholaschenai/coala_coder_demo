If we finish checking all numbers without finding an odd one, we will simply return None.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function first_odd(numbers):\n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is odd:\n               return number\n       return None\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef first_odd(numbers):\n    # Iterate through each number in the provided list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is odd\n        if number % 2 != 0:\n            # Return the first odd number found\n            return number\n    # If no odd number is found, return None\n    return None\n```"
