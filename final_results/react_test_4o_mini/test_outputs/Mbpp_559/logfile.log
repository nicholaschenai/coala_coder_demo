You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/559 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and finds the sum of the largest contiguous sublist within that list. A contiguous sublist is a sequence of elements that are next to each other in the list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a technique called Kadane's Algorithm. The idea is to iterate through the list while keeping track of two values: the maximum sum of the sublist found so far and the current sum of the sublist we are evaluating. If the current sum becomes negative, we reset it to zero because starting a new sublist from the next element could yield a higher sum. We will update the maximum sum whenever the current sum exceeds it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_sub_array_sum(arr, n):
       initialize max_sum to negative infinity
       initialize current_sum to 0
       
       for each number in arr:
           add number to current_sum
           if current_sum > max_sum:
               update max_sum to current_sum
           if current_sum < 0:
               reset current_sum to 0
       
       return max_sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def max_sub_array_sum(arr, n):
    # Initialize max_sum to a very small number
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    # Initialize current_sum to 0
    current_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate through each number in the array
    for number in arr:
        # Add the current number to current_sum
