        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and finds the sum of the largest contiguous sublist within that list. A contiguous sublist is a sequence of elements that are next to each other in the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can use a technique called Kadane's Algorithm. The idea is to iterate through the list while keeping track of two values: the maximum sum of the sublist found so far and the current sum of the sublist we are evaluating. If the current sum becomes negative, we reset it to zero because starting a new sublist from the next element could yield a higher sum. We will update the maximum sum whenever the current sum exceeds it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function max_sub_array_sum(arr, n):\n       initialize max_sum to negative infinity\n       initialize current_sum to 0\n       \n       for each number in arr:\n           add number to current_sum\n           if current_sum > max_sum:\n               update max_sum to current_sum\n           if current_sum < 0:\n               reset current_sum to 0\n       \n       return max_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef max_sub_array_sum(arr, n):\n    # Initialize max_sum to a very small number\n    max_sum = float('-inf')\n    # Initialize current_sum to 0\n    current_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the array\n    for number in arr:\n        # Add the current number to current_sum\n        current_sum += number\n        \n        # Update max_sum if current_sum is greater\n        if current_sum > max_sum:\n            max_sum = current_sum\n        \n        # If current_sum drops below 0, reset it to 0\n        if current_sum < 0:\n            current_sum = 0\n            \n    # Return the maximum sum found\n    return max_sum\n```"
