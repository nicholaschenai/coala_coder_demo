The function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the sums of the corresponding elements from the input tuples.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through all possible pairs of tuples from the input list. For each pair, we will calculate the sum of the first elements and the sum of the second elements. We will store these sums as new tuples in a result list. Finally, we will return the result list containing all the unique combinations of sums.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function find_combinations(tuple_list):\n       initialize an empty list for results\n       for each tuple i in tuple_list:\n           for each tuple j in tuple_list:\n               calculate sum1 as i[0] + j[0]\n               calculate sum2 as i[1] + j[1]\n               create a new tuple (sum1, sum2)\n               add the new tuple to results\n       return results\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef find_combinations(tuple_list):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the results\n    results = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the list\n    for i in tuple_list:\n        for j in tuple_list:\n            # Calculate the sums of the first and second elements\n            sum1 = i[0] + j[0]\n            sum2 = i[1] + j[1]\n            # Create a new tuple with the calculated sums\n            new_tuple = (sum1, sum2)\n            # Add the new tuple to the results list\n            results.append(new_tuple)\n    \n    # Return the list of results containing all combinations of sums\n    return results\n```"

Each tuple contains two integers, and we need to create new tuples by summing the first elements of two tuples and the second elements of the same two tuples.\n\n2. **Identifying the Mistake:**\n   In the previous solution, I iterated through all pairs of tuples, which is correct. However, I did not account for the requirement of unique combinations of sums. The expected output suggests that we should only include unique tuples in the result.\n\n3. **Expected Output Analysis:**\n   The expected output for the input `[(2, 4), (6, 7), (5, 1), (6, 10)]` is `[(8, 11), (7, 5), (8, 14), (11, 8), (12, 17), (11, 11)]`. This indicates that not all combinations are needed, and we should only include unique sums.\n\n4. **Correcting the Approach:**\n   To fix the code, I will:\n   - Use a set to store the results to ensure uniqueness.\n   - Convert the set back to a list before returning it.\n\n5. **Revising the Code:**\n   I will implement these changes in the code to ensure that only unique combinations of sums are returned.\n\nHere\u2019s the revised solution:\n\n```python\ndef find_combinations(tuple_list):\n    # Initialize a set to store unique results\n    results = set()\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the list\n    for i in tuple_list:\n        for j in tuple_list:\n            # Calculate the sums of the first and second elements\n            sum1 = i[0] + j[0]\n            sum2 = i[1] + j[1]\n            # Create a new tuple with the calculated sums\n            new_tuple = (sum1, sum2)\n            # Add the new tuple to the results set for uniqueness\n            results.add(new_tuple)\n    \n    # Convert the set back to a list and return it\n    return list(results)\n``` \n\nThis code should now correctly return only unique combinations of sums as required."
