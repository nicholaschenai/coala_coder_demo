    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the sums of the corresponding elements from the input tuples.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through all possible pairs of tuples from the input list. For each pair, we will calculate the sum of the first elements and the sum of the second elements. We will store these sums as new tuples in a result list. Finally, we will return the result list containing all the unique combinations of sums.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function find_combinations(tuple_list):\n       initialize an empty list for results\n       for each tuple i in tuple_list:\n           for each tuple j in tuple_list:\n               calculate sum1 as i[0] + j[0]\n               calculate sum2 as i[1] + j[1]\n               create a new tuple (sum1, sum2)\n               add the new tuple to results\n       return results\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef find_combinations(tuple_list):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the results\n    results = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the list\n    for i in tuple_list:\n        for j in tuple_list:\n            # Calculate the sums of the first and second elements\n            sum1 = i[0] + j[0]\n            sum2 = i[1] + j[1]\n            # Create a new tuple with the calculated sums\n            new_tuple = (sum1, sum2)\n            # Add the new tuple to the results list\n            results.append(new_tuple)\n    \n    # Return the list of results containing all combinations of sums\n    return results\n```",
