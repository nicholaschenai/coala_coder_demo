You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/287 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of the squares of the first `n` even natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, the first two even natural numbers are 2 and 4, and their squares are 4 and 16, respectively. The sum of these squares is 20.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Initialize a variable to hold the sum of squares.
   - Loop through the first `n` even natural numbers. The `k`-th even natural number can be calculated as `2 * k`.
   - For each even number, calculate its square and add it to the sum.
   - Finally, return the total sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function square_Sum(n):
       initialize sum_of_squares to 0
       for k from 1 to n:
           even_number = 2 * k
           square = even_number * even_number
           sum_of_squares = sum_of_squares + square
       return sum_of_squares
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def square_Sum(n):
    # Initialize a variable to hold the sum of squares
    sum_of_squares = 0
    
    # Loop through the first n even natural numbers
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        # Calculate the k-th even natural number
        even_number = 2 * k
        
        # Calculate the square of the even number
        square = even_number * even_number
        
        # Add the square to the sum of squares
        sum_of_squares += square
    
    # Return the total sum of squares
    return sum_of_squares
