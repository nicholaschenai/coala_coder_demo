        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes an integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of the squares of the first `n` even natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, the first two even natural numbers are 2 and 4, and their squares are 4 and 16, respectively. The sum of these squares is 20.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - Initialize a variable to hold the sum of squares.\n   - Loop through the first `n` even natural numbers. The `k`-th even natural number can be calculated as `2 * k`.\n   - For each even number, calculate its square and add it to the sum.\n   - Finally, return the total sum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function square_Sum(n):\n       initialize sum_of_squares to 0\n       for k from 1 to n:\n           even_number = 2 * k\n           square = even_number * even_number\n           sum_of_squares = sum_of_squares + square\n       return sum_of_squares\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef square_Sum(n):\n    # Initialize a variable to hold the sum of squares\n    sum_of_squares = 0\n    \n    # Loop through the first n even natural numbers\n    for k in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the k-th even natural number\n        even_number = 2 * k\n        \n        # Calculate the square of the even number\n        square = even_number * even_number\n        \n        # Add the square to the sum of squares\n        sum_of_squares += square\n    \n    # Return the total sum of squares\n    return sum_of_squares\n```"
