This will give us the largest integer that is less than `n`. \n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION closest_num(n):\n       RETURN n - 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function that takes an integer n\ndef closest_num(n: int) -> int:\n    # Return the closest smaller number by subtracting 1 from n\n    return n - 1\n```",
