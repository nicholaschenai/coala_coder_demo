INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/89 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find the closest smaller number than n.
assert closest_num(11) == 10

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/89 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a number `n` as input and returns the largest integer that is smaller than `n`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the closest smaller number than `n`, we can simply subtract 1 from `n`. This will give us the largest integer that is less than `n`. 

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION closest_num(n):
       RETURN n - 1
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function that takes an integer n
def closest_num(n: int) -> int:
    # Return the closest smaller number by subtracting 1 from n
    return n - 1
```
INFO - program_code:
