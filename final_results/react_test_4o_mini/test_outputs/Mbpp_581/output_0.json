    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the surface area of a square pyramid given the length of one side of its square base (base edge) and its height. The function should return the surface area as an integer.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the surface area of a square pyramid, we need to calculate the area of the base and the area of the four triangular faces. The area of the base is simply the square of the base edge length. The area of each triangular face can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle (1/2 * base * height). The height of each triangular face can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, where the height of the triangle is the slant height of the pyramid.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function surface_Area(base_edge: float, height: float) -> float:\n       base_area = base_edge * base_edge\n       slant_height = sqrt((base_edge / 2) ** 2 + height ** 2)\n       triangle_area = (1/2) * base_edge * slant_height\n       total_surface_area = base_area + (4 * triangle_area)\n       return total_surface_area\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef surface_Area(base_edge: float, height: float) -> float:\n    # Calculate the area of the base\n    base_area = base_edge * base_edge\n    \n    # Calculate the slant height using the Pythagorean theorem\n    slant_height = ((base_edge / 2) ** 2 + height ** 2) ** 0.5\n    \n    # Calculate the area of one triangular face\n    triangle_area = (1/2) * base_edge * slant_height\n    \n    # Total surface area is the base area plus the area of the four triangular faces\n    total_surface_area = base_area + (4 * triangle_area)\n    \n    return total_surface_area\n```",
