You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/797 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of all odd natural numbers between two given numbers, `l` and `r`, inclusive.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Initialize a variable to hold the sum of odd numbers.
   - Loop through all numbers from `l` to `r`.
   - For each number, check if it is odd (a number is odd if it is not divisible by 2).
   - If the number is odd, add it to the sum.
   - Finally, return the total sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sum_in_range(l, r):
       initialize sum to 0
       for each number from l to r:
           if number is odd:
               add number to sum
       return sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def sum_in_range(l: int, r: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Loop through each number from l to r
    for number in range(l, r + 1):
        # Check if the number is odd
        if number % 2 != 0:
            # Add the odd number to the total sum
            total_sum += number
            
    # Return the total sum of odd numbers
    return total_sum
```
