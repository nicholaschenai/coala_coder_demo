You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/753 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name and a number. The function should return the minimum `k` records based on the numerical values in the tuples. The output should be a list of the `k` tuples with the smallest numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to:
   - Sort the list of tuples based on the numerical values in ascending order.
   - Select the first `k` tuples from the sorted list, as these will represent the minimum records.
   - Return this selection as the output.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function min_k(records, k):
       sort records by the second element of each tuple
       select the first k elements from the sorted records
       return the selected elements
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def min_k(records, k):
    # Sort the records based on the second element of each tuple (the number)
    sorted_records = sorted(records, key=lambda x: x[1])
    # Select the first k elements from the sorted records
    min_records = sorted_records[:k]
    # Return the selected elements
    return min_records
