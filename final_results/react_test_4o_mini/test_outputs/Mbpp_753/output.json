    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The task is to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name and a number. The function should return the minimum `k` records based on the numerical values in the tuples. The output should be a list of the `k` tuples with the smallest numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Sort the list of tuples based on the numerical values in ascending order.\n   - Select the first `k` tuples from the sorted list, as these will represent the minimum records.\n   - Return this selection as the output.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function min_k(records, k):\n       sort records by the second element of each tuple\n       select the first k elements from the sorted records\n       return the selected elements\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef min_k(records, k):\n    # Sort the records based on the second element of each tuple (the number)\n    sorted_records = sorted(records, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    # Select the first k elements from the sorted records\n    min_records = sorted_records[:k]\n    # Return the selected elements\n    return min_records\n```",
