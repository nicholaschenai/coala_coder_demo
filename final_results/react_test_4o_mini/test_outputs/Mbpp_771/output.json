    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that checks if a given string of brackets (parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets) is balanced. A string is considered balanced if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if the expression is balanced, we can use a stack data structure. We will iterate through each character in the string:\n   - If we encounter an opening bracket (i.e., '(', '{', or '['), we will push it onto the stack.\n   - If we encounter a closing bracket (i.e., ')', '}', or ']'), we will check if the stack is not empty and if the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If it is, we pop the top of the stack. If not, the expression is unbalanced.\n   - At the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, the expression is balanced; otherwise, it is unbalanced.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function check_expression(expression):\n       create an empty stack\n       for each character in expression:\n           if character is '(', '{', or '[':\n               push character onto the stack\n           else if character is ')', '}', or ']':\n               if stack is empty:\n                   return False\n               top = pop from stack\n               if character does not match top:\n                   return False\n       return True if stack is empty, else return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef check_expression(expression: str) -> bool:\n    # Create an empty stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Define a mapping of closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets\n    bracket_map = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the expression\n    for char in expression:\n        # If the character is one of the closing brackets\n        if char in bracket_map:\n            # Check if the stack is empty\n            if not stack:\n                return False\n            # Pop the top element from the stack\n            top = stack.pop()\n            # Check if the popped element matches the corresponding opening bracket\n            if bracket_map[char] != top:\n                return False\n        # If the character is one of the opening brackets, push it onto the stack\n        elif char in bracket_map.values():\n            stack.append(char)\n    \n    # If the stack is empty, all brackets were balanced; otherwise, they were not\n    return len(stack) == 0\n```",
