You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/771 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given string of brackets (parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets) is balanced. A string is considered balanced if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if the expression is balanced, we can use a stack data structure. We will iterate through each character in the string:
   - If we encounter an opening bracket (i.e., '(', '{', or '['), we will push it onto the stack.
   - If we encounter a closing bracket (i.e., ')', '}', or ']'), we will check if the stack is not empty and if the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If it is, we pop the top of the stack. If not, the expression is unbalanced.
   - At the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, the expression is balanced; otherwise, it is unbalanced.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function check_expression(expression):
       create an empty stack
       for each character in expression:
           if character is '(', '{', or '[':
               push character onto the stack
           else if character is ')', '}', or ']':
               if stack is empty:
                   return False
               top = pop from stack
               if character does not match top:
                   return False
       return True if stack is empty, else return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
