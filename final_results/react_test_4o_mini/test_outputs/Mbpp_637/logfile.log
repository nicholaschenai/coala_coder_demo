INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/637 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/637 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a given amount of money has neither gained profit nor incurred a loss. This means we want to determine if the two amounts provided are equal.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will compare two amounts. If they are equal, it indicates that there is no profit and no loss, and we will return `True`. If they are not equal, we will return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Function noprofit_noloss(amount1, amount2):
       If amount1 is equal to amount2:
           Return True
       Else:
           Return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
# Define a function to check for no profit and no loss
def noprofit_noloss(amount1: int, amount2: int) -> bool:
    # Check if the two amounts are equal
    if amount1 == amount2:
        # If they are equal, return True (no profit, no loss)
        return True
    else:
        # If they are not equal, return False (there is profit or loss)
        return False
```
