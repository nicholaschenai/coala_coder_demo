    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that checks if a given amount of money has neither gained profit nor incurred a loss. This means we want to determine if the two amounts provided are equal.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we will compare two amounts. If they are equal, it indicates that there is no profit and no loss, and we will return `True`. If they are not equal, we will return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Function noprofit_noloss(amount1, amount2):\n       If amount1 is equal to amount2:\n           Return True\n       Else:\n           Return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\n# Define a function to check for no profit and no loss\ndef noprofit_noloss(amount1: int, amount2: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the two amounts are equal\n    if amount1 == amount2:\n        # If they are equal, return True (no profit, no loss)\n        return True\n    else:\n        # If they are not equal, return False (there is profit or loss)\n        return False\n```",
