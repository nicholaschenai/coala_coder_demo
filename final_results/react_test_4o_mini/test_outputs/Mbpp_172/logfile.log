INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/172 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to count the number of occurence of the string 'std' in a given string.
assert count_occurance("letstdlenstdporstd") == 3

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/172 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that counts how many times the substring "std" appears in a given string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the given string and check for occurrences of the substring "std". Each time we find it, we will increment a counter. At the end of the iteration, we will return the counter value.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Initialize a counter to zero.
   - Loop through the string from the start to the end.
   - For each position in the string, check if the substring starting at that position matches "std".
   - If it matches, increment the counter.
   - After checking all positions, return the counter.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def count_occurance(s: str) -> int:
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of occurrences
    count = 0
    # Get the length of the string
    length = len(s)
    # Loop through the string
    for i in range(length - 2):  # We stop at length - 2 to avoid index out of range
        # Check if the substring from the current index matches 'std'
        if s[i:i+3] == 'std':
            count += 1  # Increment the counter if a match is found
    # Return the total count of occurrences
    return count
