    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that counts how many times the substring \"std\" appears in a given string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the given string and check for occurrences of the substring \"std\". Each time we find it, we will increment a counter. At the end of the iteration, we will return the counter value.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Initialize a counter to zero.\n   - Loop through the string from the start to the end.\n   - For each position in the string, check if the substring starting at that position matches \"std\".\n   - If it matches, increment the counter.\n   - After checking all positions, return the counter.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_occurance(s: str) -> int:\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of occurrences\n    count = 0\n    # Get the length of the string\n    length = len(s)\n    # Loop through the string\n    for i in range(length - 2):  # We stop at length - 2 to avoid index out of range\n        # Check if the substring from the current index matches 'std'\n        if s[i:i+3] == 'std':\n            count += 1  # Increment the counter if a match is found\n    # Return the total count of occurrences\n    return count\n```",
