    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that counts how many pairs of numbers in a given list add up to a specified sum. A pair consists of two numbers, and the same number can be used multiple times if it appears multiple times in the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can use a nested loop approach. For each number in the list, we will check every other number (including itself) to see if their sum equals the specified target sum. We will keep a count of how many such pairs we find. Since the order of the pairs does not matter (i.e., (a, b) is the same as (b, a)), we will ensure that we only count each unique pair once.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function get_pairs_count(numbers, target_sum):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for i from 0 to length of numbers - 1:\n           for j from i to length of numbers - 1:\n               if numbers[i] + numbers[j] equals target_sum:\n                   increment count\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef get_pairs_count(numbers, target_sum):\n    # Initialize a counter for the pairs\n    count = 0\n    # Loop through each number in the list\n    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n        # Loop through the numbers starting from the current index to avoid double counting\n        for j in range(i, len(numbers)):\n            # Check if the sum of the current pair equals the target sum\n            if numbers[i] + numbers[j] == target_sum:\n                # Increment the count for each valid pair found\n                count += 1\n    # Return the total count of pairs found\n    return count\n```",
