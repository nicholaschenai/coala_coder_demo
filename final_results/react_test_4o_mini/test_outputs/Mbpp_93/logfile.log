You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/93 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes two numbers, 'a' and 'b', and calculates 'a' raised to the power of 'b'. For example, if 'a' is 3 and 'b' is 4, the function should return 81, since 3 to the power of 4 equals 81.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To calculate 'a' to the power of 'b', we can use a loop to multiply 'a' by itself 'b' times. If 'b' is 0, we should return 1, since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. If 'b' is negative, we can calculate the positive power and then take the reciprocal of the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function power(a, b):
       if b is 0:
           return 1
       if b is negative:
           result = 1
           for i from 1 to abs(b):
               result = result * a
           return 1 / result
       result = 1
       for i from 1 to b:
           result = result * a
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def power(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    # Check if the exponent b is 0
    if b == 0:
        return 1  # Any number to the power of 0 is 1
    
    # Check if the exponent b is negative
    if b < 0:
        result = 1
        # Calculate the positive power
        for i in range(1, -b + 1):
            result *= a
        return 1 / result  # Return the reciprocal for negative exponent
    
    result = 1
    # Calculate the power for positive b
    for i in range(1, b + 1):
        result *= a
    return result  # Return the final result
