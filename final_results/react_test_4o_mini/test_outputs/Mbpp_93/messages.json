        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes two numbers, 'a' and 'b', and calculates 'a' raised to the power of 'b'. For example, if 'a' is 3 and 'b' is 4, the function should return 81, since 3 to the power of 4 equals 81.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To calculate 'a' to the power of 'b', we can use a loop to multiply 'a' by itself 'b' times. If 'b' is 0, we should return 1, since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. If 'b' is negative, we can calculate the positive power and then take the reciprocal of the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function power(a, b):\n       if b is 0:\n           return 1\n       if b is negative:\n           result = 1\n           for i from 1 to abs(b):\n               result = result * a\n           return 1 / result\n       result = 1\n       for i from 1 to b:\n           result = result * a\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef power(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    # Check if the exponent b is 0\n    if b == 0:\n        return 1  # Any number to the power of 0 is 1\n    \n    # Check if the exponent b is negative\n    if b < 0:\n        result = 1\n        # Calculate the positive power\n        for i in range(1, -b + 1):\n            result *= a\n        return 1 / result  # Return the reciprocal for negative exponent\n    \n    result = 1\n    # Calculate the power for positive b\n    for i in range(1, b + 1):\n        result *= a\n    return result  # Return the final result\n```"
