You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/276 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = Ï€ * rÂ² * h, where r is the radius and h is the height.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will define a function that takes two parameters: the radius and the height of the cylinder. Inside the function, we will use the formula for the volume of a cylinder. We will use the value of Ï€ (pi) as approximately 3.141592653589793. Finally, we will return the calculated volume.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION volume_cylinder(radius, height):
       SET pi = 3.141592653589793
       CALCULATE volume = pi * (radius ** 2) * height
       RETURN volume
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to calculate the volume of a cylinder
def volume_cylinder(radius, height):
    # Set the value of pi
    pi = 3.141592653589793
    # Calculate the volume using the formula V = Ï€ * rÂ² * h
    volume = pi * (radius ** 2) * height
    # Return the calculated volume
    return volume
