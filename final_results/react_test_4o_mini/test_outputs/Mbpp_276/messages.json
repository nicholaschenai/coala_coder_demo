The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h, where r is the radius and h is the height.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will define a function that takes two parameters: the radius and the height of the cylinder. Inside the function, we will use the formula for the volume of a cylinder. We will use the value of \u03c0 (pi) as approximately 3.141592653589793. Finally, we will return the calculated volume.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION volume_cylinder(radius, height):\n       SET pi = 3.141592653589793\n       CALCULATE volume = pi * (radius ** 2) * height\n       RETURN volume\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the volume of a cylinder\ndef volume_cylinder(radius, height):\n    # Set the value of pi\n    pi = 3.141592653589793\n    # Calculate the volume using the formula V = \u03c0 * r\u00b2 * h\n    volume = pi * (radius ** 2) * height\n    # Return the calculated volume\n    return volume\n```"
