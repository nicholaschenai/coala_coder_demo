For each element in the original list, we check if it is the same as the last added element. If it is not, we add it to the new list. This way, we ensure that only the first occurrence of consecutive duplicates is kept.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function consecutive_duplicates(input_list):\n       if input_list is empty:\n           return empty list\n       create an empty list called result\n       set last_element to None\n       for each element in input_list:\n           if element is not equal to last_element:\n               append element to result\n               set last_element to element\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef consecutive_duplicates(input_list):\n    # Check if the input list is empty\n    if not input_list:\n        return []\n    \n    # Create an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    # Initialize the last_element variable to None\n    last_element = None\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the input list\n    for element in input_list:\n        # If the current element is not the same as the last added element\n        if element != last_element:\n            # Append the current element to the result list\n            result.append(element)\n            # Update last_element to the current element\n            last_element = element\n            \n    # Return the result list with consecutive duplicates removed\n    return result\n```"
