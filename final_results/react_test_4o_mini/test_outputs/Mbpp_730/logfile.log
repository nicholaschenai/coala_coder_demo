You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/730 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that takes a list of elements and removes any consecutive duplicates, meaning if the same element appears one after the other, only the first occurrence should be kept.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list while keeping track of the last unique element we added to a new list. For each element in the original list, we check if it is the same as the last added element. If it is not, we add it to the new list. This way, we ensure that only the first occurrence of consecutive duplicates is kept.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function consecutive_duplicates(input_list):
       if input_list is empty:
           return empty list
       create an empty list called result
       set last_element to None
       for each element in input_list:
           if element is not equal to last_element:
               append element to result
               set last_element to element
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def consecutive_duplicates(input_list):
    # Check if the input list is empty
    if not input_list:
        return []
    
    # Create an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    # Initialize the last_element variable to None
    last_element = None
    
    # Iterate through each element in the input list
    for element in input_list:
        # If the current element is not the same as the last added element
        if element != last_element:
            # Append the current element to the result list
            result.append(element)
            # Update last_element to the current element
            last_element = element
