You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/623 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and an integer `n`, and returns a new list where each number in the original list is raised to the power of `n`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each number in the input list, compute its n-th power using the exponentiation operator, and store the results in a new list. Finally, we will return this new list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION nth_nums(numbers, n):
       CREATE an empty list called result
       FOR each number in numbers:
           RAISE the number to the power of n
           APPEND the result to the result list
       RETURN the result list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def nth_nums(numbers, n):
    # Create an empty list to store the results
    result = []
    # Iterate through each number in the input list
    for number in numbers:
        # Raise the number to the power of n and append to the result list
        result.append(number ** n)
    # Return the final result list
    return result
