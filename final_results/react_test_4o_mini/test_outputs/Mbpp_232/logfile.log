You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/232 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and an integer `n`, and returns a new list containing the `n` largest unique numbers from the original list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - First, we will remove any duplicate numbers from the list to ensure that we only consider unique values.
   - Next, we will sort the unique numbers in descending order so that the largest numbers come first.
   - Finally, we will select the first `n` numbers from this sorted list and return them as a new list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function larg_nnum(input_list, n):
       unique_numbers = remove duplicates from input_list
       sort unique_numbers in descending order
       return the first n elements from unique_numbers
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def larg_nnum(input_list, n):
    # Step 1: Remove duplicates by converting the list to a set
    unique_numbers = list(set(input_list))
    
    # Step 2: Sort the unique numbers in descending order
    unique_numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Step 3: Return the first n elements from the sorted list
    return unique_numbers[:n]
```
