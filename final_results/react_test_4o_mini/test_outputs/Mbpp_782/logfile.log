You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/782 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of all subarrays of a given list that have an odd length. A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible starting points of subarrays in the list. For each starting point, we can then create subarrays of odd lengths and calculate their sums. We will keep a running total of these sums and return it at the end.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function odd_length_sum(arr):
       total_sum = 0
       n = length of arr
       for start from 0 to n-1:
           for length from 1 to n-start:
               if length is odd:
                   subarray = arr[start:start+length]
                   total_sum += sum of subarray
       return total_sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def odd_length_sum(arr):
    # Initialize the total sum to 0
    total_sum = 0
    # Get the length of the array
    n = len(arr)
    
    # Iterate over each starting index for subarrays
    for start in range(n):
        # Iterate over the length of the subarray
        for length in range(1, n - start + 1):
            # Check if the length is odd
            if length % 2 == 1:
                # Calculate the subarray and add its sum to total_sum
                total_sum += sum(arr[start:start + length])
    
    # Return the total sum of all odd length subarrays
    return total_sum
