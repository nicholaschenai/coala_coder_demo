A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible starting points of subarrays in the list. For each starting point, we can then create subarrays of odd lengths and calculate their sums. We will keep a running total of these sums and return it at the end.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function odd_length_sum(arr):\n       total_sum = 0\n       n = length of arr\n       for start from 0 to n-1:\n           for length from 1 to n-start:\n               if length is odd:\n                   subarray = arr[start:start+length]\n                   total_sum += sum of subarray\n       return total_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef odd_length_sum(arr):\n    # Initialize the total sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    # Get the length of the array\n    n = len(arr)\n    \n    # Iterate over each starting index for subarrays\n    for start in range(n):\n        # Iterate over the length of the subarray\n        for length in range(1, n - start + 1):\n            # Check if the length is odd\n            if length % 2 == 1:\n                # Calculate the subarray and add its sum to total_sum\n                total_sum += sum(arr[start:start + length])\n    \n    # Return the total sum of all odd length subarrays\n    return total_sum\n```"
