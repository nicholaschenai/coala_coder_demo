The size should match the size returned by the built-in `sys.getsizeof()` function when applied to the same tuple.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the size of a tuple, we can use the built-in `sys.getsizeof()` function, which returns the memory size of an object in bytes. We will create a function that takes a tuple as input and returns the size of that tuple using `sys.getsizeof()`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Import the `sys` module.\n   - Define a function named `tuple_size` that takes one parameter (a tuple).\n   - Inside the function, use `sys.getsizeof()` to get the size of the tuple.\n   - Return the size.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nimport sys  # Importing the sys module to use getsizeof function\n\n# Define the function to calculate the size of a tuple\ndef tuple_size(t: tuple) -> int:\n    # Use sys.getsizeof to get the size of the tuple in bytes\n    return sys.getsizeof(t)\n\n```"
