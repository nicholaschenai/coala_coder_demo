INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/596 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find the size in bytes of the given tuple.
assert tuple_size(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3) ) == sys.getsizeof(("A", 1, "B", 2, "C", 3))

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/596 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the size in bytes of a given tuple. The size should match the size returned by the built-in `sys.getsizeof()` function when applied to the same tuple.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the size of a tuple, we can use the built-in `sys.getsizeof()` function, which returns the memory size of an object in bytes. We will create a function that takes a tuple as input and returns the size of that tuple using `sys.getsizeof()`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Import the `sys` module.
   - Define a function named `tuple_size` that takes one parameter (a tuple).
   - Inside the function, use `sys.getsizeof()` to get the size of the tuple.
   - Return the size.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
import sys  # Importing the sys module to use getsizeof function

# Define the function to calculate the size of a tuple
def tuple_size(t: tuple) -> int:
    # Use sys.getsizeof to get the size of the tuple in bytes
    return sys.getsizeof(t)
