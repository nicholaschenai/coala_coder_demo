You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to find the sum of the largest and smallest value in a given array.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/476 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the largest and smallest numbers in that list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Identify the smallest number in the list.
   - Identify the largest number in the list.
   - Calculate the sum of these two numbers.
   - Return the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION big_sum(array):
       IF array is empty:
           RETURN 0
       SET smallest = first element of array
       SET largest = first element of array
       FOR each number in array:
           IF number < smallest:
               smallest = number
           IF number > largest:
               largest = number
       RETURN smallest + largest
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def big_sum(array):
    # Check if the array is empty
    if not array:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize smallest and largest with the first element
    smallest = array[0]
    largest = array[0]
    
    # Iterate through each number in the array
    for number in array:
        # Update smallest if the current number is smaller
        if number < smallest:
            smallest = number
        # Update largest if the current number is larger
        if number > largest:
            largest = number
            
    # Return the sum of the smallest and largest numbers
    return smallest + largest
```
