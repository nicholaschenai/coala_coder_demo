INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/282 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/282 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes two lists of numbers and subtracts the corresponding elements from each other. The result should be a new list containing the differences.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through both lists simultaneously, subtracting the element from the second list from the corresponding element in the first list. We will store these differences in a new list and return that list as the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Function sub_list(list1, list2):
       Initialize an empty list called result
       For each index i from 0 to the length of list1:
           Calculate the difference between list1[i] and list2[i]
           Append the difference to result
       Return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def sub_list(list1, list2):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results
    result = []
    # Iterate through the indices of the lists
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        # Subtract the corresponding elements and append to the result list
        result.append(list1[i] - list2[i])
    # Return the final result list
    return result
