    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples as input. Each tuple contains integers, and our goal is to calculate the total sum of all the integers present in these tuples.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each tuple in the list. For each tuple, we will then iterate through its elements and add them to a cumulative total. Finally, we will return this total sum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function cummulative_sum(tuple_list):\n       initialize total_sum to 0\n       for each tuple in tuple_list:\n           for each number in tuple:\n               add number to total_sum\n       return total_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef cummulative_sum(tuple_list):\n    # Initialize the total sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the list\n    for tup in tuple_list:\n        # Iterate through each number in the current tuple\n        for number in tup:\n            # Add the number to the total sum\n            total_sum += number\n            \n    # Return the cumulative sum\n    return total_sum\n```",
