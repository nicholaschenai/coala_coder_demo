You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/104 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists, where each inner list contains strings. The function should sort each inner list alphabetically and return a new list of these sorted inner lists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - We will iterate through each inner list in the main list.
   - For each inner list, we will sort the strings in alphabetical order.
   - We will collect these sorted inner lists into a new list and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function sort_sublists(input_list):
       create an empty list called sorted_list
       for each sublist in input_list:
           sort the sublist
           append the sorted sublist to sorted_list
       return sorted_list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def sort_sublists(input_list):
    # Create an empty list to hold the sorted sublists
    sorted_list = []
    
    # Iterate through each sublist in the input list
    for sublist in input_list:
        # Sort the current sublist
        sorted_sublist = sorted(sublist)
        # Append the sorted sublist to the sorted_list
        sorted_list.append(sorted_sublist)
    
    # Return the list of sorted sublists
    return sorted_list
