You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/618 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes two lists of numbers and divides the corresponding elements of the first list by the elements of the second list. The result should be a new list containing the results of these divisions.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - We will define a function that accepts two lists as input.
   - We will iterate through both lists simultaneously, dividing each element of the first list by the corresponding element of the second list.
   - We will store the results of these divisions in a new list.
   - Finally, we will return the new list containing the results.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function div_list(list1, list2):
       create an empty result list
       for each index i from 0 to length of list1:
           divide list1[i] by list2[i] and append the result to the result list
       return the result list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def div_list(list1, list2):
    # Create an empty list to store the results
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through both lists using their indices
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        # Divide the elements of the first list by the corresponding elements of the second list
        division_result = list1[i] / list2[i]
        # Append the result to the result list
        result.append(division_result)
    
    # Return the final list containing the division results
    return result
