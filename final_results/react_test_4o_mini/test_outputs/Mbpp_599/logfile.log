You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/599 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the sum and average of the first `n` natural numbers. The function should return these two values as a tuple.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, we can use the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`. The average can be calculated by dividing the sum by `n`. Finally, we will return both the sum and the average as a tuple.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Function sum_average(n):
       Calculate sum using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2
       Calculate average by dividing sum by n
       Return (sum, average) as a tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def sum_average(n):
    # Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula
    total_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2  # Using integer division for sum
    # Calculate the average
    average = total_sum / n  # Average is the sum divided by n
    # Return the sum and average as a tuple
    return (total_sum, average)
```
