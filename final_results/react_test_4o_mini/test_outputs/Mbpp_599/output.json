    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the sum and average of the first `n` natural numbers. The function should return these two values as a tuple.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, we can use the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`. The average can be calculated by dividing the sum by `n`. Finally, we will return both the sum and the average as a tuple.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Function sum_average(n):\n       Calculate sum using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2\n       Calculate average by dividing sum by n\n       Return (sum, average) as a tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef sum_average(n):\n    # Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula\n    total_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2  # Using integer division for sum\n    # Calculate the average\n    average = total_sum / n  # Average is the sum divided by n\n    # Return the sum and average as a tuple\n    return (total_sum, average)\n```",
