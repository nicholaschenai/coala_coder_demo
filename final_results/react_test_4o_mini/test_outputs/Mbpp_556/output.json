    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that counts how many pairs of numbers in a given list have an XOR value that is odd. The function should take a list of integers and an integer representing the length of the list as input and return the count of such pairs.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To determine if the XOR of two numbers is odd, we can use the property that the XOR of two numbers is odd if one number is even and the other is odd. Therefore, we can count the number of even and odd numbers in the list. The number of valid pairs can then be calculated by multiplying the count of even numbers by the count of odd numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Initialize two counters: `even_count` and `odd_count` to zero.\n   - Loop through each number in the input list:\n     - If the number is even, increment `even_count`.\n     - If the number is odd, increment `odd_count`.\n   - The result will be the product of `even_count` and `odd_count`.\n   - Return the result.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_Odd_Pair(arr, n):\n    # Initialize counters for even and odd numbers\n    even_count = 0\n    odd_count = 0\n    \n    # Loop through each number in the array\n    for num in arr:\n        # Check if the number is even\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_count += 1  # Increment even counter\n        else:\n            odd_count += 1   # Increment odd counter\n    \n    # The number of pairs with odd XOR is the product of even and odd counts\n    return even_count * odd_count\n```",
