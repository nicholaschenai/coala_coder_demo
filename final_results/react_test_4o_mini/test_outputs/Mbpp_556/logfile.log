You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/556 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that counts how many pairs of numbers in a given list have an XOR value that is odd. The function should take a list of integers and an integer representing the length of the list as input and return the count of such pairs.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To determine if the XOR of two numbers is odd, we can use the property that the XOR of two numbers is odd if one number is even and the other is odd. Therefore, we can count the number of even and odd numbers in the list. The number of valid pairs can then be calculated by multiplying the count of even numbers by the count of odd numbers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Initialize two counters: `even_count` and `odd_count` to zero.
   - Loop through each number in the input list:
     - If the number is even, increment `even_count`.
     - If the number is odd, increment `odd_count`.
   - The result will be the product of `even_count` and `odd_count`.
   - Return the result.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def find_Odd_Pair(arr, n):
    # Initialize counters for even and odd numbers
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    # Loop through each number in the array
    for num in arr:
        # Check if the number is even
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1  # Increment even counter
        else:
            odd_count += 1   # Increment odd counter
    
    # The number of pairs with odd XOR is the product of even and odd counts
    return even_count * odd_count
