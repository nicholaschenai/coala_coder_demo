    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that checks if a given string contains the letter 'z', but only if it is not located at the very beginning or the very end of the string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can check the string for the presence of 'z' starting from the second character and ending at the second-to-last character. If 'z' is found in this range, we will return `True`. If 'z' is not found or is located at the start or end of the string, we will return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function `text_match_wordz_middle` that takes a string as input.\n   - Check if the length of the string is less than 3. If it is, return `False` (since there can't be a 'z' in the middle).\n   - Extract the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character.\n   - Check if 'z' is in this substring.\n   - Return `True` if 'z' is found, otherwise return `False`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef text_match_wordz_middle(s: str) -> bool:\n    # Check if the string is too short to have 'z' in the middle\n    if len(s) < 3:\n        return False\n    \n    # Extract the middle part of the string\n    middle_substring = s[1:-1]\n    \n    # Check if 'z' is in the middle substring\n    return 'z' in middle_substring\n```",
