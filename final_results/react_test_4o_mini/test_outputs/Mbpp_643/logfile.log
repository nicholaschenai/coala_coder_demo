You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/643 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given string contains the letter 'z', but only if it is not located at the very beginning or the very end of the string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can check the string for the presence of 'z' starting from the second character and ending at the second-to-last character. If 'z' is found in this range, we will return `True`. If 'z' is not found or is located at the start or end of the string, we will return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function `text_match_wordz_middle` that takes a string as input.
   - Check if the length of the string is less than 3. If it is, return `False` (since there can't be a 'z' in the middle).
   - Extract the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character.
   - Check if 'z' is in this substring.
   - Return `True` if 'z' is found, otherwise return `False`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def text_match_wordz_middle(s: str) -> bool:
    # Check if the string is too short to have 'z' in the middle
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    
    # Extract the middle part of the string
    middle_substring = s[1:-1]
    
    # Check if 'z' is in the middle substring
    return 'z' in middle_substring
```
