If the count of divisors is even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To determine the number of divisors of a number, we can iterate through all integers from 1 to that number and count how many of them divide the number evenly (i.e., with no remainder). After counting the divisors, we will check if this count is even or odd. If it is even, we return `True`; if it is odd, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_divisors(n):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for i from 1 to n:\n           if n is divisible by i:\n               increment count\n       if count is even:\n           return True\n       else:\n           return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef count_divisors(n):\n    # Initialize a counter for the number of divisors\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Loop through all numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Check if i is a divisor of n\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # Increment the count if it is a divisor\n            count += 1\n            \n    # Check if the count of divisors is even\n    if count % 2 == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```"
