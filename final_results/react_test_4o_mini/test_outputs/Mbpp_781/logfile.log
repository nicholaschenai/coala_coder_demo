INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/781 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/781 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if the number of divisors of a given integer is even. If the count of divisors is even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To determine the number of divisors of a number, we can iterate through all integers from 1 to that number and count how many of them divide the number evenly (i.e., with no remainder). After counting the divisors, we will check if this count is even or odd. If it is even, we return `True`; if it is odd, we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_divisors(n):
       initialize count to 0
       for i from 1 to n:
           if n is divisible by i:
               increment count
       if count is even:
           return True
       else:
           return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def count_divisors(n):
    # Initialize a counter for the number of divisors
    count = 0
    
    # Loop through all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Check if i is a divisor of n
        if n % i == 0:
            # Increment the count if it is a divisor
            count += 1
            
    # Check if the count of divisors is even
    if count % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
