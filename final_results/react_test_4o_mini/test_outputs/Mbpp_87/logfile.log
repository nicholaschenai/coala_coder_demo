You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/87 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes three dictionaries as input and combines them into a single dictionary. If there are any duplicate keys among the dictionaries, the value from the last dictionary should be used.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To merge the three dictionaries, we can start with an empty dictionary and then add the key-value pairs from each of the three dictionaries one by one. If a key already exists in the resulting dictionary, it will be updated with the new value from the last dictionary.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function named `merge_dictionaries_three` that takes three dictionaries as parameters.
   - Initialize an empty dictionary to hold the merged result.
   - For each dictionary in the input:
     - Iterate through each key-value pair in the dictionary.
     - Add the key-value pair to the result dictionary (this will overwrite any existing key).
   - Return the merged result dictionary.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def merge_dictionaries_three(dict1, dict2, dict3):
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the merged result
    merged_dict = {}
    
    # Iterate through the first dictionary and add its items to the merged dictionary
    for key, value in dict1.items():
        merged_dict[key] = value
    
    # Iterate through the second dictionary and add its items to the merged dictionary
    for key, value in dict2.items():
        merged_dict[key] = value
    
    # Iterate through the third dictionary and add its items to the merged dictionary
    for key, value in dict3.items():
        merged_dict[key] = value
    
    # Return the merged dictionary
    return merged_dict
