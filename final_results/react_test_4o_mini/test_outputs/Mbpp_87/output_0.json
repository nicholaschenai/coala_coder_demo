    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes three dictionaries as input and combines them into a single dictionary. If there are any duplicate keys among the dictionaries, the value from the last dictionary should be used.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To merge the three dictionaries, we can start with an empty dictionary and then add the key-value pairs from each of the three dictionaries one by one. If a key already exists in the resulting dictionary, it will be updated with the new value from the last dictionary.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function named `merge_dictionaries_three` that takes three dictionaries as parameters.\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to hold the merged result.\n   - For each dictionary in the input:\n     - Iterate through each key-value pair in the dictionary.\n     - Add the key-value pair to the result dictionary (this will overwrite any existing key).\n   - Return the merged result dictionary.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries_three(dict1, dict2, dict3):\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the merged result\n    merged_dict = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through the first dictionary and add its items to the merged dictionary\n    for key, value in dict1.items():\n        merged_dict[key] = value\n    \n    # Iterate through the second dictionary and add its items to the merged dictionary\n    for key, value in dict2.items():\n        merged_dict[key] = value\n    \n    # Iterate through the third dictionary and add its items to the merged dictionary\n    for key, value in dict3.items():\n        merged_dict[key] = value\n    \n    # Return the merged dictionary\n    return merged_dict\n```",
