INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/242 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to count the total number of characters in a string.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/242 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that counts the total number of characters in a given string, including letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use the built-in `len()` function in Python, which returns the number of items in an object. In this case, we will pass the string to `len()` to get the total character count.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION count_charac(input_string):
       RETURN the length of input_string using len()
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to count the total number of characters in a string
def count_charac(input_string: str) -> int:
    # Use the built-in len() function to get the length of the input string
    return len(input_string)
```
