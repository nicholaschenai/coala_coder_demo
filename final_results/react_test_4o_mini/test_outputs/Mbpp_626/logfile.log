You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/626 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the area of the largest triangle that can fit inside a semicircle with a given radius. If the radius is negative, the function should return `None`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula: 
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]
   For a triangle inscribed in a semicircle, the largest triangle is an isosceles triangle where the base lies on the diameter of the semicircle. The height of this triangle will be equal to the radius of the semicircle. Therefore, the area can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{diameter} \times \text{radius} = \frac{1}{2} \times (2 \times \text{radius}) \times \text{radius} = \text{radius}^2
   \]
   If the radius is negative, we will return `None`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function triangle_area(radius):
       if radius < 0:
           return None
       else:
           area = radius * radius
           return area
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def triangle_area(radius):
    # Check if the radius is negative
    if radius < 0:
        return None  # Return None for negative radius
    else:
        # Calculate the area of the largest triangle inscribed in the semicircle
        area = radius * radius  # Area is radius squared
        return area  # Return the calculated area
