If the radius is negative, the function should return `None`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n   \\]\n   For a triangle inscribed in a semicircle, the largest triangle is an isosceles triangle where the base lies on the diameter of the semicircle. The height of this triangle will be equal to the radius of the semicircle. Therefore, the area can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{diameter} \\times \\text{radius} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (2 \\times \\text{radius}) \\times \\text{radius} = \\text{radius}^2\n   \\]\n   If the radius is negative, we will return `None`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function triangle_area(radius):\n       if radius < 0:\n           return None\n       else:\n           area = radius * radius\n           return area\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef triangle_area(radius):\n    # Check if the radius is negative\n    if radius < 0:\n        return None  # Return None for negative radius\n    else:\n        # Calculate the area of the largest triangle inscribed in the semicircle\n        area = radius * radius  # Area is radius squared\n        return area  # Return the calculated area\n```"
