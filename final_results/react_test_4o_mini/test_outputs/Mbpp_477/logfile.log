You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/477 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and converts all the characters in that string to lowercase. The function should return the modified string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To convert a string to lowercase, we can iterate through each character in the string, check if it is an uppercase letter, and if so, convert it to its corresponding lowercase letter. We can build a new string with these lowercase characters and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function named `is_lower` that takes a string parameter.
   - Initialize an empty string to hold the result.
   - Loop through each character in the input string:
     - If the character is between 'A' and 'Z', convert it to lowercase by adding 32 to its ASCII value and append it to the result string.
     - If the character is not uppercase, append it as is to the result string.
   - Return the result string.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def is_lower(s: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty string to hold the result
    result = ""
    
    # Loop through each character in the input string
    for char in s:
        # Check if the character is uppercase
        if 'A' <= char <= 'Z':
            # Convert to lowercase by adding 32 to its ASCII value
            result += chr(ord(char) + 32)
        else:
            # Append the character as is
            result += char
            
    # Return the result string
    return result
```
