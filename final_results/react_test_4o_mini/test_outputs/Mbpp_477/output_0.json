    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and converts all the characters in that string to lowercase. The function should return the modified string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To convert a string to lowercase, we can iterate through each character in the string, check if it is an uppercase letter, and if so, convert it to its corresponding lowercase letter. We can build a new string with these lowercase characters and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function named `is_lower` that takes a string parameter.\n   - Initialize an empty string to hold the result.\n   - Loop through each character in the input string:\n     - If the character is between 'A' and 'Z', convert it to lowercase by adding 32 to its ASCII value and append it to the result string.\n     - If the character is not uppercase, append it as is to the result string.\n   - Return the result string.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef is_lower(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty string to hold the result\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Loop through each character in the input string\n    for char in s:\n        # Check if the character is uppercase\n        if 'A' <= char <= 'Z':\n            # Convert to lowercase by adding 32 to its ASCII value\n            result += chr(ord(char) + 32)\n        else:\n            # Append the character as is\n            result += char\n            \n    # Return the result string\n    return result\n```",
