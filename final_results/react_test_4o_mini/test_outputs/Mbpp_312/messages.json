We will use this formula in our function to compute the volume based on the inputs provided.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function named `volume_cone` that takes two parameters: `radius` and `height`.\n   - Calculate the volume using the formula \\( V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h \\).\n   - Return the calculated volume.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Function to calculate the volume of a cone\ndef volume_cone(radius: float, height: float) -> float:\n    # Calculate the volume using the formula for the volume of a cone\n    volume = (1/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 2) * height\n    return volume\n```"
