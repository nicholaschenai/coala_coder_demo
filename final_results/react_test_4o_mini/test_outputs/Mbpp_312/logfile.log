You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/312 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height. The volume of a cone can be calculated using a specific mathematical formula.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   The formula for the volume of a cone is given by the equation: 
   \[
   V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
   \]
   where \( V \) is the volume, \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cone, and \( h \) is the height of the cone. We will use this formula in our function to compute the volume based on the inputs provided.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function named `volume_cone` that takes two parameters: `radius` and `height`.
   - Calculate the volume using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \).
   - Return the calculated volume.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
import math

# Function to calculate the volume of a cone
def volume_cone(radius: float, height: float) -> float:
    # Calculate the volume using the formula for the volume of a cone
    volume = (1/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 2) * height
    return volume
