A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To find the next smallest palindrome, we can start from the integer immediately greater than the input number. We will check each subsequent number to see if it is a palindrome. If it is, we return that number. To check if a number is a palindrome, we can convert it to a string and see if the string is the same when reversed.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function next_smallest_palindrome(n):\n       start from n + 1\n       while true:\n           if is_palindrome(current_number):\n               return current_number\n           increment current_number\n       \n   function is_palindrome(num):\n       convert num to string\n       check if string is equal to its reverse\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(num):\n    # Convert the number to a string\n    s = str(num)\n    # Check if the string is equal to its reverse\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\ndef next_smallest_palindrome(n):\n    # Start checking from the next integer\n    current_number = n + 1\n    # Loop indefinitely until we find a palindrome\n    while True:\n        # If the current number is a palindrome, return it\n        if is_palindrome(current_number):\n            return current_number\n        # Increment the current number to check the next one\n        current_number += 1\n```"
