INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/100 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find the next smallest palindrome of a specified integer, returned as an integer.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/100 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes an integer as input and finds the next smallest palindrome that is greater than the given integer. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the next smallest palindrome, we can start from the integer immediately greater than the input number. We will check each subsequent number to see if it is a palindrome. If it is, we return that number. To check if a number is a palindrome, we can convert it to a string and see if the string is the same when reversed.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function next_smallest_palindrome(n):
       start from n + 1
       while true:
           if is_palindrome(current_number):
               return current_number
           increment current_number
       
   function is_palindrome(num):
       convert num to string
       check if string is equal to its reverse
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def is_palindrome(num):
    # Convert the number to a string
    s = str(num)
    # Check if the string is equal to its reverse
    return s == s[::-1]

def next_smallest_palindrome(n):
    # Start checking from the next integer
    current_number = n + 1
    # Loop indefinitely until we find a palindrome
    while True:
        # If the current number is a palindrome, return it
        if is_palindrome(current_number):
            return current_number
        # Increment the current number to check the next one
        current_number += 1
