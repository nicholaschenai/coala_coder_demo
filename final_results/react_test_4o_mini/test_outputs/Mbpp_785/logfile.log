You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/785 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that takes a string representation of a tuple (for example, "(7, 8, 9)") and converts it into an actual tuple of integers (in this case, (7, 8, 9)).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to:
   - Remove the parentheses from the string.
   - Split the remaining string by commas to get individual string representations of the numbers.
   - Convert each of these string representations into integers.
   - Finally, return these integers as a tuple.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   FUNCTION tuple_str_int(input_string):
       REMOVE the parentheses from input_string
       SPLIT the string by commas to get a list of number strings
       CONVERT each number string in the list to an integer
       RETURN the list of integers as a tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def tuple_str_int(input_string: str) -> tuple:
    # Remove the parentheses from the input string
    cleaned_string = input_string.strip("()")
    
    # Split the cleaned string by commas to get a list of number strings
    number_strings = cleaned_string.split(",")
    
    # Convert each number string to an integer
    number_tuples = tuple(int(num.strip()) for num in number_strings)
    
    # Return the tuple of integers
    return number_tuples
