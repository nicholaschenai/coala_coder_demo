The function should reverse the elements of the array from the start up to the specified position, while keeping the rest of the array unchanged.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - First, we will check if the given position is valid (i.e., it should not exceed the length of the array).\n   - We will then slice the array into two parts: the part that needs to be reversed (from the start to the given position) and the part that remains unchanged (from the position to the end).\n   - We will reverse the first part and concatenate it with the unchanged part to form the final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function reverse_Array_Upto_K(array, k):\n       if k is greater than the length of array:\n           set k to the length of array\n       slice the array into two parts:\n           part1 = array[0:k] (this part will be reversed)\n           part2 = array[k:] (this part will remain unchanged)\n       reverse part1\n       concatenate reversed part1 with part2\n       return the concatenated result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef reverse_Array_Upto_K(array, k):\n    # Check if k exceeds the length of the array\n    if k > len(array):\n        k = len(array)  # Adjust k to the length of the array if necessary\n    \n    # Slice the array into two parts\n    part1 = array[:k]  # This part will be reversed\n    part2 = array[k:]  # This part will remain unchanged\n    \n    # Reverse part1\n    part1.reverse()\n    \n    # Concatenate reversed part1 with part2\n    return part1 + part2  # Return the final result\n```"
