You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/644 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes an array (list) and a position (integer) as inputs. The function should reverse the elements of the array from the start up to the specified position, while keeping the rest of the array unchanged.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - First, we will check if the given position is valid (i.e., it should not exceed the length of the array).
   - We will then slice the array into two parts: the part that needs to be reversed (from the start to the given position) and the part that remains unchanged (from the position to the end).
   - We will reverse the first part and concatenate it with the unchanged part to form the final result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function reverse_Array_Upto_K(array, k):
       if k is greater than the length of array:
           set k to the length of array
       slice the array into two parts:
           part1 = array[0:k] (this part will be reversed)
           part2 = array[k:] (this part will remain unchanged)
       reverse part1
       concatenate reversed part1 with part2
       return the concatenated result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def reverse_Array_Upto_K(array, k):
    # Check if k exceeds the length of the array
    if k > len(array):
        k = len(array)  # Adjust k to the length of the array if necessary
    
    # Slice the array into two parts
    part1 = array[:k]  # This part will be reversed
    part2 = array[k:]  # This part will remain unchanged
    
    # Reverse part1
    part1.reverse()
    
    # Concatenate reversed part1 with part2
    return part1 + part2  # Return the final result
