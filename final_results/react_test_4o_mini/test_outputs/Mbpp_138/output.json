    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that checks if a given number can be expressed as the sum of non-zero powers of 2. For example, the number 10 can be represented as 2^3 (which is 8) + 2^1 (which is 2), so the function should return True for 10.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if a number can be represented as a sum of non-zero powers of 2, we can use the binary representation of the number. Each bit in the binary representation corresponds to a power of 2. If the binary representation has a '1' in a position, it means that the corresponding power of 2 is included in the sum. Therefore, we can check if the number is greater than zero and then convert it to binary to see if it can be expressed as a sum of powers of 2.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n):\n       if n <= 0:\n           return False\n       convert n to binary\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n):\n    # Check if the number is less than or equal to zero\n    if n <= 0:\n        return False\n    \n    # Convert the number to binary and check if it has any '1's\n    # If n is greater than zero, it can be represented as a sum of powers of 2\n    return True\n```",
