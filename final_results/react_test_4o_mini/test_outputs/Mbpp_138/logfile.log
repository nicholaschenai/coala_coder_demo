INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/138 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to check whether the given number can be represented as sum of non-zero powers of 2 or not.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/138 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given number can be expressed as the sum of non-zero powers of 2. For example, the number 10 can be represented as 2^3 (which is 8) + 2^1 (which is 2), so the function should return True for 10.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if a number can be represented as a sum of non-zero powers of 2, we can use the binary representation of the number. Each bit in the binary representation corresponds to a power of 2. If the binary representation has a '1' in a position, it means that the corresponding power of 2 is included in the sum. Therefore, we can check if the number is greater than zero and then convert it to binary to see if it can be expressed as a sum of powers of 2.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n):
       if n <= 0:
           return False
       convert n to binary
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n):
    # Check if the number is less than or equal to zero
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    
    # Convert the number to binary and check if it has any '1's
    # If n is greater than zero, it can be represented as a sum of powers of 2
    return True
