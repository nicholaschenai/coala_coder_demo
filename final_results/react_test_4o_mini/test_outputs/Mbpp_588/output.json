    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and calculates the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in that list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - First, we will find the largest number in the list.\n   - Then, we will find the smallest number in the list.\n   - Finally, we will subtract the smallest number from the largest number to get the difference.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function big_diff(numbers):\n       if the list is empty:\n           return 0\n       largest = find the maximum value in numbers\n       smallest = find the minimum value in numbers\n       difference = largest - smallest\n       return difference\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef big_diff(numbers):\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if not numbers:\n        return 0  # Return 0 for an empty list (though not specified, it's a safe guard)\n    \n    # Find the largest number in the list\n    largest = max(numbers)\n    \n    # Find the smallest number in the list\n    smallest = min(numbers)\n    \n    # Calculate the difference between largest and smallest\n    difference = largest - smallest\n    \n    # Return the calculated difference\n    return difference\n```",
