You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/588 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and calculates the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in that list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - First, we will find the largest number in the list.
   - Then, we will find the smallest number in the list.
   - Finally, we will subtract the smallest number from the largest number to get the difference.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function big_diff(numbers):
       if the list is empty:
           return 0
       largest = find the maximum value in numbers
       smallest = find the minimum value in numbers
       difference = largest - smallest
       return difference
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def big_diff(numbers):
    # Check if the list is empty
    if not numbers:
        return 0  # Return 0 for an empty list (though not specified, it's a safe guard)
    
    # Find the largest number in the list
    largest = max(numbers)
    
    # Find the smallest number in the list
    smallest = min(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the difference between largest and smallest
    difference = largest - smallest
    
    # Return the calculated difference
    return difference
```

    # Find the smallest number in the list
    smallest = min(numbers)
