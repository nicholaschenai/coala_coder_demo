INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/470 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find the pairwise addition of the neighboring elements of the given tuple.
assert add_pairwise((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (6, 12, 15, 18)

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/470 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple. This new tuple should contain the sums of each pair of neighboring elements from the original tuple.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through the elements of the input tuple. For each element, we will add it to the next element (its neighbor). We will store these sums in a new tuple. The process will continue until we reach the second-to-last element, as the last element does not have a neighbor to pair with.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function add_pairwise(input_tuple):
       create an empty list to store results
       for i from 0 to length of input_tuple - 2:
           sum = input_tuple[i] + input_tuple[i + 1]
           append sum to results list
       convert results list to a tuple
       return the tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def add_pairwise(input_tuple):
    # Create an empty list to store the results
    results = []
    
    # Iterate through the tuple up to the second-to-last element
    for i in range(len(input_tuple) - 1):
        # Calculate the sum of the current element and the next element
        sum_pair = input_tuple[i] + input_tuple[i + 1]
        # Append the sum to the results list
        results.append(sum_pair)
    
    # Convert the results list to a tuple and return it
    return tuple(results)
