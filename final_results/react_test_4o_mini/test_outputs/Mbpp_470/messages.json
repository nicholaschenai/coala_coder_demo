This new tuple should contain the sums of each pair of neighboring elements from the original tuple.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through the elements of the input tuple. For each element, we will add it to the next element (its neighbor). We will store these sums in a new tuple. The process will continue until we reach the second-to-last element, as the last element does not have a neighbor to pair with.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function add_pairwise(input_tuple):\n       create an empty list to store results\n       for i from 0 to length of input_tuple - 2:\n           sum = input_tuple[i] + input_tuple[i + 1]\n           append sum to results list\n       convert results list to a tuple\n       return the tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef add_pairwise(input_tuple):\n    # Create an empty list to store the results\n    results = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the tuple up to the second-to-last element\n    for i in range(len(input_tuple) - 1):\n        # Calculate the sum of the current element and the next element\n        sum_pair = input_tuple[i] + input_tuple[i + 1]\n        # Append the sum to the results list\n        results.append(sum_pair)\n    \n    # Convert the results list to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(results)\n```"
