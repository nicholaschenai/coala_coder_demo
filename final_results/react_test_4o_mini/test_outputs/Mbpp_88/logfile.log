You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/88 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a dictionary where each unique number from the list is a key, and its value is the count of how many times that number appears in the list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of numbers. For each number, we will check if it is already a key in our dictionary. If it is, we will increment its count. If it is not, we will add it to the dictionary with a count of 1. At the end of the iteration, we will have a complete dictionary that represents the frequency of each number in the list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function freq_count(numbers):
       create an empty dictionary called frequency
       for each number in numbers:
           if number is in frequency:
               increment frequency[number] by 1
           else:
               set frequency[number] to 1
       return frequency
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def freq_count(numbers):
    # Create an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each number
    frequency = {}
    
    # Iterate through each number in the input list
    for number in numbers:
        # If the number is already a key in the dictionary
        if number in frequency:
            # Increment its count by 1
            frequency[number] += 1
        else:
            # Otherwise, add the number to the dictionary with a count of 1
            frequency[number] = 1
            
    # Return the dictionary containing the frequency of each number
    return frequency
