    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a dictionary where each unique number from the list is a key, and its value is the count of how many times that number appears in the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of numbers. For each number, we will check if it is already a key in our dictionary. If it is, we will increment its count. If it is not, we will add it to the dictionary with a count of 1. At the end of the iteration, we will have a complete dictionary that represents the frequency of each number in the list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function freq_count(numbers):\n       create an empty dictionary called frequency\n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is in frequency:\n               increment frequency[number] by 1\n           else:\n               set frequency[number] to 1\n       return frequency\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef freq_count(numbers):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each number\n    frequency = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the input list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # If the number is already a key in the dictionary\n        if number in frequency:\n            # Increment its count by 1\n            frequency[number] += 1\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, add the number to the dictionary with a count of 1\n            frequency[number] = 1\n            \n    # Return the dictionary containing the frequency of each number\n    return frequency\n```",
