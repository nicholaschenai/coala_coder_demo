You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to remove duplicate numbers from a given number of lists.
assert two_unique_nums([1,2,3,2,3,4,5]) == [1, 4, 5]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/572 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the numbers that appear exactly once in the original list. 

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in the list. After counting, we can iterate through the dictionary to collect the numbers that have a count of one. Finally, we will return this collection as a list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function `two_unique_nums` that takes a list as input.
   - Create an empty dictionary to store the count of each number.
   - Loop through each number in the list:
     - If the number is already in the dictionary, increment its count.
     - If it is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of one.
   - Create an empty list to store the unique numbers.
   - Loop through the dictionary:
     - If a number's count is one, add it to the unique numbers list.
   - Return the list of unique numbers.
