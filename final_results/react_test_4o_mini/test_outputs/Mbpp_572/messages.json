After counting, we can iterate through the dictionary to collect the numbers that have a count of one. Finally, we will return this collection as a list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function `two_unique_nums` that takes a list as input.\n   - Create an empty dictionary to store the count of each number.\n   - Loop through each number in the list:\n     - If the number is already in the dictionary, increment its count.\n     - If it is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of one.\n   - Create an empty list to store the unique numbers.\n   - Loop through the dictionary:\n     - If a number's count is one, add it to the unique numbers list.\n   - Return the list of unique numbers.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(nums):\n    count_dict = {}\n    for num in nums:\n        if num in count_dict:\n            count_dict[num] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[num] = 1\n    return count_dict\n\ndef two_unique_nums(nums):\n    count_dict = count_occurrences(nums)  # Count occurrences of each number\n    unique_nums = []  # List to store unique numbers\n    for num, count in count_dict.items():  # Iterate through the count dictionary\n        if count == 1:  # Check if the count is one\n            unique_nums.append(num)  # Add to unique numbers list\n    return unique_nums  # Return the list of unique numbers\n```"
