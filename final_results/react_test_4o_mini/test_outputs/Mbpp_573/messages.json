If a number appears multiple times, it should only be counted once in the product calculation.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - Create a set from the list to automatically filter out duplicate numbers, since sets only store unique values.\n   - Initialize a variable to hold the product, starting at 1 (the multiplicative identity).\n   - Iterate through the unique numbers in the set, multiplying them together to get the final product.\n   - Return the final product.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function unique_product(numbers):\n       create a set from numbers to get unique_numbers\n       initialize product to 1\n       for each number in unique_numbers:\n           product = product * number\n       return product\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef unique_product(numbers):\n    # Create a set from the list to get unique numbers\n    unique_numbers = set(numbers)\n    \n    # Initialize the product variable to 1\n    product = 1\n    \n    # Iterate through each unique number and multiply to the product\n    for number in unique_numbers:\n        product *= number\n    \n    # Return the final product\n    return product\n```"
