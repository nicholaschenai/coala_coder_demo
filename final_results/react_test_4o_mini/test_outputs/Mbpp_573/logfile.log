You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to calculate the product of the unique numbers in a given list.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/573 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the product of all unique numbers in that list. If a number appears multiple times, it should only be counted once in the product calculation.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Create a set from the list to automatically filter out duplicate numbers, since sets only store unique values.
   - Initialize a variable to hold the product, starting at 1 (the multiplicative identity).
   - Iterate through the unique numbers in the set, multiplying them together to get the final product.
   - Return the final product.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function unique_product(numbers):
       create a set from numbers to get unique_numbers
       initialize product to 1
       for each number in unique_numbers:
           product = product * number
       return product
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def unique_product(numbers):
    # Create a set from the list to get unique numbers
    unique_numbers = set(numbers)
    
    # Initialize the product variable to 1
    product = 1
    
    # Iterate through each unique number and multiply to the product
    for number in unique_numbers:
        product *= number
    
    # Return the final product
    return product
```
