INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/629 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/629 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each number in the input list, check if it is even (a number is even if it is divisible by 2 with no remainder), and if it is, we will add it to a new list. Finally, we will return this new list containing only the even numbers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function Split(numbers):
       create an empty list called even_numbers
       for each number in numbers:
           if number is even:
               add number to even_numbers
       return even_numbers
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def Split(numbers):
    # Create an empty list to store even numbers
    even_numbers = []
    
    # Iterate through each number in the input list
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the number is even
        if number % 2 == 0:
            # If it is even, add it to the even_numbers list
            even_numbers.append(number)
    
    # Return the list of even numbers
    return even_numbers
