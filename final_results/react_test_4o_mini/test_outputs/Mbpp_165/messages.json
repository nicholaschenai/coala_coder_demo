The comparison should be case insensitive, meaning 'A' and 'a' are treated the same.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate through each character in the string.\n   - For each character, we will determine its position in the alphabet (1 for 'a' or 'A', 2 for 'b' or 'B', etc.).\n   - We will compare this position to the character's index in the string (starting from 1).\n   - If the character's position matches its index, we will increment a counter.\n   - Finally, we will return the count.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_char_position(s):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for index from 0 to length of s - 1:\n           character = s[index]\n           position = index + 1\n           if character is a letter:\n               alphabet_position = position of character in alphabet (1 for 'a', 2 for 'b', etc.)\n               if alphabet_position equals position:\n                   increment count\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef count_char_position(s: str) -> int:\n    # Initialize a counter for matching characters\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the string\n    for index in range(len(s)):\n        character = s[index].lower()  # Convert character to lowercase for case insensitivity\n        position = index + 1  # Position in the string (1-based index)\n        \n        # Check if the character is a letter\n        if 'a' <= character <= 'z':\n            # Calculate the alphabet position (1 for 'a', 2 for 'b', ..., 26 for 'z')\n            alphabet_position = ord(character) - ord('a') + 1\n            \n            # If the alphabet position matches the string position, increment the count\n            if alphabet_position == position:\n                count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of matching characters\n    return count\n```"
