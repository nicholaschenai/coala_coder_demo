You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to count the number of characters in a string that occur at the same position in the string as in the English alphabet (case insensitive).

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/165 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that counts how many characters in a given string are in the same position as their corresponding letters in the English alphabet. The comparison should be case insensitive, meaning 'A' and 'a' are treated the same.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each character in the string.
   - For each character, we will determine its position in the alphabet (1 for 'a' or 'A', 2 for 'b' or 'B', etc.).
   - We will compare this position to the character's index in the string (starting from 1).
   - If the character's position matches its index, we will increment a counter.
   - Finally, we will return the count.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_char_position(s):
       initialize count to 0
       for index from 0 to length of s - 1:
           character = s[index]
           position = index + 1
           if character is a letter:
               alphabet_position = position of character in alphabet (1 for 'a', 2 for 'b', etc.)
               if alphabet_position equals position:
                   increment count
       return count
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def count_char_position(s: str) -> int:
    # Initialize a counter for matching characters
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for index in range(len(s)):
        character = s[index].lower()  # Convert character to lowercase for case insensitivity
        position = index + 1  # Position in the string (1-based index)
        
        # Check if the character is a letter
        if 'a' <= character <= 'z':

            if alphabet_position == position:
