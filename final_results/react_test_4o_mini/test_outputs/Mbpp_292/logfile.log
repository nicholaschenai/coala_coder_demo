INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/292 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to find quotient of two numbers (rounded down to the nearest integer).
assert find(10,3) == 3

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/292 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes two numbers as input and returns the result of dividing the first number by the second number, rounded down to the nearest whole number.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the quotient of two numbers, we can use integer division. In Python, this can be done using the `//` operator, which automatically rounds down the result to the nearest integer. We will define a function that takes two parameters, performs the integer division, and returns the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Function find(a, b):
       Return a // b
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to find the quotient of two numbers
def find(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    # Use integer division to get the quotient rounded down
    return a // b
```
INFO - program_code:
