    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a tuple and an element as inputs, and then counts how many times that element appears in the tuple.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each item in the tuple and maintain a count of how many times we find the specified element. If we find a match, we increment our count. Finally, we return the count.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_X(tuple, element):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for each item in tuple:\n           if item is equal to element:\n               increment count\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function that counts occurrences of an element in a tuple\ndef count_X(tup, element):\n    # Initialize a counter to zero\n    count = 0\n    # Iterate through each item in the tuple\n    for item in tup:\n        # If the current item matches the element, increment the count\n        if item == element:\n            count += 1\n    # Return the final count\n    return count\n```",
