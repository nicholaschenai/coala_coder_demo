You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/250 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a tuple and an element as inputs, and then counts how many times that element appears in the tuple.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each item in the tuple and maintain a count of how many times we find the specified element. If we find a match, we increment our count. Finally, we return the count.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function count_X(tuple, element):
       initialize count to 0
       for each item in tuple:
           if item is equal to element:
               increment count
       return count
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function that counts occurrences of an element in a tuple
def count_X(tup, element):
    # Initialize a counter to zero
    count = 0
    # Iterate through each item in the tuple
    for item in tup:
        # If the current item matches the element, increment the count
        if item == element:
            count += 1
    # Return the final count
    return count
