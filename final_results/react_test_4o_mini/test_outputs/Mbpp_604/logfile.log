You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/604 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that takes a string of words separated by spaces and returns a new string with the order of the words reversed.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To reverse the words in a string, we can follow these steps:
   - Split the input string into a list of words using spaces as the delimiter.
   - Reverse the order of the words in the list.
   - Join the reversed list of words back into a single string with spaces in between.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   FUNCTION reverse_words(input_string):
       SPLIT input_string into a list of words
       REVERSE the list of words
       JOIN the reversed list into a single string with spaces
       RETURN the new string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def reverse_words(input_string: str) -> str:
    # Split the input string into a list of words
    words = input_string.split()
    # Reverse the list of words
    words.reverse()
    # Join the reversed list into a single string with spaces
    reversed_string = ' '.join(words)
    # Return the new string
    return reversed_string
