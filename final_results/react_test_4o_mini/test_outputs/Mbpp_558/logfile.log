You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/558 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes two integers as input and calculates the sum of the absolute differences of their corresponding digits. If the integers have different lengths, we should consider the missing digits as zeros.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - Convert both integers to strings to easily access each digit.
   - Pad the shorter string with leading zeros so that both strings have the same length.
   - Iterate through the digits of both strings, calculate the absolute difference for each pair of corresponding digits, and accumulate the sum of these differences.
   - Return the final sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function digit_distance_nums(num1, num2):
       convert num1 and num2 to strings
       find the maximum length of both strings
       pad the shorter string with leading zeros
       initialize a sum variable to 0
       for each digit in both strings:
           calculate the absolute difference
           add the difference to the sum
       return the sum
   ```
