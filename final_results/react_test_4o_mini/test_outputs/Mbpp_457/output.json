    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists (sublists) and returns the sublist that has the smallest number of elements. If there are multiple sublists with the same minimum length, we will return the first one encountered.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each sublist in the main list. We will keep track of the shortest sublist found so far by comparing the lengths of the sublists. If we find a sublist that is shorter than the current shortest, we will update our record of the shortest sublist. Finally, we will return the shortest sublist after checking all of them.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function Find_Min(sublists):\n       initialize shortest_sublist as the first sublist\n       for each sublist in sublists:\n           if length of sublist is less than length of shortest_sublist:\n               update shortest_sublist to be this sublist\n       return shortest_sublist\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef Find_Min(sublists):\n    # Initialize the shortest sublist with the first sublist\n    shortest_sublist = sublists[0]\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the provided list\n    for sublist in sublists:\n        # If the current sublist is shorter than the shortest found so far\n        if len(sublist) < len(shortest_sublist):\n            # Update the shortest sublist\n            shortest_sublist = sublist\n            \n    # Return the shortest sublist found\n    return shortest_sublist\n```",
