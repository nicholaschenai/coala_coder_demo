INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/457 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/457 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists (sublists) and returns the sublist that has the smallest number of elements. If there are multiple sublists with the same minimum length, we will return the first one encountered.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each sublist in the main list. We will keep track of the shortest sublist found so far by comparing the lengths of the sublists. If we find a sublist that is shorter than the current shortest, we will update our record of the shortest sublist. Finally, we will return the shortest sublist after checking all of them.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function Find_Min(sublists):
       initialize shortest_sublist as the first sublist
       for each sublist in sublists:
           if length of sublist is less than length of shortest_sublist:
               update shortest_sublist to be this sublist
       return shortest_sublist
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def Find_Min(sublists):
    # Initialize the shortest sublist with the first sublist
    shortest_sublist = sublists[0]
    
    # Iterate through each sublist in the provided list
    for sublist in sublists:
        # If the current sublist is shorter than the shortest found so far
        if len(sublist) < len(shortest_sublist):
            # Update the shortest sublist
            shortest_sublist = sublist
            
    # Return the shortest sublist found
    return shortest_sublist
