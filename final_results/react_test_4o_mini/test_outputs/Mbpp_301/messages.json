        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates how deep a dictionary is nested. The depth is defined as the number of levels of nested dictionaries. For example, in the dictionary `{'a':1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}`, the depth is 4 because there are four levels of nesting.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the depth of a dictionary, we can use a recursive approach. We will check each key-value pair in the dictionary. If the value is another dictionary, we will call the function recursively on that value to find its depth. We will keep track of the maximum depth found during these recursive calls and return the highest depth plus one for the current level.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function dict_depth(d):\n       if d is not a dictionary:\n           return 0\n       max_depth = 0\n       for each key-value pair in d:\n           if value is a dictionary:\n               depth = dict_depth(value)\n               if depth > max_depth:\n                   max_depth = depth\n       return max_depth + 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef dict_depth(d):\n    # Check if the input is a dictionary\n    if not isinstance(d, dict):\n        return 0  # If not, return 0 depth\n    \n    max_depth = 0  # Initialize maximum depth\n    \n    # Iterate through each key-value pair in the dictionary\n    for value in d.values():\n        if isinstance(value, dict):  # If the value is a dictionary\n            # Recursively find the depth of the nested dictionary\n            depth = dict_depth(value)\n            # Update max_depth if the found depth is greater\n            if depth > max_depth:\n                max_depth = depth\n    \n    return max_depth + 1  # Return the maximum depth found plus one for the current level\n```"
