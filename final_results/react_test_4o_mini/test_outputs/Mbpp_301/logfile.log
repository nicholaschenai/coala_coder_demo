You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/301 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates how deep a dictionary is nested. The depth is defined as the number of levels of nested dictionaries. For example, in the dictionary `{'a':1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}`, the depth is 4 because there are four levels of nesting.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the depth of a dictionary, we can use a recursive approach. We will check each key-value pair in the dictionary. If the value is another dictionary, we will call the function recursively on that value to find its depth. We will keep track of the maximum depth found during these recursive calls and return the highest depth plus one for the current level.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function dict_depth(d):
       if d is not a dictionary:
           return 0
       max_depth = 0
       for each key-value pair in d:
           if value is a dictionary:
               depth = dict_depth(value)
               if depth > max_depth:
                   max_depth = depth
       return max_depth + 1
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def dict_depth(d):
