    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a string and a character as input. The function should remove the first and last occurrence of that character from the string and return the modified string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - Find the index of the first occurrence of the specified character in the string.\n   - Find the index of the last occurrence of the specified character in the string.\n   - If both occurrences are found, create a new string that excludes these two characters.\n   - If the character does not occur in the string, return the string unchanged.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function remove_Occ(string, char):\n       first_index = find index of char in string\n       last_index = find last index of char in string\n       \n       if first_index is not -1 and last_index is not -1:\n           new_string = string without character at first_index and last_index\n           return new_string\n       else:\n           return string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef remove_Occ(string: str, char: str) -> str:\n    # Find the index of the first occurrence of the character\n    first_index = string.find(char)\n    # Find the index of the last occurrence of the character\n    last_index = string.rfind(char)\n    \n    # Check if both occurrences are found\n    if first_index != -1 and last_index != -1:\n        # Create a new string excluding the first and last occurrence\n        new_string = string[:first_index] + string[first_index + 1:last_index] + string[last_index + 1:]\n        return new_string\n    else:\n        # If the character is not found, return the original string\n        return string\n```",
