You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/11 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string and a character as input. The function should remove the first and last occurrence of that character from the string and return the modified string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Find the index of the first occurrence of the specified character in the string.
   - Find the index of the last occurrence of the specified character in the string.
   - If both occurrences are found, create a new string that excludes these two characters.
   - If the character does not occur in the string, return the string unchanged.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function remove_Occ(string, char):
       first_index = find index of char in string
       last_index = find last index of char in string
       
       if first_index is not -1 and last_index is not -1:
           new_string = string without character at first_index and last_index
           return new_string
       else:
           return string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:

def remove_Occ(string: str, char: str) -> str:
    # Find the index of the first occurrence of the character
    first_index = string.find(char)
    # Find the index of the last occurrence of the character
    last_index = string.rfind(char)
    
    # Check if both occurrences are found
    if first_index != -1 and last_index != -1:
        # Create a new string excluding the first and last occurrence
        new_string = string[:first_index] + string[first_index + 1:last_index] + string[last_index + 1:]
        return new_string
    else:
        # If the character is not found, return the original string
