You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/95 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the smallest list contained within that list of lists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each list in the main list, check the length of each sublist, and keep track of the smallest length we encounter. At the end of the iteration, we will return the smallest length found.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function `Find_Min_Length` that takes a parameter `lists`.
   - Initialize a variable `min_length` to a large number (like infinity).
   - Loop through each sublist in `lists`:
     - Get the length of the current sublist.
     - If this length is smaller than `min_length`, update `min_length`.
   - After the loop, return `min_length`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def Find_Min_Length(lists):
    # Initialize min_length to a large number
    min_length = float('inf')
    
    # Iterate through each sublist in the list of lists
    for sublist in lists:
        # Get the length of the current sublist
        current_length = len(sublist)
        
        # Update min_length if the current length is smaller
        if current_length < min_length:
            min_length = current_length
            
    # Return the smallest length found
    return min_length
