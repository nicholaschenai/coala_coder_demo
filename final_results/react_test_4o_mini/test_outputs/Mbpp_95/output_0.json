    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the smallest list contained within that list of lists.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each list in the main list, check the length of each sublist, and keep track of the smallest length we encounter. At the end of the iteration, we will return the smallest length found.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function `Find_Min_Length` that takes a parameter `lists`.\n   - Initialize a variable `min_length` to a large number (like infinity).\n   - Loop through each sublist in `lists`:\n     - Get the length of the current sublist.\n     - If this length is smaller than `min_length`, update `min_length`.\n   - After the loop, return `min_length`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef Find_Min_Length(lists):\n    # Initialize min_length to a large number\n    min_length = float('inf')\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the list of lists\n    for sublist in lists:\n        # Get the length of the current sublist\n        current_length = len(sublist)\n        \n        # Update min_length if the current length is smaller\n        if current_length < min_length:\n            min_length = current_length\n            \n    # Return the smallest length found\n    return min_length\n```",
