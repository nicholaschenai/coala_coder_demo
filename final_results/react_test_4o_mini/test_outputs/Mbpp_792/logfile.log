INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/792 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to count the number of lists in a given number of lists.
assert count_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [9, 11], [13, 15, 17]]) == 4

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/792 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the total number of lists contained within that input list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can simply use the built-in `len()` function in Python, which counts the number of elements in a list. Since the input is a list of lists, calling `len()` on the input will give us the count of the inner lists.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION count_list(input_lists):
       RETURN the length of input_lists
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function that takes a list of lists as input
def count_list(input_lists):
    # Use the built-in len() function to count the number of lists
    return len(input_lists)  # Return the count of lists
