INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/405 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to check whether an element exists within a tuple.
assert check_tuplex(("w", 3, "r", "e", "s", "o", "u", "r", "c", "e"),'r')==True

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/405 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a specific element is present in a given tuple. The function should return `True` if the element exists in the tuple and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use the `in` keyword in Python, which allows us to check for the presence of an element in a collection like a tuple. We will define a function that takes a tuple and an element as inputs, and then we will return the result of the membership test.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION check_tuplex(tuple, element):
       RETURN element IN tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to check if an element exists in a tuple
def check_tuplex(tup, elem):
    # Use the 'in' keyword to check for the presence of the element in the tuple
    return elem in tup
```
