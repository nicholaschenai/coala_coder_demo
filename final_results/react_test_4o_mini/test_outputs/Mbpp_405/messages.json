We will define a function that takes a tuple and an element as inputs, and then we will return the result of the membership test.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION check_tuplex(tuple, element):\n       RETURN element IN tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to check if an element exists in a tuple\ndef check_tuplex(tup, elem):\n    # Use the 'in' keyword to check for the presence of the element in the tuple\n    return elem in tup\n```"
