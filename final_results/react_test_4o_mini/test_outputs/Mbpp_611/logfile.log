You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/611 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a matrix (which is a list of lists) and an integer `n`, and returns the maximum value found in the `n`th column of that matrix.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum value found in the specified column.
   - Loop through each row of the matrix and access the `n`th element of each row.
   - Compare this element with the current maximum value and update the maximum if the current element is greater.
   - Finally, return the maximum value found.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_of_nth(matrix, n):
       initialize max_value to a very small number
       for each row in matrix:
           if the row has at least n+1 elements:
               current_value = row[n]
               if current_value > max_value:
                   max_value = current_value
       return max_value
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def max_of_nth(matrix, n):
    # Initialize max_value to a very small number
    max_value = float('-inf')
    
    # Loop through each row in the matrix
    for row in matrix:
        # Check if the row has at least n+1 elements
        if len(row) > n:
            # Get the current value from the nth column
            current_value = row[n]
            # Update max_value if current_value is greater
            if current_value > max_value:
                max_value = current_value
    
    # Return the maximum value found in the nth column
    return max_value
