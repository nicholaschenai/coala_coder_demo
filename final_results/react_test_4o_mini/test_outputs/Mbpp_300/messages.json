        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that counts how many binary sequences of length `2n` exist such that the sum of the first half of the sequence (the first `n` bits) is equal to the sum of the second half (the last `n` bits).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can use combinatorial mathematics. The key observation is that for a binary sequence of length `2n`, the sum of the first `n` bits can range from `0` to `n`. For each possible sum `k` (where `k` is the number of `1`s in the first half), we need to find the number of ways to choose `k` `1`s from `n` bits in both halves. The total number of valid sequences will be the sum of the squares of the binomial coefficients for each possible sum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_binary_seq(n):\n       total_count = 0\n       for k from 0 to n:\n           count_k = binomial_coefficient(n, k)\n           total_count += count_k * count_k\n       return total_count\n       \n   function binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n       if k > n or k < 0:\n           return 0\n       result = 1\n       for i from 0 to k-1:\n           result *= (n - i)\n           result /= (i + 1)\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n    # Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k)\n    if k > n or k < 0:\n        return 0\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(k):\n        result *= (n - i)\n        result //= (i + 1)  # Use integer division\n    return result\n\ndef count_binary_seq(n: int) -> float:\n    # Initialize total count of valid binary sequences\n    total_count = 0\n    # Iterate over all possible sums of the first half\n    for k in range(n + 1):\n        # Calculate the number of ways to choose k 1's from n bits\n        count_k = binomial_coefficient(n, k)\n        # Add the square of count_k to total_count\n        total_count += count_k * count_k\n    # Return the total count as a float\n    return float(total_count)\n```"
