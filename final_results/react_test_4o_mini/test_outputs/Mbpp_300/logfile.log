You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/300 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that counts how many binary sequences of length `2n` exist such that the sum of the first half of the sequence (the first `n` bits) is equal to the sum of the second half (the last `n` bits).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use combinatorial mathematics. The key observation is that for a binary sequence of length `2n`, the sum of the first `n` bits can range from `0` to `n`. For each possible sum `k` (where `k` is the number of `1`s in the first half), we need to find the number of ways to choose `k` `1`s from `n` bits in both halves. The total number of valid sequences will be the sum of the squares of the binomial coefficients for each possible sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_binary_seq(n):
       total_count = 0
       for k from 0 to n:
           count_k = binomial_coefficient(n, k)
           total_count += count_k * count_k
       return total_count
       
   function binomial_coefficient(n, k):
       if k > n or k < 0:
           return 0
       result = 1
       for i from 0 to k-1:
           result *= (n - i)
           result /= (i + 1)
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
    # Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k)
    if k > n or k < 0:
        return 0
    result = 1
    for i in range(k):
        result *= (n - i)
        result //= (i + 1)  # Use integer division
    return result
