You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function which takes a list of integers and only returns the odd ones.
assert Split([1,2,3,4,5,6]) == [1,3,5]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/554 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each integer in the input list. For each integer, we will check if it is odd (an integer is odd if it is not divisible by 2). If it is odd, we will add it to a new list. Finally, we will return this new list containing only the odd integers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function Split(input_list):
       create an empty list called odd_numbers
       for each number in input_list:
           if number is odd:
               add number to odd_numbers
       return odd_numbers
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def Split(input_list):
    # Create an empty list to store odd numbers
    odd_numbers = []
    
    # Iterate through each number in the input list
    for number in input_list:
        # Check if the number is odd
        if number % 2 != 0:
            # If it is odd, add it to the odd_numbers list
            odd_numbers.append(number)
    
    # Return the list of odd numbers
    return odd_numbers
