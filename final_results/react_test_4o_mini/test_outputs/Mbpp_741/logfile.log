INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/741 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/741 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if all the characters in a given string are the same. If they are the same, the function should return `True`, and if they are not, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can take the following steps:
   - Check if the string is empty. If it is, we can return `True` since there are no differing characters.
   - Take the first character of the string and compare it with every other character in the string.
   - If we find any character that is different from the first character, we return `False`.
   - If we finish checking all characters and they are all the same, we return `True`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function all_Characters_Same(string):
       if string is empty:
           return True
       first_character = string[0]
       for each character in string:
           if character is not equal to first_character:
               return False
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def all_Characters_Same(string: str) -> bool:
    # Check if the string is empty
    if not string:
        return True  # An empty string is considered to have all same characters
    # Get the first character of the string
    first_character = string[0]
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for character in string:
        # If any character is different from the first one, return False
        if character != first_character:
            return False
    # If all characters are the same, return True
    return True
```
