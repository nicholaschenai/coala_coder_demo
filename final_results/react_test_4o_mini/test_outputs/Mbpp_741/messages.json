If it is, we can return `True` since there are no differing characters.\n   - Take the first character of the string and compare it with every other character in the string.\n   - If we find any character that is different from the first character, we return `False`.\n   - If we finish checking all characters and they are all the same, we return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function all_Characters_Same(string):\n       if string is empty:\n           return True\n       first_character = string[0]\n       for each character in string:\n           if character is not equal to first_character:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef all_Characters_Same(string: str) -> bool:\n    # Check if the string is empty\n    if not string:\n        return True  # An empty string is considered to have all same characters\n    # Get the first character of the string\n    first_character = string[0]\n    # Iterate through each character in the string\n    for character in string:\n        # If any character is different from the first one, return False\n        if character != first_character:\n            return False\n    # If all characters are the same, return True\n    return True\n```"
