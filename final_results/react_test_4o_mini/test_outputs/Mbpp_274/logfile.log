You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/274 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that takes a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices from the expansion of `(1 + 1)^n`. The result should be the sum of these coefficients.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   The binomial coefficients can be calculated using the formula for combinations, specifically `C(n, k)`, which represents the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements. The even index coefficients are those where `k` is even (0, 2, 4, ...). To find the sum of these coefficients, we will iterate through all even indices up to `n` and sum the values of `C(n, k)` for those indices.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n):
       initialize sum to 0
       for k from 0 to n:
           if k is even:
               calculate C(n, k) using the formula n! / (k! * (n - k)!)
               add C(n, k) to sum
       return sum
   ```
