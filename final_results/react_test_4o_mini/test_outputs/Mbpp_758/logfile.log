You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

Write a function to count lists within a list. The function should return a dictionary where every list is converted to a tuple and the value of such tuple is the number of its occurencies in the original list.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/758 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists as input. The function should count how many times each unique sublist appears in the input list and return this information in the form of a dictionary. In the dictionary, each unique sublist should be represented as a tuple, and the value should be the count of occurrences of that sublist.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will create an empty dictionary to store the counts of each unique sublist.
   - We will iterate through each sublist in the input list.
   - For each sublist, we will convert it to a tuple (since lists are not hashable and cannot be used as dictionary keys).
   - We will check if this tuple is already a key in our dictionary:
     - If it is, we will increment its count.
     - If it is not, we will add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.
   - Finally, we will return the dictionary containing the counts of each unique sublist.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function unique_sublists(input_list):
       create an empty dictionary called count_dict
       for each sublist in input_list:
           convert sublist to a tuple
           if tuple is in count_dict:
               increment count_dict[tuple] by 1
           else:
               set count_dict[tuple] to 1
       return count_dict
   ```
