You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/762 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given month (represented by a number from 1 to 12) has 30 days. The function should return `True` if the month has 30 days and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   We can create a list or a set of month numbers that have 30 days. The months that have 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). We will check if the input month number is in this list. If it is, we return `True`; if not, we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Define a function check_monthnumber_number(month: int) -> bool:
       Create a list of months with 30 days: [4, 6, 9, 11]
       If month is in the list:
           Return True
       Else:
           Return False
   ```
