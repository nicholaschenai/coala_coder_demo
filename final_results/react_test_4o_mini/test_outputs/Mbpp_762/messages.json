The months that have 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). We will check if the input month number is in this list. If it is, we return `True`; if not, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Define a function check_monthnumber_number(month: int) -> bool:\n       Create a list of months with 30 days: [4, 6, 9, 11]\n       If month is in the list:\n           Return True\n       Else:\n           Return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to check if a month has 30 days\ndef check_monthnumber_number(month: int) -> bool:\n    # List of months that have 30 days\n    months_with_30_days = [4, 6, 9, 11]\n    # Check if the given month is in the list\n    if month in months_with_30_days:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```"
