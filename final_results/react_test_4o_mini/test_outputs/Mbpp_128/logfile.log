INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/128 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/128 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a number `n` and a string of words. The function should return a list of words from that string that are longer than `n` characters.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - First, we will split the input string into individual words.
   - Then, we will check the length of each word.
   - If a word's length is greater than `n`, we will add it to a new list.
   - Finally, we will return the list of words that are longer than `n` characters.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function long_words(n, words_string):
       split the words_string into a list of words
       create an empty list to hold long words
       for each word in the list of words:
           if the length of the word is greater than n:
               add the word to the list of long words
       return the list of long words
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:

def long_words(n: int, words_string: str) -> list:
    # Split the input string into a list of words

    # Iterate through each word in the list

        # Check if the length of the word is greater than n
        if len(word) > n:
            # Add the word to the list of long words
            long_words_list.append(word)
    # Return the list of long words
