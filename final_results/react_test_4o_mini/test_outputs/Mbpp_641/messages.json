A nonagonal number is a figurate number that represents a nonagon (a nine-sided polygon). The formula to find the nth nonagonal number is given by the formula: \\( P(n) = \\frac{n(7n - 5)}{2} \\).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the nth nonagonal number, we will use the formula mentioned above.
