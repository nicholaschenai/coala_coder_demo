You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/641 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the nth nonagonal number. A nonagonal number is a figurate number that represents a nonagon (a nine-sided polygon). The formula to find the nth nonagonal number is given by the formula: \( P(n) = \frac{n(7n - 5)}{2} \).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the nth nonagonal number, we will use the formula mentioned above. We will take the input n, apply the formula, and return the result. The function will be straightforward since it only involves basic arithmetic operations.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION is_nonagonal(n):
       IF n is less than 1:
           RETURN an error or invalid value
       nonagonal_number = (n * (7 * n - 5)) / 2
       RETURN nonagonal_number
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def is_nonagonal(n):
    # Check if n is a valid input (greater than 0)
    if n < 1:
        return None  # or raise an error for invalid input
    # Calculate the nth nonagonal number using the formula
    nonagonal_number = (n * (7 * n - 5)) // 2  # Use integer division
    return nonagonal_number  # Return the result
```
