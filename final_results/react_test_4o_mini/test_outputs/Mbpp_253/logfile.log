INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/253 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list.
assert count_integer([1,2,'abc',1.2]) == 2

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/253 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list as input and counts how many of the elements in that list are integers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each element in the list and check if it is an integer. We can maintain a counter that increments each time we find an integer. Finally, we will return the count.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function count_integer(input_list):
       initialize count to 0
       for each element in input_list:
           if element is an integer:
               increment count
       return count
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a helper function to check if an element is an integer
def is_integer(element):
    return type(element) is int

# Main function to count integer elements in the list
def count_integer(input_list):
    count = 0  # Initialize the count of integers
    for element in input_list:  # Iterate through each element in the list
        if is_integer(element):  # Check if the element is an integer
            count += 1  # Increment the count if it is an integer
    return count  # Return the final count of integers
