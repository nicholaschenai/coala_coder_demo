You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/6 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if two given integers differ by exactly one bit in their binary representation. If they do, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if two numbers differ by one bit, we can use the XOR operation. The XOR of two numbers will yield a binary number where each bit is set to `1` if the corresponding bits of the two numbers are different. If the result of the XOR operation has exactly one bit set to `1`, it means the two numbers differ by exactly one bit.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function `differ_At_One_Bit_Pos` that takes two integers as input.
   - Calculate the XOR of the two integers.
   - Count the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the XOR result.
   - If the count of `1`s is exactly one, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def count_set_bits(n):
    count = 0
    while n > 0:
        count += n & 1  # Increment count if the last bit is 1
        n >>= 1         # Right shift n to check the next bit
    return count

def differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(a: int, b: int) -> bool:
    xor_result = a ^ b  # Perform XOR operation
    return count_set_bits(xor_result) == 1  # Check if exactly one bit is set
