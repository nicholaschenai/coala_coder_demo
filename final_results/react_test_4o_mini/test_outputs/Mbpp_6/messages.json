If they do, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if two numbers differ by one bit, we can use the XOR operation. The XOR of two numbers will yield a binary number where each bit is set to `1` if the corresponding bits of the two numbers are different. If the result of the XOR operation has exactly one bit set to `1`, it means the two numbers differ by exactly one bit.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function `differ_At_One_Bit_Pos` that takes two integers as input.\n   - Calculate the XOR of the two integers.\n   - Count the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the XOR result.\n   - If the count of `1`s is exactly one, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef count_set_bits(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        count += n & 1  # Increment count if the last bit is 1\n        n >>= 1         # Right shift n to check the next bit\n    return count\n\ndef differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(a: int, b: int) -> bool:\n    xor_result = a ^ b  # Perform XOR operation\n    return count_set_bits(xor_result) == 1  # Check if exactly one bit is set\n```"
