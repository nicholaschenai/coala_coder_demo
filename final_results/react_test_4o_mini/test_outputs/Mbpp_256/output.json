    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a non-negative integer as input and returns the count of all prime numbers that are less than that integer.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through all numbers from 2 up to (but not including) the given number. For each number, we will check if it is prime. A prime number is defined as a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. We will maintain a count of how many prime numbers we find and return that count at the end.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_Primes_nums(n):\n       if n <= 2:\n           return 0\n       initialize count to 0\n       for each number i from 2 to n-1:\n           if is_prime(i):\n               increment count\n       return count\n\n   function is_prime(num):\n       if num <= 1:\n           return False\n       for each number j from 2 to sqrt(num):\n           if num is divisible by j:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef is_prime(num):\n    # Check if the number is less than or equal to 1\n    if num <= 1:\n        return False\n    # Check for factors from 2 to the square root of num\n    for j in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):\n        if num % j == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef count_Primes_nums(n: int) -> int:\n    # If n is less than or equal to 2, there are no primes less than n\n    if n <= 2:\n        return 0\n    count = 0\n    # Iterate through all numbers from 2 to n-1\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        if is_prime(i):\n            count += 1  # Increment count if i is prime\n    return count  # Return the total count of prime numbers\n```",
