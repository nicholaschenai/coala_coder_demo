INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/256 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/256 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a non-negative integer as input and returns the count of all prime numbers that are less than that integer.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through all numbers from 2 up to (but not including) the given number. For each number, we will check if it is prime. A prime number is defined as a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. We will maintain a count of how many prime numbers we find and return that count at the end.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function count_Primes_nums(n):
       if n <= 2:
           return 0
       initialize count to 0
       for each number i from 2 to n-1:
           if is_prime(i):
               increment count
       return count

   function is_prime(num):
       if num <= 1:
           return False
       for each number j from 2 to sqrt(num):
           if num is divisible by j:
               return False
       return True
   ```
