The function should sort these tuples based on the score (the second element of each tuple) in ascending order and return the sorted list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can use the built-in sorting capabilities of Python. We will define a function that takes the list of tuples as input. We will then sort the list using a key that specifies we want to sort by the second element of each tuple. Finally, we will return the sorted list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define a function subject_marks that takes a list of tuples as input\n   Use the sort method on the list with a key that extracts the second element of each tuple\n   Return the sorted list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef subject_marks(marks):\n    # Sort the list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple\n    marks.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])\n    # Return the sorted list\n    return marks\n```"
