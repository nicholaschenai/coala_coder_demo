You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/64 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a subject name and a corresponding score. The function should sort these tuples based on the score (the second element of each tuple) in ascending order and return the sorted list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use the built-in sorting capabilities of Python. We will define a function that takes the list of tuples as input. We will then sort the list using a key that specifies we want to sort by the second element of each tuple. Finally, we will return the sorted list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define a function subject_marks that takes a list of tuples as input
   Use the sort method on the list with a key that extracts the second element of each tuple
   Return the sorted list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def subject_marks(marks):
    # Sort the list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple
    marks.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    # Return the sorted list
    return marks
```
