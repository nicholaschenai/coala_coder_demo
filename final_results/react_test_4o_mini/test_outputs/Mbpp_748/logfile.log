INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/748 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to put spaces between words starting with capital letters in a given string.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/748 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and adds spaces between words that start with capital letters. For example, if the input is "HelloWorld", the output should be "Hello World".

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   We can iterate through each character in the string. Whenever we encounter a capital letter (except for the first character), we will insert a space before it. This way, we can separate the words that start with capital letters.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Initialize an empty result string.
   - Loop through each character in the input string.
   - If the character is uppercase and it is not the first character, append a space to the result string before appending the character.
   - If it is the first character or not uppercase, just append the character to the result string.
   - Return the result string.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def capital_words_spaces(s: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty result string
    result = ""
    
    # Loop through each character in the input string
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # If the character is uppercase and it's not the first character
        if s[i].isupper() and i != 0:
            # Append a space before appending the character
            result += " "
        # Append the character to the result string
        result += s[i]
    
    # Return the result string
    return result
