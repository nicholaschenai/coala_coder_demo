For example, if the input is \"HelloWorld\", the output should be \"Hello World\".\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We can iterate through each character in the string. Whenever we encounter a capital letter (except for the first character), we will insert a space before it. This way, we can separate the words that start with capital letters.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Initialize an empty result string.\n   - Loop through each character in the input string.\n   - If the character is uppercase and it is not the first character, append a space to the result string before appending the character.\n   - If it is the first character or not uppercase, just append the character to the result string.\n   - Return the result string.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:\n```python\ndef capital_words_spaces(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty result string\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Loop through each character in the input string\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # If the character is uppercase and it's not the first character\n        if s[i].isupper() and i != 0:\n            # Append a space before appending the character\n            result += \" \"\n        # Append the character to the result string\n        result += s[i]\n    \n    # Return the result string\n    return result\n```"
