    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a string formatted in snake case (where words are separated by underscores) and converts it into camel case (where the first letter of each word is capitalized and there are no spaces or underscores).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To convert a snake case string to camel case, we can follow these steps:\n   - Split the input string by underscores to get individual words.\n   - Capitalize the first letter of each word.\n   - Join all the capitalized words together without any spaces or underscores.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function snake_to_camel(snake_str):\n       split the snake_str by underscores into a list of words\n       create an empty list to hold the capitalized words\n       for each word in the list:\n           capitalize the word and add it to the list of capitalized words\n       join the list of capitalized words into a single string\n       return the resulting string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef snake_to_camel(snake_str: str) -> str:\n    # Split the input string by underscores to get individual words\n    words = snake_str.split('_')\n    \n    # Create an empty list to hold the capitalized words\n    capitalized_words = []\n    \n    # Capitalize the first letter of each word and add to the list\n    for word in words:\n        capitalized_words.append(word.capitalize())\n    \n    # Join the list of capitalized words into a single string\n    camel_case_str = ''.join(capitalized_words)\n    \n    # Return the resulting camel case string\n    return camel_case_str\n```",
