You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/102 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string formatted in snake case (where words are separated by underscores) and converts it into camel case (where the first letter of each word is capitalized and there are no spaces or underscores).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To convert a snake case string to camel case, we can follow these steps:
   - Split the input string by underscores to get individual words.
   - Capitalize the first letter of each word.
   - Join all the capitalized words together without any spaces or underscores.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function snake_to_camel(snake_str):
       split the snake_str by underscores into a list of words
       create an empty list to hold the capitalized words
       for each word in the list:
           capitalize the word and add it to the list of capitalized words
       join the list of capitalized words into a single string
       return the resulting string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def snake_to_camel(snake_str: str) -> str:
    # Split the input string by underscores to get individual words
    words = snake_str.split('_')
    
    # Create an empty list to hold the capitalized words
    capitalized_words = []
    
    # Capitalize the first letter of each word and add to the list
    for word in words:
        capitalized_words.append(word.capitalize())
    
    # Join the list of capitalized words into a single string
    camel_case_str = ''.join(capitalized_words)
    
    # Return the resulting camel case string
    return camel_case_str
