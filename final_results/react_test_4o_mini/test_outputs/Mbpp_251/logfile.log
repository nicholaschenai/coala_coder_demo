You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function that takes in a list and an element and inserts the element before each element in the list, and returns the resulting list.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/251 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of elements and a single element. The function should insert the given element before each element in the list and return the new list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can create a new list that will hold the result. We will iterate through each element in the input list, and for each element, we will first add the specified element to the new list, followed by the current element from the input list. Finally, we will return the new list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function insert_element(input_list, element):
       create an empty list called result
       for each item in input_list:
           append element to result
           append item to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def insert_element(input_list, element):
    # Create an empty list to hold the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through each item in the input list
    for item in input_list:
        # Append the specified element to the result list
        result.append(element)
        # Append the current item from the input list to the result list
        result.append(item)
    
    # Return the resulting list
    return result
