You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/8 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing the squares of each of those numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each number in the input list, calculate its square by multiplying the number by itself, and then store the result in a new list. Finally, we will return this new list containing all the squared values.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Function square_nums(input_list):
       Create an empty list called squared_list
       For each number in input_list:
           Calculate the square of the number
           Append the square to squared_list
       Return squared_list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def square_nums(input_list):
    # Create an empty list to store the squared numbers
    squared_list = []
    
    # Iterate through each number in the input list
    for number in input_list:
        # Calculate the square of the number
        square = number * number
        
        # Append the square to the squared_list
        squared_list.append(square)
    
    # Return the list of squared numbers
