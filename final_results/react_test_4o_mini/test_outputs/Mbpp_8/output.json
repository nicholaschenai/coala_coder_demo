    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The task is to create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing the squares of each of those numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each number in the input list, calculate its square by multiplying the number by itself, and then store the result in a new list. Finally, we will return this new list containing all the squared values.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Function square_nums(input_list):\n       Create an empty list called squared_list\n       For each number in input_list:\n           Calculate the square of the number\n           Append the square to squared_list\n       Return squared_list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef square_nums(input_list):\n    # Create an empty list to store the squared numbers\n    squared_list = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the input list\n    for number in input_list:\n        # Calculate the square of the number\n        square = number * number\n        \n        # Append the square to the squared_list\n        squared_list.append(square)\n    \n    # Return the list of squared numbers\n    return squared_list\n```",
