In the provided example, the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`. The non-repeated elements in this list are `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`. Their sum is `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20`, which is why the output of the function is `20`.\n\n2. **Identifying the Mistake**: The assertion states that the expected output for the input list should be `21`. This indicates that I misunderstood the requirement. The sum of non-repeated elements should include all elements that appear only once, but I need to ensure that I am correctly identifying which elements are non-repeated.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong**: In my previous solution, I correctly counted the occurrences of each number, but I mistakenly assumed that the sum of all numbers in the list minus the repeated ones would yield the correct result. Instead, I should have focused solely on summing the numbers that appear exactly once.\n\n4. **Correcting the Approach**: \n   - I need to ensure that I correctly identify the non-repeated elements and sum them.\n   - I will iterate through the list to count occurrences and then sum only those elements that have a count of one.\n\nNow, I will revise the code to ensure it correctly sums only the non-repeated elements. \n\nHere\u2019s the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum(numbers):\n    # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each number\n    count_dict = {}\n    \n    # Count each number's occurrences\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number in count_dict:\n            count_dict[number] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[number] = 1\n    \n    # Initialize sum of non-repeated elements\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Sum the numbers that appear only once\n    for number, count in count_dict.items():\n        if count == 1:\n            total_sum += number\n    \n    # Return the final sum\n    return total_sum\n``` \n\nThis code correctly counts the occurrences and sums only those numbers that appear exactly once.
