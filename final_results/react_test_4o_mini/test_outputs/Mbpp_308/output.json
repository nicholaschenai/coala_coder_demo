    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes two lists of numbers and finds the largest products that can be formed by multiplying one number from the first list with one number from the second list. The function should return the specified number of largest products in a list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate through each number in the first list and multiply it with each number in the second list to calculate all possible products.\n   - We will store these products in a list.\n   - After calculating all products, we will sort this list in descending order to find the largest products.\n   - Finally, we will return the specified number of largest products from the sorted list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function large_product(list1, list2, n):\n       create an empty list for products\n       for each number in list1:\n           for each number in list2:\n               calculate the product of the two numbers\n               add the product to the products list\n       sort the products list in descending order\n       return the first n elements of the sorted products list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef large_product(list1, list2, n):\n    # Create an empty list to store the products\n    products = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the first list\n    for num1 in list1:\n        # Iterate through each number in the second list\n        for num2 in list2:\n            # Calculate the product of the two numbers\n            product = num1 * num2\n            # Add the product to the products list\n            products.append(product)\n    \n    # Sort the products list in descending order\n    products.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Return the first n elements of the sorted products list\n    return products[:n]\n```",
