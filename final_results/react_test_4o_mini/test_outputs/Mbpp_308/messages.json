The function should return the specified number of largest products in a list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate through each number in the first list and multiply it with each number in the second list to calculate all possible products.\n   - We will store these products in a list.\n   - After calculating all products, we will sort this list in descending order to find the largest products.\n   - Finally, we will return the specified number of largest products from the sorted list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function large_product(list1, list2, n):\n       create an empty list for products\n       for each number in list1:\n           for each number in list2:\n               calculate the product of the two numbers\n               add the product to the products list\n       sort the products list in descending order\n       return the first n elements of the sorted products list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef large_product(list1, list2, n):\n    # Create an empty list to store the products\n    products = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the first list\n    for num1 in list1:\n        # Iterate through each number in the second list\n        for num2 in list2:\n            # Calculate the product of the two numbers\n            product = num1 * num2\n            # Add the product to the products list\n            products.append(product)\n    \n    # Sort the products list in descending order\n    products.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Return the first n elements of the sorted products list\n    return products[:n]\n```"
