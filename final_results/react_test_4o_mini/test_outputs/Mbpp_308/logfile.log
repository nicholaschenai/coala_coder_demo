You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/308 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes two lists of numbers and finds the largest products that can be formed by multiplying one number from the first list with one number from the second list. The function should return the specified number of largest products in a list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each number in the first list and multiply it with each number in the second list to calculate all possible products.
   - We will store these products in a list.
   - After calculating all products, we will sort this list in descending order to find the largest products.
   - Finally, we will return the specified number of largest products from the sorted list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function large_product(list1, list2, n):
       create an empty list for products
       for each number in list1:
           for each number in list2:
               calculate the product of the two numbers
               add the product to the products list
       sort the products list in descending order
       return the first n elements of the sorted products list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def large_product(list1, list2, n):
    # Create an empty list to store the products
    products = []
    
    # Iterate through each number in the first list
    for num1 in list1:

        for num2 in list2:
            # Calculate the product of the two numbers
            product = num1 * num2
            # Add the product to the products list
            products.append(product)
    
    # Sort the products list in descending order
    products.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Return the first n elements of the sorted products list
    return products[:n]
