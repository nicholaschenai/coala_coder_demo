    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes three integers as input and counts how many of those integers are equal to each other. If all three integers are the same, the function should return 3. If two are the same and one is different, it should return 2. If all three are different, it should return 0.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We can compare the three integers using simple conditional statements. We will check:\n   - If all three integers are equal, return 3.\n   - If two integers are equal and one is different, return 2.\n   - If all three integers are different, return 0.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function test_three_equal(a, b, c):\n       if a == b and b == c:\n           return 3\n       else if a == b or a == c or b == c:\n           return 2\n       else:\n           return 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to count equal numbers among three integers\ndef test_three_equal(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:\n    # Check if all three numbers are equal\n    if a == b and b == c:\n        return 3  # All three are equal\n    # Check if any two numbers are equal\n    elif a == b or a == c or b == c:\n        return 2  # Two are equal\n    else:\n        return 0  # All three are different\n```",
