You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to count the number of equal numbers from three given integers.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/801 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes three integers as input and counts how many of those integers are equal to each other. If all three integers are the same, the function should return 3. If two are the same and one is different, it should return 2. If all three are different, it should return 0.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   We can compare the three integers using simple conditional statements. We will check:
   - If all three integers are equal, return 3.
   - If two integers are equal and one is different, return 2.
   - If all three integers are different, return 0.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function test_three_equal(a, b, c):
       if a == b and b == c:
           return 3
       else if a == b or a == c or b == c:
           return 2
       else:
           return 0
   ```

    # Check if any two numbers are equal
