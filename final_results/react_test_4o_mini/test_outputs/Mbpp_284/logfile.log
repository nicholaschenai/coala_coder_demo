You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
assert check_element(["green", "orange", "black", "white"],'blue')==False

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/284 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if all elements in a given list are equal to a specified element. If they are all equal, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each item in the list and compare it to the specified element. If we find any item that is not equal to the specified element, we can immediately return `False`. If we finish checking all items and they are all equal to the specified element, we return `True`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION check_element(list, element):
       FOR each item in list:
           IF item is not equal to element:
               RETURN False
       RETURN True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:

# Define a function that checks if all items in the list are equal to the given element
def check_element(lst, element):
    # Iterate through each item in the list
    for item in lst:
        # If any item is not equal to the specified element, return False

            return False
    # If all items are equal to the specified element, return True
