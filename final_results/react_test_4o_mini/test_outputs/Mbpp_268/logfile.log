INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/268 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the n-th star number. The star numbers are a specific sequence of numbers, and for this problem, we know that the third star number is 37.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the n-th star number, we need to understand the formula or method to generate star numbers. Star numbers can be calculated using the formula:

## Instructions

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/268 [generation text] Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find the n-th star number, and we know that for n=3, the expected output is 37. 

2. **Reviewing the Formula**: The formula I initially used was:
   \[
   S(n) = n(6n - 6 + 1) / 2
   \]
   However, this formula seems incorrect based on the output I received (19 instead of 37). 

3. **Identifying the Mistake**: The formula I used does not correctly represent the sequence of star numbers. I need to find the correct formula or method to compute the n-th star number.

4. **Researching Star Numbers**: Star numbers can be defined recursively or through a specific formula. The correct formula for the n-th star number is:
   \[
   S(n) = n(2n - 1)
   \]
   This means that the n-th star number is calculated by multiplying n by (2n - 1).

5. **Conclusion**: The mistake was in using the wrong formula for calculating star numbers. I need to implement the correct formula in the function.

Now, I will write the corrected code using the right formula for star numbers. 

```python
def find_star_num(n):
    # Calculate the n-th star number using the correct formula
    return n * (2 * n - 1)  # This gives the correct star number

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/268 [prompt] Let's analyze the situation step-by-step again:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the n-th star number, and we know that for n=3, the expected output is 37.

2. **Reviewing the Latest Formula**: The formula I used in the last attempt was:
   \[
   S(n) = n(2n - 1)
   \]
   However, this produced an output of 15 for n=3, which is incorrect.

3. **Identifying the Mistake**: The formula I used does not correspond to the correct sequence of star numbers. I need to find the correct formula or method to compute the n-th star number.

4. **Researching Star Numbers Again**: Star numbers are defined as:
   \[
   S(n) = \frac{n(6n - 6 + 1)}{2}
   \]
   This formula is incorrect as well. The correct formula for the n-th star number is:
   \[
   S(n) = \frac{n(2n - 1)(2n - 3)}{3}
   \]
   This formula generates the correct sequence of star numbers.

5. **Conclusion**: The mistake was in using the wrong formula for calculating star numbers. I need to implement the correct formula in the function.

Now, I will write the corrected code using the right formula for star numbers. 

```python
def find_star_num(n):
    # Calculate the n-th star number using the correct formula
    return (n * (2 * n - 1) * (2 * n - 3)) // 3  # This gives the correct star number

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/268 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the n-th star number. The star numbers are a specific sequence of numbers, and for this problem, we know that the third star number is 37.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the n-th star number, we need to understand the formula or method to generate star numbers. Star numbers can be calculated using the formula: 
   \[
   S(n) = n(6n - 6 + 1) / 2
   \]
   This formula gives us the n-th star number directly. We will implement this formula in our function.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION find_star_num(n):
       RETURN n * (6 * n - 6 + 1) / 2
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def find_star_num(n):
    # Calculate the n-th star number using the formula
    return n * (6 * n - 6 + 1) // 2  # Use integer division to ensure the result is an integer

3. **Identifying the Mistake**: The formula I used does not correctly represent the sequence of star numbers. I need to find the correct formula or method to compute the n-th star number.

4. **Researching Star Numbers**: Star numbers can be defined recursively or through a specific formula. The correct formula for the n-th star number is:
   \[

   This means that the n-th star number is calculated by multiplying n by (2n - 1).
