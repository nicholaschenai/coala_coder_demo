In Python, string indexing starts at 0, so the characters at index 0, 2, 4, etc., should be included in the output.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and check the index of each character. If the index is even, we will add that character to a new string. Finally, we will return the new string that contains only the characters from even indices.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function odd_values_string(input_string):\n       create an empty string result\n       for each index and character in input_string:\n           if index is even:\n               append character to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef odd_values_string(input_string):\n    # Create an empty string to store the result\n    result = \"\"\n    # Iterate through the input string with index\n    for index in range(len(input_string)):\n        # Check if the index is even\n        if index % 2 == 0:\n            # Append the character at the even index to the result\n            result += input_string[index]\n    # Return the final result string\n    return result\n```"
