INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/226 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string.
assert odd_values_string('abcdef') == 'ace'

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/226 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string that contains only the characters from the original string that are located at even index positions. In Python, string indexing starts at 0, so the characters at index 0, 2, 4, etc., should be included in the output.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and check the index of each character. If the index is even, we will add that character to a new string. Finally, we will return the new string that contains only the characters from even indices.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function odd_values_string(input_string):
       create an empty string result
       for each index and character in input_string:
           if index is even:
               append character to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def odd_values_string(input_string):
    # Create an empty string to store the result
    result = ""
    # Iterate through the input string with index
    for index in range(len(input_string)):
        # Check if the index is even
        if index % 2 == 0:
            # Append the character at the even index to the result
            result += input_string[index]
    # Return the final result string
    return result
