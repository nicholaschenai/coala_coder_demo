# Conclusion

This work presents an implementation and evaluation of CoALA adapted for coding tasks, 
revealing that while memory systems can enhance code generation capabilities, 
the effects are highly dependent on model scale and memory quality. 
Our experiments demonstrated that large models (GPT-4o 0806) achieved modest improvements with memory augmentation, 
while smaller models (GPT-4o-mini) suffered performance degradation due to over-sensitivity to memory cues. 
However, the influence of unrelated memories on model behavior creates substantial problem state changes (Passâ†”Fail) that far outweigh net performance differences, 
rendering the results largely inconclusive with respect to memory effectiveness. 
The experiments nonetheless showcase clear cases where memory can both help 
(through algorithmic optimization guidance and edge case handling) 
and hinder (through interference from irrelevant memories and memory-induced bias), 
highlighting challenges in memory mechanisms and LLM reasoning, 
and the need for more sophisticated approaches to harness cognitive architectures for AI.
