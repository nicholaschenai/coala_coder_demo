# Detailed Analysis of Weak Positive Examples on 4o 0806

The following examples demonstrate subtle but potentially beneficial influences of retrieved memories on large model performance. While the causal relationship is less definitive than in stronger positive cases, these examples suggest that even tangentially related memories can provide valuable guidance.

### Task 432: Trapezium Median Length Calculation

**Problem**: Calculate the median length of a trapezium given specific parameters.

- ReAct's initial thoughts made an assumption about integer output so it rounded the result, leading it to fail a test case as no rounding was required.
- RAG retrieved an irrelevant memory, followed the same integer assumption as ReAct, and failed due to rounding
- CoALA retrieved a memory that implied precision handling and float usage, avoided rounding, and produced the correct result

### Task 563: String Parsing Within Quotes

**Problem**: Write a function to extract values between quotation marks from a string.

- Ground truth uses regex
- ReAct attempted to manipulate indices during scanning which caused errors, causing it to fail on a test case with side-by-side quotes `"\"This is a \"nested\"\" input string.\""`
```python
def extract_values(input_string: str) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the extracted values
    results = []
    # Initialize a counter to iterate through the string
    i = 0
    # Loop through the string
    while i < len(input_string):
        # Check if the current character is a double quote
        if input_string[i] == '"':
            # Move to the next character after the opening quote
            i += 1
            # Initialize an empty string to collect the value
            value = ''
            # Collect characters until the next double quote is found
            while i < len(input_string) and input_string[i] != '"':
                value += input_string[i]
                i += 1
            # Add the collected value to the results list
            results.append(value)
        # Move to the next character
        i += 1
    # Return the list of extracted values
    return results
```
- RAG retrieved a document about reverse Polish notation parsing that emphasized straightforward string iteration, leading to proper boundary handling
- CoALA retrieved an episodic memory of another string problem that also used direct string iteration, resulting in correct boundary handling
